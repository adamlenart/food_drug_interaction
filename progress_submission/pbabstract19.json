Detection and management of hypertension remains suboptimal due to inadequate public health care facilities. Mass migration of rural blacks to urban areas and rapid changes in lifestyle and risk factors account for the rising prevalence of hypertension, but genetic factors may also play an important contributory role. Black South Africans also appear to be more prone to complications of hypertension, particularly stroke, heart failure, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and respond poorly to ACE inhibitors as monotherapy.

Neither mean resting rCBF nor responsivity to a working memory task changed significantly with treatment. However, patients with greater lowering of systolic BP during treatment showed increased rCBF responsivity to a working memory task in medial and orbital frontal areas and decreased rCBF responsivity in mid frontal, parietal, thalamus, and pons (as well as lower thalamic rCBF pretreatment). Improved working memory performance over the treatment period was related to decreased responsivity in medial frontal, medullary, and parietal areas. Patients showing greater lowering of BP with treatment seemed to reduce excitatory and enhance inhibitory coupling between memory processing and BP more than those with less treatment success.",

Being raised on an \u03c9-3 PUFA deficient diet increased the intake of 0.5M NaCl following furosemide-induced sodium depletion by 40%. This occurred regardless of the diet they were maintained on later in life, and the increased consumption persisted for 3 days. In a second study, animals were administered furosemide and low-dose captopril. Sodium consumption of deficient raised animals was again higher than that of the control raised.

There has been compelling evidence supporting the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the genesis and perpetuation of AF through atrial remodeling, and experimental studies have validated the utilization of RAS inhibition for AF prevention. This article reviews clinical trials on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) for the prevention of AF. Results have been variable, depending on the clinical background of treated patients. ACEIs and ARBs appear beneficial for primary prevention of AF in patients with heart failure, whereas they are not equally effective in hypertensive patients with normal left ventricular function. Furthermore, the use of ACEIs or ARBs for secondary prevention of AF has been found beneficial only after electrical cardioversion. Additional data are needed to establish the potential clinical role of renin-angiotensin inhibition for prevention of AF.", 
    "12": "In the light of some new information based on clinical evidence, current therapeutic approach to patients with acute coronary syndrome especially focusing on oral therapy is being considered. The initial stage of treatment does not differ greatly among patients with unstable angina pectoris (UA), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). It is necessary to simultaneously resolve a series of problems within the first twenty minutes upon admission, i.e. risk assessment, selection of treatment strategy (conservative, invasive), relief of ischemic pain, determination of hemodynamic status and elimination of any undesired complications (hypertension, tachycardia, heart failure), and administration of antithrombotic therapy. Patients suffering from STEMI require reperfusion treatment, and the method of choice is primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) where available. Fibrinolytic reperfusion therapy is limited exclusively to STEMI within the first three hours from the onset of pain. Unlike this, in patients suffering from UA/NSTEMI it is necessary to make risk assessment in the early stage of disease, and thus select the patients that will certainly benefit from invasive treatment through PCI. For pain relief, the patient should be immediately administered nitroglycerin along with oxygen. Beta-blockers that are reasonably used in the initial stage of treatment during the first 24 hours, if not contraindicated, are still underused. Clopidogrel becomes an obligatory drug not only in patients having undergone PCI, but also in those treated conservatively following fibrinolysis.", 
    "13": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors differ in their lipophilic/hydrophilic index that determines their tissue bioavailability and affinity to ACE, which may result in major differences in the degree of blockade of cardiac ACE. We evaluated the hypothesis that in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and activated cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), lipophilic ACE inhibitors with high affinity for ACE (perindopril and quinapril) will cause marked blockade of cardiac angiotensin (Ang) II and aldosterone generation, but not a hydrophilic ACE inhibitor with low affinity for ACE (lisinopril).", 
    "14": "Patients were randomized to receive perindopril (8 mg/day), quinapril (40 mg/day), or lisinopril (20 mg/day) for 3-4 weeks before cardiac catheterization. The coronary sinus-aortic root gradients for Ang I and II, and aldosterone were determined.", 
    "15": "A total of 19 patients completed the study. Compared to a healthy control group, all three ACE inhibitors decreased circulating Ang II and aldosterone to a similar extent. There were only minor differences between the three ACE inhibitors for the Ang II gradient between the coronary sinus and aortic root. The gradient for aldosterone tended to be positive in the quinapril group and absent/negative in the lisinopril and perindopril groups. Despite the lowest pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), gradients between the coronary sinus and aortic root for Ang II and aldosterone were actually the highest in the quinapril group.",

However, accumulating data demonstrate a link between albuminuria and cardiovascular disease in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, even at very low levels of urinary albumin excretion once considered to be 'normal'. The reasons for the increase in cardiovascular risk may be linked to generalized vascular and endothelial dysfunction, mediated by the renin-angiotensin system and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor. Accordingly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated some success in treating microalbuminuria. With the prevalence of microalbuminuria at around 7% in the general population, and as high as 39% in diabetic patients, reducing and preventing microalbuminuria is becoming of increasing interest in helping to reduce cardiovascular risk. Subsequently, international guidelines have recommended screening for the presence of microalbuminuria in all patients with hypertension, diabetes or both.", 
    "18": "Hypotension can be a manifestation of transfusion reactions, including acute hemolysis, bacterial contamination, transfusion-related acute lung injury, and anaphylaxis. In addition to hypotension, these reactions usually present with other characteristic symptoms and signs. In rare cases, hypotension is the only manifestation of a transfusion reaction. This reaction, characterized by early and abrupt onset of hypotension that resolves quickly once the transfusion is stopped, is referred to as acute hypotensive transfusion reaction (AHTR). We report a case of AHTR observed in a patient on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score indicated that the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy and AHTR was probable. If a patient on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy develops AHTR, it is important to recognize the need to switch to another class of antihypertensive medication, at least while the patient continues to require transfusion.",

Through consultation of clinical charts, performance of echocardiography, and prescription of ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers were evaluated in each patient. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to test the association between age and the end-points of interest: prescription of ACE-inhibitors or beta- blockers and performance of echocardiography.",

Evaluation of echocardiography was performed in 61% of subjects under 65 and in 22% in those over 84 (p<0.001).

Data were abstracted for dose, type, and daily frequency for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists. Target doses for each medication class were based on current guidelines. Patients with devices (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, CRT with defibrillators, or CRT with pacemakers) more frequently received evidence-based medical therapy than did those without such devices, although treatment at or above target doses was low for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators 32.6%, CRT with pacemaker 30.7%, CRT with defibrillator 32.0%, no device 34.6%) and \u03b2-blockers (20.2%, 17.4%, 20.4%, and 15.3%, respectively). Fewer patients received aldosterone antagonists, although when used, doses were more frequently within the target dosing range (70.1%, 72.1%, 72.7%, and 76.5%, respectively). Multivariable models showed that use of CRT with defibrillators and CRT with pacemakers was significantly associated with delivery of \u03b2-blockers at or above target doses, but no device therapies were associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker or aldosterone antagonist dosing.",

    "27": "The optimal treatment for IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remains unknown. Some patients respond to corticosteroids, suggesting that more aggressive treatment may provide additional benefit. We performed a randomized, multicenter, controlled trial to determine whether adding azathioprine to steroids improves renal outcome. We randomly assigned 207 IgAN patients with creatinine \u22642.0 mg/dl and proteinuria \u22651.0 g/d to either (1) a 3-day pulse of methylprednisolone in months 1, 3, and 5 in addition to both oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg every other day and azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg per day for 6 months (n = 101, group 1) or (2) steroids alone on the same schedule (n = 106, group 2). The primary outcome was renal survival (time to 50% increase in plasma creatinine from baseline); secondary outcomes were changes in proteinuria over time and safety. After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, the primary endpoint occurred in 13 patients in group 1 (12.9%, 95% CI 7.5 to 20.9%) and 12 patients in group 2 (11.3%, CI 6.5 to 18.9%) (P = 0.83). Five-year cumulative renal survival was similar between groups (88 versus 89%; P = 0.83). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that female gender, systolic BP, number of antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitor use, and proteinuria during follow-up predicted the risk of reaching the primary endpoint. Treatment significantly decreased proteinuria from 2.00 to 1.07 g/d during follow-up (P < 0.001) on average, with no difference between groups. Treatment-related adverse events were more frequent among those receiving azathioprine. In summary, adding low-dose azathioprine to corticosteroids for 6 months does not provide additional benefit to patients with IgAN and may increase the risk for adverse events.", 
    "28": "Pregnancy in women diagnosed with systemic sclerosis is an infrequent situation with a generally favourable outcome according to the most recent studies. Women with systemic sclerosis who wish to become pregnant should obtain preconception counselling in order to withdraw teratogenic drugs and to carefully assess the disease activity. Severe organ impairment, early diffuse systemic sclerosis and pulmonary hypertension ought to discourage patients from pregnancy, as these situations are at high risk of complications for both mother and fetus during pregnancy and puerperium. During pregnancy, the most frequent maternal complication is worsening of gastroesophageal reflux, and the most severe complications are renal crisis and flaring arterial pulmonary hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated at any stage of the pregnancy if renal crisis is suspected. Adverse obstetric outcomes are dominated by prematurity which may be the consequence of intra-uterine growth restriction or preeclampsia. Those complications might account for systemic sclerosis-associated vasculopathy, or for the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Patients with a previous history of placental insufficiency might benefit from treatment with aspirin, low dose anticoagulants or even nitric oxide donors. During the pregnancy, abnormal bilateral uterine artery Doppler is a predictor of vascular insufficiency and might guide initiation of further preventive treatments. Multicentric prospective cohort studies are warranted to identify more precisely the predictors of pregnancy-related complications and to define the best management of these patients.", 
    "29": "Liver resection is the most effective treatment for primary liver tumours and metastasis to the liver, and remains the only potentially long-term curative therapy for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases. Nevertheless, there is a significant incidence of tumour recurrence following liver resection. Cellular and molecular changes resulting from resection and the subsequent liver regeneration process may influence the kinetics of tumour growth, contributing to recurrence. Although commonly associated with the systemic homeostasis of blood pressure, fluid and electrolyte, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has recently been shown to play a role in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis in local organs as well as in malignancies. An electronic search of the English literature on the role of the RAS in liver regeneration and tumourigenesis was performed using PubMed, with additional relevant articles sourced from reference lists. Studies have shown that the blockade of the RAS pathway stimulates liver regeneration and inhibits tumour progression. An understanding of the role of RAS in liver regeneration and tumourigenesis may enable alternative strategies to improve patient outcome and survival after liver resection. This review will discuss the role of the RAS in liver regeneration and in tumour recurrence post-liver resection. The potential of the RAS as a novel therapeutic target for CRC liver metastases patients undergoing liver resection will be outlined.", 
    "30": "Gender-specific determinants of blood pressure (BP) values and control have not been the focus of clinical hypertension research. The purpose of this analysis was to identify gender-specific and multi-level (physician and patient) determinants of BP values and predictors of uncontrolled BP. We completed a subgroup analysis comparing men and women who participated in the Belgian PREVIEW study of second-line treatment effectiveness of valsartan, applying two-level hierarchical modelling of 90-day BP values and guideline-defined BP control. In total, 1665 women and 1525 men were treated by 504 general practitioners. Fewer women than men reached systolic BP (SBP) (P=0.015) and combined BP targets at 90 days (P=0.007). More than 26% of the variance in 90-day SBP (intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.270) and diastolic BP (DBP) (ICC=0.262) was attributable to physician-level factors for men; the physician-level ICCs for SBP and DBP were 0.259 and 0.268, respectively, for women. Determinants of 90-day BP values and predictors of uncontrolled BP varied considerably by gender. Many of the multi-level determinants of BP by gender are amenable to intervention, and the remainder can serve as warning signs to clinicians that patients may remain vulnerable to poor outcomes associated with sub-optimal BP control.",

AKI was defined as an increase in serum creatinine >0.3 mg/dl or >50% from baseline. Preoperative comorbidities were more frequent in the RASI group. Operative data were similar. Incidence of postoperative AKI (19.9% vs 20.9%, P=0.815) and of postoperative renal function was comparable between groups. In the adjusted multivariate logistic regression model for propensity scores between groups, diabetes mellitus, preoperative creatinine level and perioperative transfusion were significant risk factors for postoperative AKI, whereas preoperative treatment with RAS inhibitors did not increase the risk.",

    "34": "This study describes a modification of Vane's blood-bathed organ technique (BBOT). This new technique consisted of replacing the cascade of contractile smooth muscle organs within the traditional BBOT by a single collagen strip cut from a rabbit's hind leg tendon. Utilizing the extracorporeal circulation of an anesthetized heparinized mongrel cat or Wistar rat, arterial blood was dripped (1-3 ml min(-1)) over a collagen strip. This resulted in a gain in weight of the strip, which was due to the deposition of platelet aggregates and a few blood cells trapped over the strip. Arterial blood that had been used for the superfusion was pumped back into the animal's venous system. However, when this technique is adapted to human volunteers, the superfusing blood should be discarded. In animal experiments, intravenous injections of a variety of classic fibrinolytic agents (e.g., streptokinase) promoted the formation of platelet thrombi. Nitric oxide donors (e.g., SIN-1) at non-hypotensive doses hardly affected the mass of platelet thrombi deposited over the collagen strip, whereas endogenous prostacyclin (e.g., released from vascular endothelium by bradykinin) or exogenous prostacyclin and its stable analogues (e.g., iloprost) dissipated platelet thrombi as measured by a loss in the weight of the blood superfused collagen strip. This model allowed us to assay numerous drugs for their releasing properties of endogenous prostacyclin from vascular endothelium. These drugs included lipophilic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is), which act in vivo as bradykinin potentiating factors (BPF). Other PGI(2)-releasers included statins (e.g., atorvastatin and simvastatin), thienopyridines (e.g., ticlopidine and clopidogrel), a number of thromboxane synthase inhibitors, flavonoids, bradykinin itself, cholinergic M receptor agonists and nicotinic acid derivatives. The thrombolytic actions of lipophilic ACE-Is (e.g., quinapril and perindopril) were prevented by pretreatment with either bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonists (e.g., icatibant) or with endothelial COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., rofecoxib, celecoxib and high dose aspirin). The inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthetase (eNOS) by L-NAME hardly blunted the thrombolytic response to ACE-Is. Hence, it can be concluded that many recognized cardiovascular drugs apart from their known basic mechanisms of action, may also behave as releasers of endogenous endothelial prostacyclin. Furthermore, in many instances, this effect may be the primary mechanism of their therapeutic efficacy.",

    "36": "Twelve patients with impaired fasting glucose completed the double-blind, randomized, crossover trial. Patients received telmisartan (160 mg/day) or placebo for 3 weeks and vice versa with a 2-week washout period. At the end of each period, a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HEC) combined with indirect calorimetry was performed. During HEC (0, 30, and 120 min), plasma levels of adipokines were measured and a needle biopsy (0 and 30 min) of SAT was performed.", 
    "37": "Fasting plasma glucose was lower after telmisartan compared with placebo (P<0.05). There were no differences in insulin sensitivity and substrate utilization. We found no differences in basal plasma adiponectin, resistin and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), but an increase was found in basal leptin, after telmisartan treatment. Insulin-stimulated plasma adiponectin (P<0.05), leptin and resistin (P<0.001) were increased, whereas TNF\u03b1 was decreased (P<0.05) after telmisartan treatment. Expression of resistin, but not adiponectin, TNF\u03b1 and leptin was increased after telmisartan treatment.", 
    "38": "Despite the decrease in fasting plasma glucose, telmisartan does not improve insulin sensitivity and substrate utilization. Telmisartan increases plasma leptin as well as insulin-stimulated plasma adiponectin, leptin and resistin, and decreases plasma TNF\u03b1 during HEC. Changes in plasma adipokines cannot be explained by their expressions in SAT. The changes in plasma adipokines might be involved in the metabolic effects of telmisartan in metabolic syndrome.", 
    "39": "A great number of milk-derived peptides have been shown to exhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties and thus potential utility in the regulation of blood pressure. The present work aimed to investigate the effects of 2 milk trypsin hydrolysates from alpha(S1)- and alpha(S2)-casein (CH1 and CH2, respectively) on ACE activity evaluated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro, rat aortic tissues ex vivo, and renovascular hypertensive rat in vivo. Incubation of HUVEC and rat aortic tissues with CH1 or CH2 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of hydrolysis of the ACE substrate hippuryl-histidyl-leucine (HHL), the hydrolysates being much less potent than perindopril (an ACE inhibitor). However, in contrast to perindopril, CH1 and CH2 failed to modify angiotensin I-induced aortic ring vasoconstriction. The HPLC profiles of rat plasma after intragastric administration were variable among individuals but none of the observed peaks corresponded to peptides comprising CH1 or CH2 or to fragments of these peptides. During 4 wk of cardiovascular monitoring, in hydrolysate-fed renovascular hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure weakly decreased compared with the control group. However, the CH1-fed hypertensive rats exhibited a decrease of heart rate during the nocturnal period of activity. To conclude, our results show that CH1 and CH2 inhibited ACE activity in HUVEC and rat aortic tissue but failed to antagonize the aortic-constricting effects of the natural agonist angiotensin I. Moreover, we demonstrated that CH1, to a greater extent than CH2, can slightly affect cardiovascular parameters although the ingested bioactive peptides could not be detected in the blood.",

The API-4000 LC-MS/MS was operated under the multiple-reaction monitoring mode using electrospray ionization. Analytes and IS were extracted from plasma by simple liquid-liquid extraction technique using ethyl acetate. The reconstituted samples were chromatographed on C(18) column by pumping 0.1% formic acid-acetonitrile (15:85, v/v) at a flow rate of 1\u2009mL/min. A detailed validation of the method was performed as per the FDA guidelines and the standard curves were found to be linear in the range of 0.26-210\u2009ng/mL for ATO; 0.05-20.5\u2009ng/mL for AML; 0.25-208\u2009ng/mL for RAM and 0.74-607\u2009ng/mL for BEN with mean correlation coefficient of \u22650.99 for each analyte. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy results were well with in the acceptable limits. A run time of 2.5\u2009min for each sample made it possible to analyze more than 400 human plasma samples per day. The developed assay method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study in human male volunteers.", 
    "41": "Early cardiovascular disease starts in the endothelium leading to functional changes in the vasculature. These changes can be depicted by assessment of arterial stiffness or elasticity. There are several techniques to assess arterial stiffness. Increased arterial stiffness or decreased arterial elasticity has been associated with cardiovascular risk factors. There is now evidence that small artery elasticity is a strong predictor for arterial hypertension. Moreover arterial elasticity provides extra prognostic information beyond arterial blood pressure measurement. Arterial stiffness attenuation may reflect the true reduction of arterial wall damage.", 
    "42": "ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists and calcium antagonists have favorable effects in improving arterial elasticity, while beta-blockers have an inverse effect. Diuretics have not been evaluated. Lipid lowering therapy, some antidiabetic therapy have shown to reduce arterial stiffness.

    "44": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an important role in the endocrine pancreas. Multiple researches have shown that even in the insulin resistance phase, there are many abnormalities in islets morphology and function. This study aimed at investigating the effects of RAS blockade on the islets function in rats with long-term high-fat diet and its mechanisms. Wistar rats with 16-week high-fat diet were randomly divided into perindopril intervention group (FP, n = 15) and telmisartan intervention group (FT, n = 15). After 8-week intervention, insulin sensitivity and islets function were detected by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp and intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT), respectively. The pancreases were stained by immunohistochemistry technique to qualitatively and/or quantitatively analyze the relative content of insulin (IRC), NF-KB, uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and caspase-3 in islets. The apoptosis of islet cells was detected by TUNEL. The expression of angiotensin II receptor 1 (AT1R), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), hypoxia-inducing factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and CHOP mRNA in the islets was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Compared with normal control group (NC, n = 15), the glucose infusion rate (GIR), area under the insulin curve (AUCI) of 0-10 min and IRC were decreased in high-fat control group (FC, n = 15). The relative content of NF-KB, UCP-2 and caspase-3 was increased significantly with the increased number of apoptotic cells in unit islets area. The relative expression of AT1R, IL-1\u03b2, HIF-1\u03b1 and CHOP was also increased evidently (all P < 0.01). After intervention, the GIR, AUCI of 0-10 min and IRC were all increased obviously with the decreased relative concentration of NF-KB, UCP-2, caspase-3 and the number of apoptotic cell in unit islets area. The relative expression of AT1R, IL-1\u03b2, HIF-1\u03b1 and CHOP mRNA was reduced significantly (all P < 0.01 or P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between groups FP and FT. So we concluded that blockade of RAS may protect islet function of rats with long-term high-fat diet via downregulation of islets inflammation, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis, which have tight relationship with each other.",

We compared the incidence of retinopathy regression in 90 hypertensive type 2 diabetics randomized to at least 3-year blinded ACEi with trandolapril (2 mg/day) or non-ACEi therapy who had preproliferative or proliferative retinopathy at baseline. Results. Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up period of 35.8 (12.4-60.7) months, retinopathy regressed in 27 patients (30.0%). Regression occurred in 18 of 42 patients (42.9%) on ACEi and in 9 of 48 (18.8%) on non-ACEi therapy (adjusted for predefined baseline covariates HR (95% CI): 2.75 (1.18-6.42), P = .0193). Concomitant treatment with or without Non-Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers (ndCCBs) did not appreciably affect the incidence of retinopathy regression. Conclusions.

The 5-HT molecules were shown to be selectively captured via formation of a strong complex, providing anodic stripping currents upon anodic scan or drastic increases in charge-transfer resistances for a redox probe, Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) pair, due to their blocking effects. The 5-HT molecules thus collected were subsequently detected by anodic stripping differential pulse voltammetry (ASDPV) or electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The detection limit was 1.2 when detected by EIS and 28 nM with ASDPV. 5-HT was shown to be determined in physiological matrices containing ascorbic acid, dopamine, and other commonly encountered neurotransmitters.", 
    "51": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have clinically been widely used as anti-hypertensive agents. In the present study, we compared the effects of a centrally active ACE inhibitor, perindopril, with those of non-centrally active ACE inhibitors, imidapril and enalapril, on cognitive performance in amyloid beta(Abeta) (25-35)-injected mice, a rodent model of Alzheimer's disease. We also determined the brain ACE activity in order to elucidate the relationship between the cognitive function and ACE inhibition in the brain. Abeta(25-35)-injected mice showed a cognitive impairment in spontaneous alteration and object recognition tests, the indices of immediate working memory and relatively long-term recognition memory, respectively. As indicated by these tests, the oral administration of perindopril (0.1, 0.3 or 1mg/kg/day) significantly reversed the cognitive impairment in these mice, whereas neither imidapril (0.3, 1 or 3mg/kg/day) nor enalapril (1, 3 or 10mg/kg/day) had any effect on cognitive performance. Perindopril (1mg/kg/day), imidapril (3mg/kg/day), or enalapril (10mg/kg/day) all inhibited the plasma ACE activities by more than 90%. Using the same dosing regimen, only perindopril inhibited the brain ACE activities by more than 50%, whereas imidapril and enalapril showed much less potent effects. These results suggest that perindopril ameliorated the cognitive impairment in the Alzheimer's disease model mice through the inhibition of brain ACE activity, but not peripheral ACE activity. Based on our observations, we concluded that a centrally active ACE inhibitor, perindopril, may therefore have a beneficial effect on Alzheimer's disease as well as hypertension.", 
    "52": "Antihypertensive agents exert different effects on insulin sensitivity, lipids and haemostasis. However, most studies assessing these effects were small and short-term yielding conflicting results. Moreover, it has not been established whether the impact of antihypertensive drugs on insulin sensitivity, lipids, thrombosis and fibrinolysis adds to or attenuates vascular risk reduction. On the other hand, new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) appears to be more frequent in patients treated with \u03b2-blockers and diuretics, whereas angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers might reduce the risk for T2DM and calcium channel blockers have a neutral effect. Therefore, the risk of developing T2DM should be considered when selecting an antihypertensive agent. This review discusses the differential effects of antihypertensive drugs on insulin sensitivity, lipids and haemostasis and considers their association with vascular risk.", 
    "53": "The combined use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) poses a dilemma to clinicians. On the one hand, indirect evidence from compelling, but still surrogate outcome measures such as blood pressure and proteinuria suggest some merits of this combination. On the other hand, the outcome benefits of the ACEIs+ARBs combination in morbidity/mortality trials remain confined to patients with severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and reduced ejection fraction. Incidentally, most of the benefit offered by the ACEIs+ARBs combination in these patients was not driven by mortality, but by fewer rehospitalizations for CHF. Even in patients with renal disease and proteinuria, the combined use of ACEIs and ARBs, although highly effective in reducing urinary protein excretion, has not yet been proven to significantly delay end-stage renal disease and the need for dialysis. In the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and In Combination With Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), the dual blockade of the renin angiotensin system did not produce additional outcome benefit over that afforded by ACE inhibition alone. Notably, however, patients with BP >160/100 mmHg at entry were excluded from ONTARGET, thus limiting the applicability of these results to the treatment of hypertension. The European Society of Hypertension guidelines do not suggest large-scale use of the ACEIs+ARBs combination in patients with hypertension. However, patients with resistant hypertension, particularly if proteinuria coexists, could benefit from this combination, which however requires close monitoring for adverse events, including hyperkalemia and worsening renal function.", 
    "54": "Central arterial systolic blood pressure is a very important factor in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Central arterial pressure is a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than peripheral brachial blood pressure. Measurement of central blood pressure is useful for a diagnosis of spurious systolic hypertension in young people. Antihypertensive drugs have a different impact on central blood pressure, for example angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, antagonists of angiotensin II receptors, calcium channel blockers more effectively lower central blood pressure than betablockers, despite all of those drugs (including beta-blockers) having a similar impact on peripheral pressure. This mechanism may be responsible for the beneficial effect of some antihypertensive drugs on cardiovascular end points observed in clinical trials, despite a low peripheral hypotensive effect. However, further clinical trials are required to provide more evidence for the prognostic and therapeutic implications of the measurement of central blood pressure before adopting its routine application in clinical practice.",

There is a particular interest in the determination of the ellagic acid content in fruits because of possible chemopreventive benefits. In the present study, the potential health benefits of purified ellagitannins from strawberries were evaluated in relation to the antiproliferative activity and in vitro inhibition of \u03b1-amylase, \u03b1-glucosidase, and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) relevant for potential management of hyperglycemia and hypertension. Therefore, a comparison among ellagic acid, purified ellagitannins, and a strawberry extract was done to evaluate the possible synergistic effects of phenolics. In relation to the antiproliferative activity, it was observed that ellagic acid had the highest percentage inhibition of cell proliferation. The strawberry extract had lower efficacy in inhibiting the cell proliferation, indicating that in the case of this fruit there is no synergism. Purified ellagitannins had high \u03b1-amylase and ACE inhibitory activities. However, these compounds had low \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity. These results suggested that the ellagitannins and ellagic acid have good potential for the management of hyperglycemia and hypertension linked to type 2 diabetes. However, further studies with animal and human models are needed to advance the in vitro assay-based biochemical rationale from this study.",

The total phenolics content was 11 and 51 mg/g of sample dry weight for CP and CP-SAB, respectively. p-Coumaric acid and quercetin derivatives were the main phenolic compounds identified in the cranberry powders. CP-SAB had \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory activity that increased with increased dose (1-5 mg/mL) from 60% to 100% inhibition. There was limited amount of \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity that reached a maximum of 40% inhibition at 5 mg/mL treatment. Significant ACE inhibitory activity was detected for CP-SAB at 100 and 200 mg/mL sample concentrations. These in vitro results indicate the potential of cranberry powders as dietary supplement and food-based strategies for potential hyperglycemia management.

    "57": "Early initiation of rational and effective combination therapy consisting of antihypertensive drugs with two different and complementary mechanisms of actions is increasingly becoming accepted in clinical practice and by guidelines as a first-line approach to control blood pressure (BP) and prevent cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertension. Once-daily combination therapy provides more rapid control of BP, which is important for preventing cardiovascular events, with similar or improved tolerability compared with the component monotherapies, and improved adherence because of regimen simplification. Combination therapy with a calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a rational approach to achieve BP goals and provide protection against renal and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations, including CCB/angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and CCB/ angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist (angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) combinations are available as fixed-dose formulations. There is substantial evidence for the BP-lowering efficacy of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations in diverse patient populations, and their use in combination is associated with favourable tolerability and fewer adverse metabolic effects than some other combination therapies. Recent evidence from large outcome trials supports the use of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in high-risk patients, together with evidence that the benefits of CCB/RAAS inhibitor combinations may extend beyond their efficacy in lowering BP in terms of protecting against fatal and nonfatal stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths. The efficacy of the CCB amlodipine and the ARB valsartan in lowering BP and protecting against cardiovascular events and stroke across a range of hypertensive patient populations has been established over many years. Fixed-dose amlodipine/valsartan combinations are available in many countries and have shown greater BP reductions and better BP control than the respective monotherapies in diverse patient populations, together with a favourable tolerability profile. Once-daily amlodipine/valsartan is a rational and convenient treatment option for the effective management of patients with hypertension, improving adherence to antihypertensive medication and protecting against cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality.",

Goals for risk-stratifying patients with AHFS in OUs include determining patients suitable for OU management and determining end points of treatment. Although many provider models and settings exist, management algorithms common to most OUs include monitoring/nursing care, diagnostic procedures, therapy, and educational/social services. The focus of OU management involves an assessment of the factors that led to the decompensation and identification of the predominant clinical features such as hypertension and congestion. Acute therapy still leans heavily on symptom relief with diuretics and nitroglycerin. For newly diagnosed patients, initiation of guideline-recommended therapies like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers is an integral part of OU protocols. Patient education and coordination of outpatient care continues to be paramount in preventing early readmission in this patient population.",

All drugs lowered (but not normalized) mean arterial pressure in SHR equi-effectively, as monitored by radiotelemetry, without altering heart rate. All drugs also reduced the increased cardiomyocyte area in SHR, and tended to normalize the elevated brain natriuretic peptide plasma levels. In the Langendorff set-up, all drugs normalized the diminished endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to bradykinin in SHR. Moreover, aliskiren and irbesartan, but not captopril, decreased the enhanced coronary Ang II response in SHR. Aliskiren reduced plasma renin activity and the plasma and tissue angiotensin levels at 1 week of treatment; yet, after 3 weeks of aliskiren treatment only the cardiac angiotensin levels remained suppressed, whereas no tissue angiotensin reductions were seen with captopril or irbesartan.",

    "73": "Most clinicians monitor blood pressure to estimate a patient's response to blood pressure-lowering therapy. However, the apparent change may not actually reflect the effect of the treatment, because a person's blood pressure varies considerably even without the administration of drug therapy. We estimated random background within-person variation, apparent between-person variation, and true between-person variation in blood pressure response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors after 3 months. We used meta-analytic mixed models to analyze individual patient data from 28 281 participants in 7 randomized, controlled trials from the Blood Pressure Lowering Trialists Collaboration. The apparent between-person variation in response was large, with SDs for change in systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure of 15.2/8.5 mm Hg. Within-person variation was also large, with SDs for change in systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure of 14.9/8.45 mm Hg. The true between-person variation in response was small, with SDs for change in systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure of 2.6/1.0 mm Hg. The proportion of the apparent between-person variation in response that was attributed to true between-person variation was only 3% for systolic blood pressure and 1% for diastolic blood pressure. In conclusion, most of the apparent variation in response is not because of true variation but is a consequence of background within-person fluctuation in day-to-day blood pressure levels. Instead of monitoring an individual's blood pressure response, a better approach may be to simply assume the mean treatment effect.",

Because eicosanoids derived from PUFA are involved in regulating blood pressure, we hypothesized that PUFA can regulate the expression of the vasodilator ACE2. Preadipocytes from Landrace pigs were induced to differentiate for 4 d, then treated with 50 \u03bcM of different PUFA, CLA, arachidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), or stearic acid (18:0). Addition of EPA or 18:0 for 48 h did not change the ACE2 mRNA abundance, whereas the treatments of arachidonic acid, CLA, and DHA significantly decreased ACE2 mRNA abundance after 48 h (P \u2264 0.05). Treatment with PUFA did not change (P > 0.05) type I and type II angiotensin receptor mRNA abundance. To further understand how PUFA metabolites affect ACE2 mRNA expression, we inhibited individual enzymes that are involved in eicosanoid production. We found that 3 individual eicosanoid pathway enzyme inhibitors recovered the PUFA effect on the expression of ACE2, indicating these pathways are involved in mediating the PUFA function.

However, absence of effect on overall mortality found in the DIG study associated with frequent adverse effects due to overdosing in elderly patients with impaired renal function finally persuaded medical opinion to the weak interest of digoxin in chronic heart failure. Its image of old-fashioned drug in the mind of young cardiology generations appears widely distorted, and suffers from the absence of promotion by pharmaceutical industry, given a very low cost and a rapid arrival onto the generic market. Yet, regarding strict data from the literature, it remains a lot of positive factors in favor of the interest for digoxin: reduction of morbidity, reduction of mortality at low serum concentration <1.0 ng/ml, very low cost with favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.

    "109": "Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is commonly administered therapeutically and is routinely associated with late delayed radiation injuries, manifesting as severe and irreversible cognitive impairment. Neural progenitors within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus are among the most radiosensitive cell types in the adult brain and are known to participate in hippocampal plasticity and normal cognitive function. These progenitors and the specialized SGZ microenvironment required for neuronal differentiation are the source of neurogenic potential in the adult dentate gyrus, and provide a continuous supply of immature neurons which may then migrate into the adjacent granule cell layer to become mature granule cell neurons. The extreme radiosensitivity of these progenitors and the SGZ microenvironment implicate them as potentially significant contributors to radiation-induced cognitive impairment. Previous reports suggest that statin drugs may be neuroprotective and may promote neurogenesis within the SGZ following both traumatic and ischemic brain injury. Here we investigate whether atorvastatin might similarly protect progenitors and/or preserve neurogenic potential within the SGZ when administered following radiation injury. We also investigate whether such mitigating effects might be enhanced by administering atorvastatin in combination with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, which has previously been shown to produce subtle mitigating effects in this context. Atorvastatin was administered to adult male Fisher 344 rats beginning 24 h post-WBI at doses of 10 and 15 Gy, and maintained daily until sacrifice at 12 weeks post-WBI. Combined atorvastatin and ramipril (atorvastatin + ramipril) were administered according to the same protocol following WBI doses of 10 Gy. Progenitor proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and microglial activation were assayed immunohistochemically. Our results indicate that chronic administration of atorvastatin is relatively ineffective as a mitigator of radiation injury in this context, whereas atorvastatin + ramipril appear to interact synergistically to potently and selectively mitigate radiation-induced disruption of neurogenic signaling within SGZ microenvironment.",

Here, we used ob/ob mice, a model lacking leptin, to answer the question whether ACE and leptin could interact to influence blood pressure, thereby linking the renin-angiotensin system and obesity. These mice are obese and diabetic but have normal 24 h mean arterial pressure. Our results show that plasma and lung ACE activities as well as ACE mRNA expression were significantly decreased in ob/ob mice. In agreement with these findings, the hypotensive effect produced by enalapril administration was attenuated in the obese mice. Plasma renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin I, bradykinin, and angiotensin 1-7 were increased, whereas plasma angiotensin II concentration was unchanged in obese mice. Chronic infusion of leptin increased renin activity and angiotensin II concentration in both groups and increased ACE activity in ob/ob mice. Acute leptin infusion restored ACE activity in leptin-deficient mice. Moreover, the effect of an ACE inhibitor on blood pressure was not changed in ob/+ mice during leptin treatment but increased four times in obese mice. In summary, our findings show that the renin-angiotensin system is altered in ob/ob mice, with markedly reduced ACE activity, which suggests a possible connection between the renin-angiotensin system and leptin. These results point to an important interplay between the angiotensinergic and the leptinergic systems, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of obesity, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome.",

We revealed that Ang-(1-9) enhanced electrically stimulated arterial thrombosis in the carotid artery of Wistar rats. Losartan, a selective blocker of AT1 receptor for Ang II, abolished the prothrombotic activity of Ang-(1-9). This peptide increased plasma level of fibrinogen, augments fibrin generation, and similarly to Ang II, potentiated collagen induced platelet aggregation. Using HPLC, we found that after incubation of Ang-(1-9) with platelet homogenates or after intravenous administration this peptide is converted to Ang II. We concluded that Ang-(1-9) exerts an Ang II-like prothrombotic effect due to the conversion to Ang II in the circulatory system of rats and that platelets are involved in this process.",

Today the approach to SCD prevention includes considering both the setting of patients who have already presented a cardiac arrest or a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias (secondary prevention of SCD) and the much broader setting of primary prevention in patients at variable degrees of identifiable risk. For secondary prevention of SCD, implantable cardioverter defibrillation is now the standard of care (the risk of overall mortality may be reduced by 20-31%), and anti-arrhythmic agents, specifically amiodarone, have only a complementary role (for reducing device activations or for preventing atrial fibrillation). For primary prevention of SCD in high-risk patients, cardioverter defibrillators have nowadays specific indications in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (often in combination with cardiac resynchronization therapy), where the risk of overall mortality may be reduced by 23-54%. For the large number of subjects who have some risk of SCD, but are not identified as at high risk of SCD, a series of drugs could exert a favorable effect (beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker agents, statins, omega-3 fatty acids and aldosterone antagonists), and for some of them evidence is emerging, from subgroup analysis, of possible SCD prevention capabilities.", 
    "131": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have become the cornerstone in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD), as numerous lines of evidence have shown that these agents have a blood pressure lowing independent anti-proteinuric effect. However, despite the benefits of ACEI or ARB therapy, a substantial proportion of patients still experience renal morbidity and mortality. Considering the prognostic impact of proteinuria reduction, it is currently assumed that titration of ACEI or ARB for optimal anti-proteinuric effect would be a logical step towards improvement of renoprotection. Recent published studies, performed with higher than recommended doses of either ACEI or particularly ARB, suggest that the approach is associated with a further decrement in urinary protein excretion and probably improved renal outcome. Although most patients achieve their maximum benefit at standard doses, there is a residual group of patients who may do so at higher doses of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. Because patients who would benefit from higher doses are not identifiable a priori, a titration process might be cogent in order to provide more robust anti-proteinuric benefit to such patients.", 
    "132": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined according to a decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and kidney damage such as proteinuria or albuminuria. Dip-stick proteinuria is only sensitive to albumin and correlates poorly with quantitative 24 h proteinuria, the most commonly used measure in renoprotective randomized controlled clinical trials (RCT). The amount of proteinuria correlates with the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in non-diabetics in RCT. Random urine protein to creatinine ratio (PCR) or albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) correlates with 24 h urinary excretion. Dip-stick proteinuria correlates poorly with ACR, while PCR correlates reasonably well with ACR. Because of a high analytical variability, efforts are in progress to standardize ACR (but not PCR) measurement. There have been no studies on the direct comparison between proteinuria and albuminuria in terms of utilities (biomarker, surrogate end-point and cost-effectiveness). In this regard, both proteinuria and albuminuria are good biomarkers for cardiovascular events, renal events or mortality. However, there are limitations in RCT regarding the validity of proteinuria or albuminuria as a surrogate end-point. In contrast, measuring proteinuria or albuminuria followed by treatment with angiotensin inhibitors is cost-effective for diabetics, hypertension and aging. CKD guidelines differ in their opinions regarding the choice between ACR and PCR. Based on the current evidence, ACR might be recommended for the diabetics and PCR for the non-diabetics.",

Despite statutory urinalysis of industrial workers and school children, Japan unfortunately still ranks among the countries with the highest CKD-5D prevalence in the world. Topics of this review are as follow: (i) early diagnosis and treatment; (ii) influence of the period from onset to medical intervention on renal prognosis; and (iii) epidemiology of IgA nephropathy patients in Japan. Some investigators have discussed the possibility of predicting the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. We indicated that the frequency of various casts in urinary sediments and total numbers of each type of urinary cast should provide highly convincing data for prediction of the prognosis in IgA nephropathy patients prior to renal biopsy. Furthermore, early medical intervention (anti-platelet agents, anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, corticosteroids and/or tonsillectomy) may lead to better renal prognosis in patients with IgA nephropathy. In a nationwide survey on IgA nephropathy in Japan, predictive factors after 10 years were as follows: (i) male sex; (ii) under 30 years old; (iii) diastolic hypertension; (iv) heavy proteinuria; (v) mild haematuria; (vi) low serum albumin; and (vii) elevated serum creatinine and impaired renal pathology.

    "149": "We randomized patients with chronic kidney disease (serum creatinine \u2265 1.5 mg/dl or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2) in a double-blind fashion to receive saline or sodium bicarbonate prior to and after cardiac or vascular angiography. The primary endpoint was contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), defined as an increase in serum creatinine by 25% or by 0.5 mg/dl from baseline. Patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), cardiac ejection fraction (EF) <30%, or GFR < 20 ml/min/1.73 m\u00b2 were excluded. The study was discontinued (after 142 patients were randomized) due to a low incidence of CIN (1.5%). We retrospectively identified all cases of CIN (n = 30) at our institution during the same time period to see if these patients differed from our trial sample. There was no difference in serum creatinine (1.7 \u00b1 0.4 vs. 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 mg/dL), GFR (42.7 \u00b1 9.7 vs. 45.3 \u00b1 3.2 ml/min), incidence of diabetes (51.8% vs. 63.3%), contrast volume (121.7 \u00b1 63.8 vs. 122.7 \u00b1 68.3 ml), ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use (54.0% vs 63.3%), and periprocedure diuretic use (33.1% vs 26.7%). On multivariate analysis, only a cardiac ejection fraction (EF) of less than 40% was significantly associated with CIN (odds ratio, 4.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-15.71; P = 0.02). In all, 22/30 patients (73.3%) who developed CIN had at least one or more characteristics that would have excluded their enrollment in our randomized trial including evidence of congestive heart failure (17/30 patients), EF less than 30% (9 patients), age greater than 85 years (2 patients), or advanced renal failure with a baseline GFR of less than 20 cc/min (1 patient). In summary, patients with CKD without evidence of CHF who receive adequate hydration appear to have a very low risk of CIN associated with angiography. A low EF (less than 40%) appeared to be the most significant risk factor for CIN in our population.", 
    "150": "The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease following chronic renal failure (CRF). We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin, the principal curcuminoid of the Indian curry spice turmeric, in attenuation of LVH and sought to delineate the associated signaling pathways in blunting the hypertrophic response in nephrectomized rats. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats underwent nephrectomy (Nx) by removal of 5/6 of the kidneys. Four groups were studied for 7 wk: 1) control (sham), 2) Nx, 3) Nx + curcumin (150 mg/kg bid), and 4) Nx + enalapril (15 mg/kg bid) as positive control. Subtotal nephrectomy caused renal dysfunction, as evidenced by a gradual increase in proteinuria and elevation in blood urea nitrogen and plasma creatinine. Nx rats showed a significant hypertrophic response and increased diameter of inferior vena cava at inspiration, which was inhibited by treatment with curcumin or enalapril. Moreover, the Nx rats demonstrated changes in the signaling molecules critically involved in the hypertrophic response. These include increased glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, \u03b2-catenin expression, calcineurin, phosphorylated (p) nuclear factor of activated T cells, pERK, and p-cAMP-dependent kinase. Both curcumin and enalapril variably but effectively deactivated these pathways. Curcumin attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in nephrectomized rats through deactivation of multiple hypertrophic signaling pathways. Considering the safety of curcumin, these studies should facilitate future clinical trials in suppressing hypertrophy in patients with CRF.",

Fluid was collected from the vas deferens, subjected to 2-D SDS-PAGE and spots identified by CapLC-MS/MS and MALDI-ToF/ToF. Because albumin accounted for 21.1% of all spot intensities in the gels examined by PDQuest, samples were subjected to albumin depletion and then analyzed again as before. Original CEF gels had 114 \u00b1 3 spots, including as the most abundant: albumin, epididymal secretory protein E1, prostaglandin d-synthase and gelsolin. Epididymal fluid also expressed: clusterin, transferrin, N-acetyl-\u03b2-glucosaminidase, cauxin, glutathione peroxidase, acidic seminal fluid protein (aSFP), aldehyde reductase, \u03b1-l-fucosidase, \u03b1-1-\u03b2-glycoprotein, apolipoprotein A-1, \u03b2 actin, calmodulin, cathepsin D, cystatin E/M, enolase, galectin 3-binding protein, leucine amino-peptidase and nucleobindin. Albumin depletion decreased that very spot to 10% of its original intensity and the resulting gels had, on average, 137 \u00b1 4 spots. Spots identified as dipeptidyl-peptidase 7, angiotensin-converting enzyme, arylsulfatase A, aspartylglucosaminidase, serine protease inhibitors, new isoforms of calmodulin, cystatin E/M and a 17-kDa nucleobindin appeared only in depleted maps. This study is the first to report nucleobindin and aSFP as epididymal components. We suggest that CEF proteins act to facilitate membrane remodeling, transport of lipophilic substances, protect sperm and prevent premature acrosome reaction.", 
    "152": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used as blood pressure medications in hypertensive individuals. However, ACE inhibitors also play an integral role in the breakdown of neuronal substance P, which has been recently implicated in the development of functional deficits following traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study therefore examined the effects of ACE inhibitors on histological and motor outcome following TBI. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with Captopril, Enalapril or equal volume saline for 7 days prior to the induction of diffuse TBI using the impact acceleration model. At 5h post-injury, animals administered Captopril demonstrated significantly increased substance P immunoreactivity compared to vehicle controls (p<0.01), and increased dark cell change that persisted to 7 days post-trauma. Captopril also resulted in exacerbated motor deficits compared to vehicle treated animals (p<0.05) as assessed by the rotarod test over a 7-day post-traumatic period. Administration of the alternative ACE inhibitor, Enalapril, likewise exacerbated motor deficits, confirming a class effect of ACE inhibitors rather than a compound effect specific to Captopril. We conclude that ACE inhibitors are deleterious to outcome following TBI, presumably by impairing the degradation of substance P and increasing substance P mediated neuronal injury.", 
    "153": "Endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), a key peptidase in the endothelin (ET) system, cleaves inactive big ET-1 to produce active ET-1, which binds to ET(A) receptors to exert its vasoconstrictor and pressor effects. ECE inhibition could be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension. In this study, a set of eight lactoferricin B (LfcinB)-derived peptides, previously characterized in our laboratory as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides, was examined for their inhibitory effects on ECE. In vitro inhibitory effects on ECE activity were assessed using both the synthetic fluorogenic peptide substrate V (FPS V) and the natural substrate big ET-1. To study vasoactive effects, an ex vivo functional assay was developed using isolated rabbit carotid artery segments. With FPS V, only four LfcinB-derived peptides induced inhibition of ECE activity, whereas the eight peptides showed ECE inhibitory effects with big ET-1 as substrate. Regarding the ex vivo assays, six LfcinB-derived peptides showed inhibition of big ET-1-induced, ECE-dependent vasoconstriction. A positive correlation between the inhibitory effects of LfcinB-derived peptides on ECE activity when using big ET-1 and the inhibitory effects on ECE-dependent vasoconstriction was shown. ECE-independent vasoconstriction induced by ET-1 was not affected, thus discarding effects of LfcinB-derived peptides on ET(A) receptors or intracellular signal transduction mechanisms. In conclusion, a combined in vitro and ex vivo method to assess the effects of potentially antihypertensive peptides on the ET system has been developed and applied to show the inhibitory effects on ECE-dependent vasoconstriction of six LfcinB-derived peptides, five of which were dual vasopeptidase (ACE/ECE) inhibitors.",

The inhibitor binds exclusively in the S(1) and S(2) binding pockets of AnCE (coordinating the zinc ion) through ionic and hydrogen bond interactions. A detailed structural comparison of AnCE.K-26 complex with individual domains of human somatic ACE provides useful information for further exploration of ACE inhibitor pharmacophores involving phosphonic acids.", 
    "155": "Bitter taste signaling in humans is mediated by a group of 25 bitter receptors (T2Rs) that belong to the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Previously, several bitter peptides were isolated and characterized from bitter tasting food protein derived extracts, such as pea protein and soya bean extracts. However, the molecular targets or receptors in humans for these bitter peptides were poorly characterized and least understood. In this study, we tested the ability of the bitter tasting tri- and di-peptides to activate the human bitter receptor, T2R1. In addition, we tested the ability of peptide inhibitors of the blood pressure regulatory protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) to activate T2R1. Using a heterologous expression system, T2R1 gene was transiently expressed in C6-glioma cells and changes in intracellular calcium was measured following addition of the peptides. We found that the bitter tasting tri-peptides are more potent in activating T2R1 than the di-peptides tested. Among the peptides examined, the bitter tri-peptide Phe-Phe-Phe (FFF), is the most potent in activating T2R1 with an EC50 value in the micromolar range. Furthermore, to elucidate the potential ligand binding pocket of T2R1 we used homology molecular modeling. The molecular models showed that the bitter peptides bind within the same binding pocket on the receptor. The ligand binding pocket in T2R1 is present on the extracellular surface of the receptor, and is formed by the transmembrane helices 1, 2, 3 and 7 and with extracellular loops 1 and 2 forming a cap like structure on the binding pocket.",

An undetermined hepatopathy also was found at presentation and resolved after metronidazole antimicrobial treatment. Cardiopulmonary medical treatment, including a loop diuretic, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocker, and a bronchodilator provided improvement of the clinical signs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of antemortem diagnosis and treatment of congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy in a member of the family Procyonidae, suggesting that HCM should be considered as a differential diagnosis in kinkajous displaying clinical signs of dyspnea and exercise intolerance.", 
    "162": "There has been much recent interest in the role of aldosterone as an independent contributor to the progression of chronic kidney disease. Despite treatment with agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, many studies have shown that there is incomplete blockade of the renin-angiotensin cascade evidenced by persistent or rising plasma aldosterone levels despite therapeutic renin-angiotensin blockade. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as \"aldosterone escape\" and is thought to be one of the main contributors to chronic kidney disease progression despite conventional therapeutics. Animal models of the effects of exposure to exogenous aldosterone demonstrate the development of inflammation and fibrosis in both the myocardium and renal parenchyma. In limited human studies, aldosterone receptor antagonism is associated with decreased proteinuria and improved glomerular filtration rate. Although data support the addition of an aldosterone antagonist to conventional therapy when treating patients with chronic kidney disease, more studies are needed to determine the precise clinical indications and the appropriate safety monitoring.",

He had reduced his intake of food and water due to an intercurrent illness the days before admission. He was admitted to our coronary care unit due to bradycardia and hypotension. On arrival his blood pressure was 60/40 mm Hg, and he was in a cardiogenic shock. The electrocardiogram showed broad QRS-complexes and large T waves. Serum-potassium was 9.1 mmol/L and he had acute renal failure with oliguria, probably caused by reduced cardiac output due to hypovolemia combined with taking an ACE inhibitor and spironolactone. Haemodialysis was started and during dialysis QRS complexes became more narrow and heart rate and blood pressure normalized. The patient was discharged 10 days later with normal potassium and creatinine levels. Patients treated with ACE-inhibitors and spironolactone should be monitored closely. During intercurrent illness dehydration may occur and this can lead to renal failure and hyperkalemia which can be life-threatening. The condition should be recognized and addressed promptly, and if indicated haemodialysis should be performed.",

    "169": "Heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome manifested by signs and symptoms of low cardiac output, pulmonary, and/or systemic congestion. Immunologically, HF is defined as a state of immune activation and persistent inflammation, especially the circulatory levels of inflammatory cytokines have been found to increase. Traditional drugs used in HF have expressed immunomodulatory and/or anticytokine activities that may participate in their therapeutic efficacy in the disease. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors like captopril and enalapril as well as the angiotensin II receptor antagonist losartan indicated in HF exerted reducing effects on the inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 at experimental and clinical levels. Aldosterone antagonists like spironolactone when administered concomitantly with losartan can attenuate angiotensin II-enhanced cytokine production in HF. Carvedilol beta-adrenergic blockers showed a wider spectrum of anti-inflammatory/anticytokine activity that proved to be associated with improvement of cardiac function and ejection fraction in patients with HF. The poor prognosis in HF despite the long experience with its treatment necessitated thinking about new drugs to be added to the traditional ones. Methotrexate and statins are examples of these drugs, especially because they exert immunologic effects. A low dose of methotrexate has been considered as a hopeful adjunct therapy in chronic HF, but large long-term clinical trials are required. Statins showed conflicting results, although they might be useful early after acute ischemic events associated with left ventricular dysfunction or failure, especially in younger patients with less advanced HF.",

The aim of the study was to examine blood pressure (BP) and glucose levels in the Cohen-Rosenthal Diabetic Hypertensive (CRDH) model as well as to follow their weight preservation. CRDH rats (n=14) were fed the sugar-rich copper-free diet essential for the development of diabetes mellitus. Two months later BP and blood glucose levels were measured. CPSSA was diluted in drinking water and administered at a final dose of 53.5 mg/kg/d (n=8). Control rats (n=6) received no drug (vehicle group). In contrast to control group, CPSSA prevented progressive weight gain, without a detectable effect on food and water intake. CPSSA was effective in attenuating systolic and diastolic BP (P<0.01) as well as significantly reducing glucose levels (P<0.01). Control rats continued to gain weight, whereas the groups fed CPSSA did not. CPSSA was shown to have additional beneficial effects on improving BP and glucose level, as well as preserving weight gain. The authors conclude that the combined molecule CPSSA integrates the antihypertensive feature of both allicin and captopril, making it a potential antidiabetic and cardiovascular protective agent.",

The authors reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing telmisartan and valsartan for the management of essential hypertension in which the participants were followed for at least 6 weeks. When a metaanalysis was possible, included studies were analyzed by Review Manager 5.0 provided by Cochrane Collaboration Group. Statistics were calculated as weight mean differences (WMDs) and relative risk with a random-effect model. A total of 6 RCTs with 3762 patients were included in this metaanalysis. When the authors combined data from all treatment categories as a group, no difference was found between telmisartan and valsartan in reduction of systolic BP and diastolic BP. In subgroup analysis, telmisartan showed a significant benefit on lowering systolic BP and diastolic BP (WMD, -2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], -5.03 to -0.73; P<0.01; and WMD,-1.73; 95% CI, -2.47 to -0.98; P<0.01; respectively). It was found that telmisartan had a higher rate of management of clinical BP compared with valsartan (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.19; P=0.05). No difference was found in the incidence of adverse events. Telmisartan's BP-lowering capabilities were comparable to those of valsartan in monotherapy.

    "172": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) results in vasoconstriction, muscular (vascular and cardiac) hypertrophy and fibrosis. Established arterial stiffness and cardiac dysfunction are key factors contributing to subsequent cardiovascular and renal complications. Blockade of RAAS has been shown to be beneficial in patients with hypertension, acute myocardial infarction, chronic systolic heart failure, stroke and diabetic renal disease. An aggressive approach for more extensive RAAS blockade with combination of two commonly used RAAS blockers [ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)] yielded conflicting results in different patient populations. Combination therapy is also associated with more side effects, in particular hypotension, hyperkalaemia and renal impairment. Recently published ONTARGET study showed ACEI/ARB combination therapy was associated with more adverse effects without any increase in benefit. The Canadian Hypertension Education Program responded with a new warning: 'Do not use ACEI and ARB in combination'. However, the European Society of Cardiology in their updated heart failure treatment guidelines still recommended ACEI/ARB combo as a viable option. This apparent inconsistency among guidelines generates debate as to which approach of RAAS inhibition is the best. The current paper reviews the latest evidence of isolated ACEI or ARB use and their combination in cardiovascular diseases, and makes recommendations for their prescriptions in specific patient populations.",

Atherothrombotic comorbidities were also frequent: coronary artery disease in 44.9% and cerebrovascular disease in 28.1%. For confirmation of diagnosis, patients were referred to specialists in 66.9% of cases. Overall, ankle brachial index was measured in 89.0%, and a clinical PAD score assessed in 66.6% (agreement of both measures with Cohen's kappa only, kappa = 0.039; p = 0.209). Drug treatment of risk factors (as secondary prophylaxis) in line with current guidelines was reported in a high percentage of patients: 88.6% with any antiplatelet drug, 69.3% with statins, 62.4% with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 23.5% with AT(1) receptor blockers and 43.9% with beta-blockers. Between asymptomatic and symptomatic PAD, differences in the risk factor/comorbidity profiles were small; however, the latter group received intensified treatment.",

We used meta-analysis to evaluate CIMT changes and network meta-analysis to rank drugs according to the magnitude of these changes. We identified 31 randomized controlled trials listed in three databases as of January 2008. Using a random-effects model, we found a significant CIMT decrease with antihypertensive drugs compared to placebo (-0.10 [-0.16; -0.04]). Overall effect sizes vs. placebo were significant for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (-0.08 [-0.14; -0.02]), and a trend was found for beta-blockers (-0.09 [-0.19; 0.01]). The data did not allow other direct comparisons vs. placebo. Significant benefits were found for calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) compared to both ACE inhibitors (0.37 [0.20; 0.54]), as well as for angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) compared to beta-blockers (0.42 [0.29; 0.55]). Diuretics were less efficient than CCBs (-0.09 [-0.16; -0.02]). Indirect comparisons with network meta-analysis showed significant effects of CCBs and ARBs vs. placebo (both P < 0.05) and vs. diuretics (both P < 0.001). The CIMT decrease with ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers was greater than with diuretics (both P < 0.05) but was not different from the placebo effect. In subgroup analyses, significant benefits occurred with lower baseline CIMT values and shorter treatment durations but were unrelated to the size of the blood pressure decrease. In conclusion, among antihypertensive drugs, CCBs and ARBs have the greatest effect on CIMT.",

Approximately 200,000 individuals/year are treated with fractionated partial or whole-brain irradiation, and > half will survive long enough (\u22646 months) to develop radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment. Although short-term treatments have shown efficacy, no long-term treatments or preventive approaches are presently available for modulating radiation-induced brain injury. Based on previous preclinical studies clearly demonstrating that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers can modulate radiation-induced late effects in the kidney and lung, we and others hypothesized that RAS blockade would similarly modulate radiation-induced brain injury. Indeed, studies in the last 5 years have shown that both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT(1)RAs) can prevent/ameliorate radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment, in the rat. The mechanistic basis for this RAS blocker-mediated effect remains the subject of ongoing investigations. Putative mechanisms include, i] blockade of Ang II/NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and ii] a change in the balance of angiotensin (Ang) peptides from the pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidative Ang II to the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative Ang-1-7). However, given that both ACEIs and AT(1)RAs are 1] well-tolerated drugs routinely prescribed for hypertension, 2] exhibit some antitumor properties, and 3] can prevent/ameliorate radiation-induced brain injury, they appear to be ideal drugs for future clinical trials, offering the promise of improving the quality of life of brain tumor patients receiving brain irradiation.",

All hydrolysates showed greater fat absorption than the water-soluble fraction from undigested cuttlefish by-product proteins and casein. CPHs were also analysed for their ACE-inhibitory activity.

The reactions were investigated on-line using sequential injection analysis (SI) and the formed derivatives were monitored spectrophotometrically at 285 nm. The effect of critical parameters of the reaction such as the pH, the temperature and the amount concentration of the reagents were studied in detail including stopped-flow (SF) experiments. Both reagents were found to be suitable for the automated derivatization of thiols, although MP offered faster kinetics compared to BP.

    "207": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and hypertension. This short review examines clinical evidence for such effects and the underlying mechanism of action. One potential mode of action for ACE inhibitors in CAD is blood pressure reduction. However, recent data suggest that the effects of ACE inhibitors on the endothelium may also be relevant in attenuating the progression of atherosclerosis. In CAD, chronic overexpression of tissue ACE disrupts the angiotensin II/bradykinin balance with a net result of endothelial dysfunction, mainly due to an increased rate of apoptosis. An imbalance between endothelial apoptosis (death) and its renewal from the bone marrow (life) causes discontinuity of the endothelial layer, favoring the initiation and progression of a biochemical sequence that leads to atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, and eventually acute coronary syndromes. There is clinical and experimental evidence that ACE inhibition improves the life and death cycle of the endothelium. By restoring the bradykinin/angiotensin II balance, ACE inhibition reduces the rate of endothelial apoptosis and experimental results suggest that ACE inhibition can also improve the production and mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow. We report our experience in this context with perindopril.",

Heart mitochondria from SHR responded to hypertension with tendency to compensate the elevated energy demands of cardiac cells by moderate increase in mitochondrial Mg2+-ATPase activity, membrane fluidity (MF) and in majority of functional parameters of the mitochondria (p>0.05). Significant increase exhibited only the oxygen consumption (QO2; p<0.01-0.001) and oxidative phosphorylation rate (OPR; p<0.003) with glutamate+malate (GLUT+MAL) as substrates. Lowering the blood pressure (p<0.02) captopril also eliminated the above compensatory response and impaired the oxidative ATP production by decreasing OPR (p<0.001). Kidney mitochondria of SHR experienced serious disarrangement in parameters of oxidative ATP production: increase in Mg2+-ATPase activity (p<0.05) but, also scattered QO2 values (p<0.03-0.01) leading to decrease in OPR and the ADP:O (p<0.05-0.01) values with both GLUT+MAL and succinate as substrates.

Recent clinical trials suggest that the approach of using monotherapy for the control of hypertension is not likely to be successful in most patients. Combination therapy may be theoretically favored by the fact that multiple factors contribute to hypertension, and achieving control of blood pressure with single agent acting through one particular mechanism may not be possible. Regimens can either be fixed dose combinations or drugs added sequentially one after other. Combining the drugs makes them available in a convenient dosing format, lower the dose of individual component, thus, reducing the side effects and improving compliance. Classes of antihypertensive agents which have been commonly used are angiotensin receptor blockers, thiazide diuretics, beta and alpha blockers, calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are effective, as well as combinations that include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, in reducing BP. The majority of currently available fixed-dose combinations are diuretic-based. Combinations may be individualized according to the presence of comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, heart failure, thyroid disorders and for special population groups like elderly and pregnant females.",

A substantial body of evidence exists evaluating various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods to decrease the occurrence of POAF in an effort to decrease its burden on the health care system. Evidence-based guidelines support the use of beta-blockers as standard prophylaxis of POAF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Traditional prophylactic therapy for POAF targets the sympathetic nervous system, refractory period, and atrial conduction. However, associations between the development of POAF and the inflammatory process, oxidative stress, and atrial remodeling have prompted the investigation of novel therapies targeting these processes. To evaluate the role of pharmacologic strategies beyond beta-blockers in the prevention of POAF, we conducted a search of the PubMed database to identify studies published from 1950-February 2009. Emphasis was placed on how these therapies could be used in patients intolerant to beta-blockers or as additive therapy in high-risk patients. We found that sufficient evidence exists to recommend the use of amiodarone, sotalol, and possibly magnesium as monotherapy in patients unable to take beta-blockers or as add-on therapy for the prevention of POAF. Currently, available evidence does not support the use of propafenone, procainamide, digoxin, thiazolidinediones, triiodothyronine, or calcium channel blockers in the prevention of POAF. Preliminary evidence suggests that dofetilide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, omega-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and sodium nitroprusside may be effective in preventing POAF.

Significant and clinically meaningful treatment-time differences in the beneficial and/or adverse effects of at least six different classes of hypertension medications are now known. Generally, calcium channel blockers are more effective with bedtime than morning dosing, and in the case of dihydropyridine derivatives bedtime dosing significantly reduces the risk of edema. Scheduling angiotensin II receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at bedtime, as opposed to awakening, increases the proportion of patients with properly controlled BP, enhances the sleep-time relative BP decline towards a normal dipping pattern and best reduces urinary albumin excretion, a marker of functional renal status. The chronotherapy of conventional BP-lowering medications entails their correct scheduling with reference to the body's circadian rhythms, not only to achieve control of daytime and night-time systolic and diastolic BP but to normalize the dipping status of the 24 h pattern. Chronotherapy constitutes a cost-effective strategy for enhancing BP control during both nocturnal sleep and daytime activity and for potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and end-organ injury of the blood vessels and tissue of the heart, brain, kidney, eye and other organs.",

Previous data regarding changes in capillary density and angiogenesis during ACE inhibition are controversial. The aim of the following study was to determine myocardial microcirculation and heart function in the rat after coronary stenosis using non invasive MR imaging techniques. MR spin labeling and cine techniques have been performed in female Wistar rats 2weeks after coronary artery stenosis. In one group, animals were treated with quinapril in a dose of 6mg/kg/day. Perfusion, relative blood volume (RBV), LV mass and function were determined non-invasively 2weeks after treatment. Finally, fibrosis and capillary density were analyzed histologically. Additionally, hemodynamic measurements were realized in a further group in order to calculate systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Quinapril resulted in a significant increase in perfusion at rest in the remote and the poststenotic myocardium with improved systolic function and a decrease in SVR compared to the non treated control group. Additionally, maximum perfusion and RBV were slightly elevated whereas capillary density was unchanged among the groups. MRI allows for non-invasive quantification of functional microcirculation and heart function. In addition to the well known effect of ACE inhibition on systolic function, treatment with the tissue specific ACE inhibitor quinapril revealed an important microvascular improvement, especially at arteriolar level.

In patients with Child Pugh A cirrhosis, the HVPG reduction with ARB/ACEi (-17%; 95% CI: -28 to -6), was similar to that of BB (-21%; 95% CI: -32 to -9).

In multivariate analysis, advanced age, lower systolic blood pressure, higher Killip class at admission, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, higher blood creatinine level, lower total cholesterol levels, and coronary artery bypass grafting during hospitalization were independently associated with less use of optimal evidence-based medical therapy.

Data about reimbursed prescriptions of beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE/ARBs) and statins for these patients was obtained from the database of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund. Data were mainly analysed using frequency tables and, where appropriate, the Pearson's chi2 test, the Mann-Whitney U-test and the t-test were used. A logistic regression method was used to investigate the relationship between drug allocation and age and gender.

Median daily dosages differed significantly between men and women in the age group 60-79 years for BBs and ACE/ARBs, respectively. Various combinations of the drugs studied were not allocated in equal proportions for men and women, although the same combinations were the most frequently used for both genders. The logistic regression analysis adjusted to gender and age revealed that some combinations of drugs were not allocated similarly in different age and gender groups.",

    "254": "The cardiovascular and cardiorenal disease continuum comprises the transition from cardiovascular risk factors to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, to clinical complications such as myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, to the development of persistent target-organ damage and, ultimately, to chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), end-stage renal disease or premature death. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is involved in all steps along this pathway, and RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin AT(1)-receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers; ARBs) has turned out to be beneficial for patient outcomes throughout the disease continuum. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs can prevent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. These drugs have further been shown to reduce end-organ damage in the heart, kidneys and brain. Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone and eplerenone are increasingly recognized as a third class of RAAS inhibitor with potent risk-reducing properties, especially but not solely with respect to the inhibition of cardiac remodelling and the possible prevention of heart failure. In secondary prevention, head-to-head comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, such as the recent ONTARGET study, provided evidence that, in addition to better tolerability, ARBs are non-inferior to ACE inhibitors in the prevention of clinical endpoints such as MI and stroke in cardiovascular high-risk patients. However, the combination of both ramipril and telmisartan at the maximally tolerated dosage achieved no further benefits and was associated with more adverse events such as symptomatic hypotension and renal dysfunction. In acute MI complicated by heart failure, the VALIANT trial has shown similar effects of ACE inhibition with captopril and ARB treatment with valsartan, but dual RAAS blockade did not further reduce events. In CHF, meta-analyses of RESOLVD, ValHeFT and CHARM-ADDED have shown that combined RAAS inhibition with an ACE inhibitor and ARB significantly reduced the morbidity endpoint in certain patient subgroups compared with standard therapy. However, in clinical practice, dual RAAS blockade is rarely employed, as seen, for instance, in the CORONA trial. The RALES and EPHESUS trials, investigating the effects of aldosterone blockade on cardiovascular outcomes in CHF patients, revealed that the addition of an aldosterone antagonist to standard heart failure therapy conferred powerful relative risk reductions for both morbidity and mortality. Future studies will elucidate whether this also holds true for patients who are asymptomatic or who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In selected patients with renal disease, several studies have suggested that combined RAAS blockade brings about additional renoprotective antiproteinuric effects independent of blood pressure reduction, and large trials with robust endpoints are underway. In summary, combined therapy with several RAAS inhibitors is not recommended for all patients along the cardiorenovascular continuum. Patients with CHF with incomplete neuroendocrine blockade, as indicated, for example, by repetitive cardiac decompensation or refractory symptoms, might benefit from dual therapy as long as safety issues are well controlled. Finally, novel pharmacological agents such as the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren may provide additional therapeutic tools, but their role has yet to be established.", 
    "255": "Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic margin and potentially life-threatening cardiac adverse effects. Gastrointestinal disorders, neuropsychological disorders and bradycardia are warning signs. Some drug combinations can aggravate the cardiac adverse effects of digoxin, or reduce its efficacy. We reviewed the literature, using the standard Prescrire methodology, in order to examine which drugs are involved in these interactions, and the mechanisms involved. Most relevant data are based on small pharmacokinetic studies or detailed case reports. The adverse effects of digoxin are potentiated by renal impairment, which may be pre-existing or due to nephrotoxic drugs such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and ciclosporin. Some coadministered drugs such as macrolides and cardiovascular drugs (especially amiodarone) can cause digoxin overdose through pharmacokinetic interactions. The mechanism most often implicated is inhibition of P-glycoprotein, of which digoxin is a substrate. Hypercalcaemia and hypokalaemia inducing drugs, heart-rate lowering drugs, and drugs that prolong the QT interval or slow cardiac conduction can potentiate the cardiac adverse effects of digoxin. Plasma concentration of digoxin is not affected. Several drugs, including sucralfate, acarbose, cytotoxic agents, and enzyme inducers, can reduce digoxin plasma concentrations. This effect is attributed to decreased gastrointestinal absorption or increased elimination of digoxin. In practice, patients treated with digoxin, and their caregivers, should be aware that digoxin has a narrow therapeutic margin and frequent and potentially severe adverse effects. Close clinical monitoring is necessary to detect early warning signs (bradycardia and gastrointestinal or neurological disorders). Digoxin assay alone is not always sufficient. Special care is required for patients with renal failure, the elderly and patients receiving potentially interacting drugs.", 
    "256": "Despite the existence of established, effective therapies for hypertension, new methods of blood pressure and cardiovascular risk reduction are still needed. Novel approaches are targeted towards treating resistant hypertension, improving blood-pressure control, and achieving further risk reduction beyond blood-pressure lowering. Modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) provides the rationale for current antihypertensive therapies, including the relatively new agents eplerenone and aliskiren. Novel targets for antihypertensive therapy are also likely to be RAAS-related. The stimulation of angiotensin II type 2 receptors, or supplementation with renalase, could counteract the effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor stimulation or catecholamine release. Combined angiotensin-converting-enzyme and neutral endopeptidase blockade decreases blood pressure, but is associated with a high incidence of angioedema. Aldosterone synthase inhibitors might improve tolerability in aldosterone antagonism. A (pro)renin-receptor blocker could prevent the deleterious angiotensin-independent actions of renin that are not inhibited by aliskiren. Finally, new minimally invasive surgical procedures have revived the concept of renal denervation, and could be a therapeutic option for patients with resistant hypertension. All of these strategies are exciting prospects, but which of them will prove valuable in clinical setting remains to be discovered.", 
    "257": "The present study evaluated the radical scavenging and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of cold and hot aqueous extracts of Ficus racemosa (Moraceae) stem bark. The extracts were standardized using HPLC. Radical scavenging activity was determined using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity using rabbit lung and partially purified porcine kidney ACE. HPLC profiles of cold aqueous extract (FRC) showed the presence of bergenin, an isocoumarin, while hot aqueous extract (FRH) was found to contain ferulic acid, kaempferol and coumarin in addition to bergenin. FRH showed significantly higher (p \u2264 0.01) radical scavenging activity than FRC and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), consequently resulting in a significantly lower (p \u2264 0.01) IC\u2085\u2080 value than FRC and BHT. Both the extracts exhibited a dose dependent inhibition of porcine kidney and rabbit lung ACE. FRH showed significantly higher (p \u2264 0.01) activity than FRC with lower IC(50) values of 1.36 and 1.91 \u03bcg/mL respectively, for porcine kidney and rabbit lung ACE, compared with those of FRC (128 and 291 \u03bcg/mL). Further, a significant correlation (r = 0.893; p \u2264 0.05) was observed between radical scavenging activity and ACE-inhibitory activity. This is the first report on the ACE-inhibitory activity of F. racemosa stem bark suggesting its potential to be utilized as a therapeutic alternative for hypertension.",

The aim of this work was to study a group of hypertensive patients without skin diseases treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors (I), to verify the presence of serum circulating anti-antibodies. The indirect immunofluorescence showed that 33 sera (52.38%) presented autoantibodies directed to an antigen of the cytoplasm of the superficial epidermal keratinocytes. Two of the 33 positive sera had antibodies to Dsg1 and/or 3 in ELISA. Immunoblot analyses were negative. All the 48 control sera were found to have no circulating antibodies using the three assays.

It affects ~2.3 million individuals in the United States, and the prevalence is expected to increase ~2.5-fold over the next 40 years. Atrial fibrillation accounts for more than 2 million hospitalizations each year and contributes to nearly 67 000 deaths. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of AF has increased dramatically over the past few decades. Recent treatment guidelines have heightened our awareness of the challenges involved in the treatment of AF and provided useful recommendations for its diagnosis and management. Because AF is usually associated with multiple comorbid conditions, greater emphasis must be placed on individualizing treatment. This review focuses on current treatment guidelines for patients with AF, assessing the benefits and shortcomings of current pharmacologic options and discussing new agents and trials that may provide better opportunities to improve and individualize patient management.", 
    "260": "The novel peptide, angiotensin (ANG)-(1-12), elicits a systemic pressor response and vasoconstriction. These effects are blocked by ANG converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or AT(1) receptor antagonists, suggesting a role as an ANG II precursor. However, ANG-(1-12) can serve as a substrate for either ANG II or ANG-(1-7) formation, depending on the local tissue enzymes. Although levels of ANG-(1-12) are higher than ANG I or ANG II in brain, the role and processing of this peptide for autonomic control of heart rate (HR) has yet to be considered. Thus we examined the effects of nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) microinjection of ANG-(1-12) on baroreflex sensitivity for control of HR, resting arterial pressure (AP) and HR, and indexes of sympathovagal balance in urethane/chloralose anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. NTS injection of ANG-(1-12) (144 fmol/120 nl) significantly impaired the evoked baroreflex sensitivity to increases in AP [n = 7; 1.06 +/- 0.06 baseline vs. 0.44 +/- 0.07 ms/mmHg after ANG-(1-12)], reduced the vagal component of spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity and HR variability, and elicited a transient depressor response (P < 0.05). NTS pretreatment with an AT(1) receptor antagonist or ACE inhibitor prevented ANG-(1-12)-mediated autonomic and depressor responses. ANG-(1-12) immunostaining was observed in cells within the NTS of Sprague-Dawley rats, providing a potential intracellular source for the peptide. However, acute NTS injection of an ANG-(1-12) antibody did not alter resting baroreflex sensitivity, AP, or HR in these animals. Collectively, these findings suggest that exogenous ANG-(1-12) is processed to ANG II for cardiovascular actions at AT(1) receptors within the NTS. The lack of acute endogenous ANG-(1-12) tone for cardiovascular regulation in Sprague-Dawley rats contrasts with chronic immunoneutralization in hypertensive rats, suggesting that ANG-(1-12) may be activated only under hypertensive conditions.",

The protein has two disulfide linked subunits: acidic and basic. Acidic subunit has the potential as a functional and nutraceutical protein, and it is structurally a good candidate for modification. In order to improve its functionality, the primary structure was modified in the third variable region of globulins 11S, by inserting four Val-Tyr antihypertensive peptides in tandem. The designed plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli Origami (DE3) and then the expressed protein was purified. Mass spectrometry analysis was used to corroborate the identity of the protein by peptide mass fingerprinting; also, the modified peptide was fragmented and sequenced by mass spectrometry, corroborating thus the inserted residues. The hydrolyzed protein showed a high inhibitory activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (IC(50) 0.064 mg ml(-1)); it was nearly eightfold more active than the nonmodified protein. In spite that the nonmodified subunit is less active, its activity is comparable with other hydrolyzed proteins reported as high active inhibitors. The expressed and purified subunit after its engineered modification, may be useful for preventing hypertension and for other medical purposes.",

ACE2 is considered an endogenous regulator of the vasoconstrictive, proliferative, fibrotic, and proinflammatory effects of the ACE-Ang II-angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) axis. Both animal and clinical studies have emerged to define a role for ACE2 in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). There is scientific evidence supporting the concept that ACE2 maintains the RAS balance and plays a protective role in PAH. The activation of pulmonary ACE2 could influence the pathogenesis of PAH and serve as a novel therapeutic target in PAH.

Thus, more research that establishes the novel therapeutic potential and defines the mechanism of the ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas counterregulatory axis in PAH is needed.", 
    "284": "We studied the effect of perindopril (1%) on intraocular pressure (IOP) and compared it with the effect of pilocarpine, a therapeutic agent used in experimentally induced acute and chronic models of glaucoma in rabbits. Acute glaucoma was induced by intravenous administration of 5% glucose. Pretreatment with topical perindopril (1%) and pilocarpine (1%) prevented acute rise in IOP induced by intravenous administration of 5% glucose. For inducing chronic ocular hypertension in rabbits, 50 units of freshly prepared alpha-chymotrypsin in 0.1 mL of sterile saline was injected in the posterior chamber of the eye. Perindopril (1%) (35 +/- 1.38 mm Hg to 22.45 +/- 1.42 mm Hg) and pilocarpine (1%) (34.4 +/- 0.81 mm Hg to 20.15 +/- 0.69 mm Hg) produced a significant fall in IOP in these rabbits; pretreatment with indomethacin (prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor) did not affect the IOP-lowering action of perindopril (1%). Perindopril (2.71 x 10(-7) mol/L) and neostigmine (1.49 x 10(-7) mol/L) inhibited true cholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase enzyme activity in blood. The cholinesterase enzyme inhibition by perindopril was comparable with that by neostigmine. In conclusion, our data suggest that perindopril reduced IOP in experimentally induced acute and chronic glaucoma in rabbits. One of the possible mechanisms of perindopril, apart from the inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme, may be inhibition of the enzyme cholinesterase.", 
    "285": "Heart rate turbulence (HRT) denotes the baroreflex-mediated short-term oscillation of cardiac cycle lengths after spontaneous ventricular premature complexes. The physiological pattern of HRT consists of brief heart rate acceleration followed by more gradual heart rate deceleration before the heart rate returns to baseline. Physiological mechanisms of HRT are complex and require an intact interplay between both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The strong and independent prognostic value of HRT in identifying postinfarction patients at high risk for death has been validated in six retrospective and three prospective studies together enrolling more than 8000 patients. This evidence qualifies HRT as a promising tool for selection of patients who might benefit from implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator. Moreover, HRT predicts poor outcome in patients with heart failure. It is not only correlated with a patient's clinical status, but also recovers when heart failure treatment, including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or cardiac resynchronization therapy, is effective. Therefore, HRT might also be used as a treatment target to guide pharmacotherapy of heart failure.", 
    "286": "We tested the hypothesis that meat is a source of peptides that are effective at preventing and reducing chronic lifestyle-related diseases (CLSRDs) such as hypertension. This analysis reflects the importance of empowering hypertensive people in quality versus quantity of life issues, and in offering nutritional treatment options rather than medical alternatives. For both hypertensive and normotensive individuals, chemically based medications may have harmful side effects. Functional food rich in antioxidant vitamins, and proteins or biologically active peptides, can lower blood pressure in persons with essential hypertension, possibly by preventing an underlying cause of the condition. Deficiency in consumption of crucial nutrients such as proteins from meat origins, along with abnormalities in carbohydrate and fat metabolism, may underlie the etiology of the clinical course of hypertension. Food derived from meat rich in nutrients may provide physiologically functional peptides, as well as improve digestion, and the metabolism of carbohydrate and fats, thus lowering blood pressure, and normalizing associated biochemical and histopathological changes. Meat was found to have value, because proteolysis of meat muscle generated a substantial number of multi-amino acid peptides that have nutrafunctional roles, and some of which have strong angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitory activity. This also demonstrates that meat proteins might lead to better nutraceutical therapy that minimizes health problems, and might aid in finding the most effective approaches for meeting the needs of all hypertension patients.",

Femoral plaque vulnerability did not differ between RA and controls. The presence of RA was found to be an independent predictor of increased femoral IMT (p=0.004), after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, C-reactive protein and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and statins.

As a common catalyst of both diseases, inflammation is the likely cause of increased prevalence of CVD in the RA population. Abating disease-related inflammation in RA may be an effective strategy in reducing CVD risk. Several other therapies used to modify cardiovascular risk factors in the general population such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are under investigation in patients with RA. This review discusses the parallels in the pathology of RA and atherosclerosis and discusses current therapies for RA and how they affect cardiovascular risk.", 
    "293": "In a clinical trial with two clinically important endpoints, each of which can fully characterize a treatment benefit to support an efficacy claim by itself, a minimum degree of consistency in the findings is expected; otherwise interpretation of study findings can be problematic. Clinical trial literature contains examples where lack of consistency in the findings of clinically relevant endpoints led to difficulties in interpreting study results. The aim of this paper is to introduce this consistency concept at the study design stage and investigate the consequences of its implementation in the statistical analysis plan. The proposed methodology allows testing of hierarchically ordered endpoints to proceed as long as a pre-specified consistency criterion is met. In addition, while an initial allocation of the alpha level is specified for the ordered endpoints at the design stage, the methodology allows the alpha level allocated to the second endpoint to be adaptive to the findings of the first endpoint. In addition, the methodology takes into account the correlation between the endpoints in calculating the significance level and the power of the test for the next endpoint. The proposed Consistency-Adjusted Alpha-Adaptive Strategy (CAAAS) is very general. Several of the well-known multiplicity adjustment approaches arise as special cases of this strategy by appropriate selection of the consistency level and the form of alpha-adaptation function. We discuss control of the Type I error rate as well as power of the proposed methodology and consider its application to clinical trial data.",

The aim of this study was to determine if there were added renoprotective benefits seen by combining ACEi with blockade of NADPH oxidase.",

    "296": "All three treatments retarded the development of albuminuria in the diabetic rats. Apocynin conferred its benefit either as a monotherapy or in combination with ramipril without affecting blood pressure per se. Renal morphological injury was attenuated by all three treatment strategies. Diabetes was associated with increasing renal fibronectin and type IV collagen protein expression, with the combination regimen resulting in the highest decrease in extracellular matrix accumulation. All three treatments prevented the diabetes-associated increases in renal cytosolic superoxide generation as well as urinary isoprostanes. While renal TGF-beta1 activation was reduced by ramipril treatment but not by apocynin as a monotherapy, kidney cortical membranous VEGF was reduced by apocynin as monotherapy and dual therapy but not by ramipril alone.",

    "298": "Malonyl coenzyme A (CoA) decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.9, MCD) deficiency, or malonic aciduria, is a rare inborn error of metabolism characterised by a variable phenotype of developmental delay, seizures, cardiomyopathy and acidosis. There is no consensus for dietary treatment in this condition. This case describes the effect of a long-chain triglyceride (LCT)-restricted/medium-chain triglyceride (MCT)-supplemented diet upon the progress of an affected child. A full-term Asian girl of birth weight 3590 g was screened for malonic aciduria after birth due to a positive family history. She had elevated urine malonic and methylmalonic acids and was presumably homozygous for a deleterious mutation in the MLYCD gene. Her echocardiography showed mild cardiomyopathy at 0.5 months of age, but heart function was good. She was treated with carnitine 100 mg/kg per day and continued a high-energy formula feed, as her growth was slow. At 3 months of age, echocardiography showed deteriorating cardiac function with a fractional shortening of 18%. She started an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Captopril). Over the next few months, her diet was altered to comprise 1.9% energy from LCT, 25% from MCT and the remainder carbohydrate. Cardiac function improved and was optimal at 23 months of age, with a fractional shortening of 28% and good systolic function. During a period of low MCT intake, her cardiac function was noted to deteriorate. This reversed and stabilised following reinstatement of the diet. This case of malonic aciduria with cardiomyopathy demonstrates improvement in cardiac function attributable to LCT-restricted/MCT-supplemented diet.", 
    "299": "The role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of chronic age-related diseases is increasingly recognized, and inflammation could represent the common pathway linking diseases and disability. Thus, targeting inflammation could represent a useful strategy at preventing or delaying functional decline. In this paper we review recent evidence suggesting that selected drugs, such as statins, fibrates, angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, and physical exercise may be able to contrast functional decline by blunting inflammation. Results from randomized trials investigating the effects of physical activity programs on inflammation and functional decline is still limited, and further investigations are warranted.", 
    "300": "Heart failure with normal ejection fraction (HFNEF) is a complex syndrome that has been broadly studied since the last decade. It is caused by diastolic ventricular dysfunction demonstrated by complementary methods, such as hemodynamic study or echocardiogram, in the presence of a normal ejection fraction (EF). It affects primarily elderly individuals with comorbidities, such as systemic arterial hypertension, coronary failure and obesity. The physiopathological mechanisms are complex and multifactorial, involving the myocardial passive stiffness, the ventricular geometry, the pericardial restraint and the interaction between the ventricles. The main objectives of the treatment were to decrease the pulmonary venous congestion and the heart rate and control the comorbidities. There is no strong evidence that the use of specific medications, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers can influence mortality. The poorer prognostic factors include advanced age, presence of kidney dysfunction, diabetes, functional class III and IV (NYHA) and advanced-stage diastolic dysfunction, with a restrictive pattern of ventricular filling. Another aspect that has been increasingly cited in the literature is the analysis of the role of the systolic function in HFNEF cases. All these aspects are analyzed in detail in the present review.", 
    "301": "In Part 1 of this review, we discussed how plaque rupture is the most common underlying cause of most cases of unstable angina/non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) and how early risk stratification is vital for the timely diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Now, in Part 2, we focus on the medical therapies and treatment strategies (early conservative vs early invasive) used for UA/NSTEMI. We also discuss results from various large randomized controlled trials that have led to the contemporary standards of practice for, and reduced morbidity and death from, UA/NSTEMI. In summary, ACS involving UA/NSTEMI is associated with high rates of adverse cardiovascular events, despite recent therapeutic advances. Plaque composition and inflammation are more important in the pathogenesis of ACS than is the actual degree of arterial stenosis. As results from new trials challenge our current practices and help us develop the optimal treatment strategy for UA/NSTEMI patients, the cornerstones of contemporary treatment remain early risk stratification and aggressive medical therapy, supplemented by coronary angiography in appropriately selected patients. An early-invasive-treatment strategy is of most benefit to high-risk patients, whereas an early-conservative strategy is recommended for low-risk patients. Adjunctive medical therapy with acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel or another adenosine diphosphate antagonist, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, and either low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin, in the appropriate setting, further reduces the risk of ischemic events secondary to thrombosis. Short- and long-term inhibition of platelet aggregation should be achieved by appropriately evaluating the risk of bleeding complications in these patients.", 
    "302": "Endovascular procedures may play a role in renal artery stenosis (RAS) treatment in attempt to preserve renal function and improve hypertension control. We determined renal outcome and the incidence of restenosis in patients with RAS treated with renal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (RPTAs) and medical therapy versus patients with RAS treated only with medical therapy. We performed an observational study based on 93 patients with RAS. In all, 53 patients underwent RPTAs in association with medical therapy and 40 patients were only treated pharmacologically. In patients receiving RPTAs, a better renal outcome, a decrease of restenosis rate, and systolic-diastolic blood pressure were associated with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) + angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-is) therapy. In patients treated with medical therapy alone, renal improvement was related to ARBs in association with BBs (\u03b2-blockers; P < .0001). This study suggests that medical therapy may exert beneficial effects in patients with RAS.", 
    "303": "To identify biological pathways associated with myocardial recovery from heart failure (HF), gene profiling and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were examined in left ventricle of spontaneously hypertensive rats with HF (SHR-F) with no treatment, following treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and treatment with captopril combined with the short chain fatty acid derivative phenylbutyrate. Failing hearts demonstrated depressed left ventricular ejection fraction, while ventricular volume and mass increased. Captopril treatment alone prevented further deterioration but did not improve myocardial function; relatively few transcripts were differentially expressed relative to untreated SHR-F. Gene sets identified by GSEA as downregulated with captopril treatment compared to SHR-F group included those related to hypoxia and reactive oxygen species, while upregulated gene sets included G protein signaling. Treatment with phenylbutyrate alone did not improve survival (no animals in this group survived the 30 day treatment period), while phenylbutyrate combined with captopril increased survival and significantly improved cardiac function in vivo and in vitro. Normalized microarray data identified 780 genes that demonstrated a combined treatment effect of which 258 genes were modified with HF. Fatty acid metabolism and ion transport were among the most significantly upregulated pathways in the combined treatment group compared to untreated SHR with HF, whereas those related to oxidative stress, growth, inflammation, protein degradation, and TGF-beta signaling were downregulated. These findings demonstrate improved myocardial function and regression of cardiac hypertrophy, and identify many HF related gene sets altered with phenylbutyrate and captopril treatment, but not captopril alone. These results characterize gene sets associated with recovery from HF, and suggest that phenylbutyrate may be a potentially effective adjunctive treatment, together with captopril, by synergistically modulating pathways that contribute to restoration of contractile function of the failing SHR heart.",

In this assessment, the overall view of the patient-relevant results was that diuretics can be used as first-line antihypertensive treatment. Diabetes incidence is highest with diuretics, but minimal differences in fasting plasma glucose of approximately 0.28 mmol/l are magnified by the transformation of continuous blood glucose values into categorical data: with the establishment of thresholds, the diagnosis of diabetes depends on being above a certain blood glucose value. The protective cardiovascular effects of diuretics do not seem to be reduced in hypertensive patients who develop new-onset diabetes during treatment. Since blood pressure control is often worse, detection, treatment and control should be urgently improved. The debate on antihypertensive agents is mainly of scientific interest and has only minor clinical relevance for everyday patient care.",

Early recognition and treatment, based on total cardiovascular risk assessment, is crucial for cardiovascular and renal protection.

Initiation of treatment wih combination of antihypertensive drugs is reasonable choice especially in high or very high risk patients where it is important to achieve prompt and intensive blood pressure control in order to reduce cardiovascular complications. Fixed combination of two antihypertensive drugs can simplify treatment and favour compliance. The last, 2007 ESH/ESC guidelines, and several studies published in the meantime, favour use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers with calcium channel blockers or diuretics as the combination of choice.

Most older patients with CKD have nonproteinuric nondiabetic CKD, thus differing from participants in trials which examined renal outcomes, which often included only patients with diabetes or proteinuria.

The present investigation is a retrospective case-control study. A total of 340 participants were analyzed, including 162 patients and 178 healthy controls. Hypertension and smoking showed a significant association with thrombotic disease (p < 0.05) but FG level was found significant risk factor only for the venous thrombosis (VT) group (p < 0.04). Significant differences between thrombotic groups were found for the studied polymorphisms of PAI-1 (p < 0.0014), but for both FG beta-chain gene polymorphisms, none of the molecular analyses showed a positive sample for any mutating allele (p > 0.05).

Our goal was to evaluate the effect of a commonly used calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, lisinopril on urinary albumin excretion in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. We screened 324 patients with essential hypertension for microalbuminuria and documented it in 120 patients. These 120 patients with microalbuminuria were randomly divided into two groups of 60 each, matched for age, sex, arterial pressure, creatinine clearance, and urinary albumin excretion so as to receive amlodipine or lisinopril. We prospectively measured their urinary albumin excretion and creatinine clearance prior to treatment and, four and eight weeks after treatment with amlodipine or lisinopril.

The aim of this study was to estimate the efficacy and tolerability of trandolapril/verapamil (Tr/Ve) combination for blood pressure control and renoprotection. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the criteria was performed. Twelve RCTs were ultimately included out of 62 studies. (1) Combination versus trandolapril: a greater diastolic blood pressure (DBP) reduction (weighted mean difference (WMD): 3.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.84-5.57); a greater reduction in albuminuria (WMD: 136.77, 95% CI: 12.44-261.09). There were no differences in reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP), blood pressure response rate or proteinuria. (2) Combination versus verapamil: a greater SBP reduction (WMD: 6.14, 95% CI: 3.59-8.70); a greater DBP reduction (WMD: 2.49, 95% CI: 0.81-4.17); a greater reduction in proteinuria (standardized mean difference: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.22-1.45); a greater reduction in albuminuria (WMD: 255.00, 95% CI: 119.26-390.74). (3) Incidence of all-cause adverse events (AEs) was comparable between combination and monotherapy. The present meta-analysis indicates that Tr/Ve combination provides a superior blood pressure control and a favourable renoprotective effect without an increase of overall AEs than verapamil monotherapy. The combination also shows a slight advantage over trandolapril monotherapy by reducing DBP and albuminuria to a greater extent.", 
    "351": "Blood flow reduction induces inward remodeling of resistance arteries (RAs). This remodeling occurs in ischemic diseases, diabetes and hypertension. Nonetheless, the effect of flow reduction per se, independent of the effect of pressure or metabolic influences, is not well understood in RA. As angiotensin II is involved in the response to flow in RA, we hypothesized that angiotensin II may also be involved in the remodeling induced by a chronic flow reduction. We analyzed the effect of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition (perindopril) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade (candesartan) on inward remodeling induced by blood flow reduction in vivo in rat mesenteric RAs (low flow (LF) arteries). After 1 week, diameter reduction in LF arteries was associated with reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation and lower levels of eNOS expression. Superoxide production and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2 phosphorylation were higher in LF than in normal flow arteries. Nevertheless, the absence of eNOS or superoxide level reduction (tempol or apocynin) did not prevent LF remodeling. Perindopril and candesartan prevented inward remodeling in LF arteries. Contractility to angiotensin II was reduced in LF vessels by perindopril, candesartan and the ERK1/2 blocker PD98059. ERK1/2 activation (ratio phospho-ERK/ERK) was higher in LF arteries, and this activation was prevented by perindopril and candesartan. ERK1/2 inhibition in vivo (U0126) prevented LF-induced diameter reduction. Thus, inward remodeling because of blood flow reduction in mesenteric RA depends on unopposed angiotensin II-induced contraction and ERK1/2 activation, independent of superoxide production. These findings might be of importance in the treatment of vascular disorders.",

Epilepsies are chronic neurological disorders characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures that affect 1-3% of the world's population, and the most commonly used anticonvulsants are described to be effective in approx. 70% of the population with this neurological alteration. Using a rat model of epilepsy, we found that components of the RAS, namely ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) and the AT1 receptor (angiotensin II type 1 receptor) are up-regulated in the brain (2.6- and 8.2-fold respectively) following repetitive seizures. Subsequently, epileptic animals were treated with clinically used doses of enalapril, an ACE inhibitor, and losartan, an AT1 receptor blocker, leading to a significant decrease in seizure severities. These results suggest that centrally acting drugs that target the RAS deserve further investigation as possible anticonvulsant agents and may represent an additional strategy in the management of epileptic patients.",

It is concluded that dual RAAS blockade should not be routinely applied to patients with low or moderate risk of progressive kidney disease (normoalbuminuria or microalbuminuria with preserved glomerular filtration rate).

We assessed the ability of poststroke captopril treatment to retard death and restore CBF autoregulation in SHRsp. Laser Doppler techniques were used to measure alterations in CBF with varying mean arterial pressure (MAP) in anesthetized SHRsp. Three weeks before stroke, all SHRsp autoregulated near constant CBF to an upper MAP limit of 155 +/- 4 mm Hg. CBF autoregulation was absent in half of the SHRsp at 0.5-2 weeks before stroke and nonexistent in SHRsp with stroke. Captopril treatment (50 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) initiated at the first signs of stroke (seizures) increased the lifespan of SHRsp from 10 +/- 3 to 124 +/- 18 days without lowering blood pressure and restored CBF autoregulation within 10 days. CBF autoregulation subsequently deteriorated where after 25 days of treatment, only 2 of 5 SHRsp maintained the ability to autoregulate CBF. We concluded that captopril treatment retarded death and new hemorrhage formation after stroke. The early restoration of autoregulation could prevent sudden death after stroke, but other mechanisms associated with poststroke captopril treatment act to prolong life in the presence of hypertension and absence of CBF autoregulation.",

Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which interrupt RAAS overactivity by blocking a specific receptor that mediates the pathogenic activity of angiotensin II, represent a major addition to the clinician's armamentarium for the management of hypertension. A solid body of clinical evidence demonstrates that ARBs are effective in the management of hypertension as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Although comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other major classes of antihypertensive agents in the treatment of hypertension, the favorable tolerability profile of ARBs make them an attractive alternative for many patients. Recent evidence suggests that treatment persistence with ARB therapy during a 12-month period is typically higher than with other antihypertensive classes, a finding perhaps driven by fewer treatment-limiting side effects. The combination of clinical efficacy and tolerability should render ARBs as a major treatment alternative for hypertension.",

It has been proposed that this effect may be a consequence of a short half-life and duration of action. However, those findings were also documented for long-acting medications, such as the ARB telmisartan. Accordingly, we investigated the administration-time-dependent effects on ambulatory BP of spirapril, an ACEI with an elimination half-life of about 40 h. We studied 165 previously untreated hypertensive subjects, 42.5 +/- 13.9 yrs of age, treated with spirapril (6 mg/day) as monotherapy for 12 weeks either upon awakening or at bedtime. BP was measured by ambulatory monitoring for 48 h before and after treatment. The BP reduction during diurnal activity was similar for both treatment times. Bedtime spirapril administration, however, was significantly more efficient than morning administration in reducing asleep BP. The awake/asleep BP ratio was decreased with the upon-awakening spirapril treatment schedule but significantly increased toward a more dipping pattern with the bedtime treatment schedule. The proportion of patients with controlled ambulatory BP increased from 23 to 59% (p < 0.001) with bedtime treatment. Sleep-time BP regulation is significantly better achieved with bedtime spirapril administration. This might be clinically important, as the sleep-time BP mean has been shown to be a more relevant marker of cardiovascular risk than the awake mean values. These administration-time-dependent effects of spirapril seem to be a class-related feature, and may be associated with the nocturnal activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "381": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia found in clinical practice. The majority of patients with AF are still candidates for antiarrhythmic drug treatment, not only for acute reversion to sinus rhythm but also for long-term treatment to prevent recurrences of AF. Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs, however, are unable to provide complete efficacy in all patients, and present problematic risks of proarrhythmia. The progressively increasing prevalence of AF supports the need to develop improved therapeutic approaches for the clinical management of arrhythmia. Accordingly, new treatment techniques aimed at suppressing the origin of the arrhythmogenic foci have been developed in the last decade. However, ablative treatments are only available for selected patients. Because of these factors, and also because primary prevention of AF should be our goal, the introduction of non-antiarrhythmic agents that could prevent both new-onset AF and recurrences of AF may eventually improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of this epidemic disease. The potential clinical value of these non-antiarrhythmic options is currently under active investigation. There is now clinical and experimental evidence that many drugs may have beneficial effects in preventing AF through several possible mechanisms. Non-antiarrhythmic drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), corticosteroids, and N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may have a positive effect in patients with AF or in preventing AF in patients at risk.",

Alternatively, in patients in whom neuroendocrine activation is blocked with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blockers, diuretics may be beneficial by decreasing preload and afterload and preventing congestion.

It has also been reported that statins and RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibition and have anti-atherosclerotic properties. In the present study, we have investigated whether miR-146a/b was expressed with the TLR4 signal in CAD patients, and whether combined treatment with a statin and RAS inhibition might affect these levels. A total of 66 patients with CAD and 33 subjects without CAD (non-CAD) were enrolled. Patients with CAD were randomized to 12 months of combined treatment with atorvastatin and telmisartan [an ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker)] or atorvastatin and enalapril [an ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor)]. PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 12 months. Levels of miR-146a/b, IRAK1 mRNA, TRAF6 mRNA and TLR4 mRNA/TLR4 protein were significantly higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (all P<0.01). Levels of miR-146a/b were positively correlated with IRAK1 mRNA and TRAF6 mRNA levels. After 12 months of treatment, these levels were markedly decreased in the ARB and ACEI groups, with the decrease in the ARB group being greater than that in the ACEI group (all P<0.05). In our 12-month follow-up study, high levels of miR-146a and TLR4 mRNA/TLR4 protein at baseline were independent predictors of cardiac events. The present study demonstrates that combined treatment with an ARB and a statin decreases miR-146a/b and the TLR4 signal in CAD patients, possibly contributing to the anti-atherogenic effects of ARBs and statins in this disorder.",

    "390": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Efficacy and safety of currently employed antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) continue to be less optimal in AF. Development of newer AADs has recently been made possible through a greater understanding of electro-pathophysiology of AF. Highly specific drugs acting on atria are currently being explored, although there is little data available on effectiveness of atrial specific agents in maintaining sinus rhythm. Combining AADs and non-AADs such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may increase effectiveness of AADs in patients with AF. Controlled clinical trials are required to precisely define the efficacy of single agents versus various combinations in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF. This review describes some of the most promising therapeutic approaches that may overcome some of the limitations of drugs used at present for the management of AF.",

They were followed for 1.4 (+/-0.5) years: 52% had hypertension, 26% atrial fibrillation, 19% diabetes, and 15% were smokers. The odds ratio for prescription of antiplatelet was 2.20 (95% CI, 1.86 to 2.60) among the oldest patients (>or=85 years of age) compared with the youngest (18 to 64 years of age). The corresponding odds ratio was 0.38 (0.32 to 0.45) for prescriptions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 0.09 (0.08 to 0.11) for statins, and 0.07 (0.05 to 0.09) for anticoagulant therapy. Prescription of statin and anticoagulant therapy was associated with reduced risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.78 [0.65 to 0.91] and hazard ratio, 0.58 [0.44 to 0.76], respectively) but not the prescription of antiplatelet drugs or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.",

    "395": "Many studies have shown the renoprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with chronic kidney disease stages I-IV. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a positive effect of AII inhibitors on residual glomerular filtration rate (rGFR) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. However, these studies were small and were performed in a highly selected group of PD patients. Our aim was to confirm the above findings in a larger number of prospectively followed PD patients.",

Changes in rGFR over time were analyzed with a linear mixed model for repeated measures. In addition, Cox regression models were used to estimate the risk of developing anuria. In a second approach, we aimed to repeat the above analyses in a selected group of patients that theoretically could have been randomized and therefore resembled the population studied in the 2 mentioned RCTs. In this group the follow-up was restricted to 1 year.", 
    "397": "201 patients were treated with ACEi/ARBs and 251 did not take these drugs at the start of PD. More patients from the treated group had diabetes and used more antihypertensive medications. The time course of decline of rGFR was not different between the 2 groups over the 3 years of PD treatment (p = 0.52). Less than 25% of patients from each group became anuric and there was no difference in time to development of complete anuria between the treated and untreated groups. In the second approach, 130 patients were included: 37 were treated with ACEi/ARBs and 93 were not. Again, no difference was found between the 2 groups with respect to the rate of decline of rGFR and time of anuria development.", 
    "398": "Our findings are not in line with the results of previous RCTs. The biggest limitation of observational studies is the inability to avoid confounding by indication. However, a RCT in such a setting also does not give a reliable answer. Given all the benefits of ACEi/ARBs, the medications should not be withheld from PD patients. However, their renoprotective effects may often be overruled by other factors influencing the time course of rGFR.", 
    "399": "Heart failure (HF) is a modern epidemic and a heterogeneous disorder with many therapeutic options. While the average response to each individual treatment is favorable, significant interindividual variation exists in the response to HF therapeutics. As a result, the optimal regimen for an individual patient or subgroup of patients is elusive, with current treatment being mainly empirical. Pharmacogenetic customization of HF therapy may provide an important opportunity to improve the treatment of HF. Common genetic variations exist in genes related to most classes of HF drugs, many of which have known functional consequences for or established relationships with drug response. This review summarizes the current understanding of the pharmacogenetics of HF therapeutics, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers, and focuses on recent advances and medium-term expectations for the field.",

    "401": "Effective targeting of treatment strategies requires accurate assessment of blood pressure. Isolated use of manual office blood pressure measurement cannot detect white coat or masked hypertension. New information comparing automated office blood pressure (AOBP) to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) demonstrates that AOBP can minimize occurrence of white coat hypertension. From the public health perspective, reduction in salt consumption may be the single most important intervention, and could have a very significant impact on hypertension control. Further salt restriction strategies are effective means to decrease blood pressure even in patients with resistant hypertension. Provision of pharmacotherapy as single pill combinations is more effective than multiple drugs provided as monotherapy. From the hypertension practitioner perspective, complex choices are simplified, thus reducing therapeutic inertia. From the patient perspective, therapeutic turbulence is reduced and adherence to therapy increased. Combinations studied include thiazide diuretics with an inhibitor of the angiotensin system and the combination of amlodipine with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Amlodipine-based combinations are emerging as a valuable tool in the management of hypertension.",

The evidence is even more compelling for Black patients. New-onset diabetes associated with thiazides did not increase cardiovascular outcomes. The diuretic was superior to all in preventing heart failure with preserved left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and similar to the ACEI in preventing heart failure with impaired LVEF. It was also unsurpassed in preventing atrial fibrillation.",

    "406": "Anaphylaxis is a term that implies symptoms that are present in many organs, some of which are potentially fatal. The pathogenic process can either be IgE-dependent or non-IgE-dependent; the latter circumstance may be referred to as anaphylactoid. Bradykinin is frequently responsible for the manifestations of IgE-independent reactions. Blood levels may increase because of overproduction; diseases such as the various forms of C1 inhibitor deficiency (hereditary or acquired) or hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor are examples in this category. Blood levels may also increase because of an abnormality in bradykinin metabolism; the angioedema due to ACE inhibitors is a commonly encountered example. Angioedema due to bradykinin has the potential to cause airway obstruction and asphyxia as well as severe gastrointestinal symptoms simulating an acute abdomen. Formation of bradykinin in plasma is a result of a complex interaction among proteins such as factor XII, prekallikrein, and high molecular weight kininogen (HK) resulting in HK cleavage and liberation of bradykinin. These proteins also assemble along the surface of endothelial cells via zinc-dependent interactions with gC1qR, cytokeratin 1, and u-PAR. Endothelial cell expression (or secretion) of heat-shock protein 90 or prolylcarboxypeptidase can activate the prekallikrein-HK complex to generate bradykinin in the absence of factor XII, however factor XII is then secondarily activated by the kallikrein that results. Bradykinin is destroyed by carboxypeptidase N and angiotensin-converting enzyme. The hypotension associated with IgE-dependent anaphylaxis maybe mediated, in part, by massive proteolytic digestion of HK by kallikreins (tissue or plasma-derived) or other cell-derived kininogenases.", 
    "407": "The retina expresses a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS). This study aimed to investigate the influence of systemic modulation of renin synthesis on the expression of renin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which forms part of the blood/retina barrier. Freshly isolated RPE cells showed expression of renin 1A, which is the secreted isoform of renin. Systemic administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in mice increased the renin expression in both the kidney and the retina. Systemic infusion of ANG II led to a decrease in the renin expression in the kidney and in the retina and RPE. The ANG II-dependent down-regulation of renin expression in the RPE was prevented by systemic application of the AT(1) receptor blocker losartan. However, water deprivation lead to an increase of the renin expression in the kidney but unexpectedly to a decrease of the renin expression in the retina. In sections of the mouse retina, the ANG II receptor AT(1) was found in the RPE and localized at the blood side of the epithelium. Short-time cultured RPE cells showed increases in intracellular free Ca(2+) in response to stimulation by ANG II that were sensitive to losartan. In summary, we conclude that the renin expression in cells of the blood/retina barrier is influenced by the systemic RAS. ANG II circulating in the plasma is likely a mediator of this influence.",

For patients receiving an ACEI and a beta-blocker monotherapy, the estimated treatment difference was 8.2 mmHg (p < 0.001) and 5.8 mmHg (p = 0.002) in favour of lumiracoxib respectively. These treatment differences were greater than observed in the overall population (5.0 mmHg in favour of lumiracoxib).

Dual therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker have been shown to be more effective in reducing blood pressure and albuminuria than the single use of these agents. It was therefore expected that the combination of these drugs could delay the progression of renal disease. However, the ONTARGET renal analysis suggests that the use dual-agent RAS leads to increased renal risk.

The renal angiotensin II content decreased similarly in the groups treated with ACEi and/or HRP. Urinary protein excretion also decreased in the ACEi, High ACEi, and HRP groups and significantly further decreased in the ACEi+HRP group. The heart weight of the ACEi+HRP group was significantly lower than that of any other groups, although the cardiac angiotensin II levels decreased similarly in the groups treated with ACEi and/or HRP.

    "451": "Four peptides that inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were separated from the hydorlysate of boneless chicken leg meat digested with artificial gastric juice (pepsin). Two peptides were identified as the peptides encrypted in myosin heavy chain. The peptide P1 (MNVKHWPWMK) corresponds to the amino acid sequence from amino acids 825 to 834 of myosin heavy chain, and the peptide P4 (VTVNPYKWLP) corresponds to the amino acid sequence from amino acids 125 to 135 of myosin heavy chain. They are novel ACE inhibitory peptides derived from chicken, and IC(50) values of P1 and P4 were determined as 228 and 5.5 microM, respectively. Although these values were much larger than 0.022 microM for captopril, a typical synthetic ACE inhibitor, they are comparable to IC(50) values reported for various ACE inhibitory peptides derived from foods. Because the peptide P4 has a relatively low IC(50) value, it is a good starting substance for designing food supplements for hypertensive patients.", 
    "452": "An angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptide Ile-Gln-Pro with an IC(50) value of 5.77 +/- 0.09 microM was purified from the alcalase digests of Spirulina platensis by gel filtration chromatography and two steps of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The peptide was synthesized and showed resistance to in vitro digestion by gastrointestinal proteases. Kinetics studies indicated that the peptide was a noncompetitive inhibitor and that the K(i) value was 7.61 +/- 0.16 microM. Oral administration of Ile-Gln-Pro at a dosage of 10 mg/kg showed significant decreases of the weighted systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at 4, 6, and 8 h after treatment. The results showed that the ACE inhibitory peptide from Spirulina platensis may have potential for use in the prevention and treatment of hypertension.",

Atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases take a huge toll on the society, making them the leading cause of death in developed countries. Phenomenal advances in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and the molecular signaling pathways has revealed the role of endothelial dysfunction involved therein and thus has raised the possibility of novel therapeutic targets. Such potential cellular targets include the vascular smooth muscle cells, monocyte/macrophage cell lines, platelets, and endothelial cells. Certain studies affirm that antiplatelet agents, antioxidant therapies, amino acid supplementation, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers may prevent or slow the progression of the disease process. The race is on for new medicines that can treat and prevent heart attacks and strokes, arising out of atherosclerosis, which kills nearly 1 million people a year in the U.S.A alone.", 
    "459": "Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are responsible for two thirds of sudden cardiac deaths annually in the United States. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy prevents mortality from arrhythmic death but is expensive and has some associated morbidity from proarrhythmia and mechanical malfunction. Furthermore, ICDs treat ventricular arrhythmias but do not prevent them. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) can be used for acute or chronic therapy to prevent ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths. AADS are often used in patients with an ICD who have recurrent ICD shocks resulting from ventricular arrhythmias. Class I AADs are contraindicated in patients with structural heart disease. Other than amiodarone, all Class III drugs have either a neutral or deleterious effect on mortality. Dronedarone, a new Class III drug, may reduce mortality, but more information is needed to be sure. A class of drugs that do not qualify as an AAD can modify cardiovascular remodeling processes and have a delayed and indirect antiarrhythmic effect. These so-called \"nonantiarrhythmic drugs\" such as drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fish oil, and statins can reduce the likelihood of future ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in patients with coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. The role of AADs for chronic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death is problematic because of proarrhythmia and adverse side effects. Because these nonantiarrhythmic drugs are well tolerated and have no proarrhythmic actions, their benefits should outweigh risks.", 
    "460": "Background. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) decrease cardiovascular mortality and slow the progression of renal disease in non-transplant patients, but their impact on kidney transplant outcome has not been well established.Methods. Patients receiving a renal allograft in Spain in 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002 were considered for the present study. Only adult (>/=18 years) recipients of a single kidney transplant functioning at the end of the first year were considered. A total of 4842 patients with clinical data about ACEI/ARB therapy were included.Results. During the initial 2 years after transplant, ACEI/ARB were less frequently used in the 1990 and 1994 cohorts than in 1998 and 2002 (15.1%, 24.6%, 33.5% and 45.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). During the first year, a total of 1063 patients (22.8%) received ACEI/ARB treatment, and graft survival (50.0% for treated patients and 51.4% for untreated, P = ns), death-censored graft survival (60.6% versus 63.5%, P = ns) and patient survival (68.8% versus 66.6%, P = ns) were not different. During the initial 2 years, 1472 patients (31.4%) received treatment with ACEI/ARB, and graft survival tended to be higher in treated patients (54.4% and 50.9%, P = 0.063). Since there was an interaction between ACEI/ARB treatment and year of transplant, graft survival was analysed in each cohort. Cox regression analysis including the propensity score for ACEI/ARB treatment showed an association between ACEI/ARB treatment and graft survival in the 2002 cohort (relative risk 0.36 and 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.75, P = 0.007). Death-censored graft survival (63.8% versus 63.1%, P = ns) and patient survival (68.1% and 66.5%, P = ns) were not significantly different.Conclusions. The use of ACEI/ARB during the initial 2 years after transplantation was associated with a better graft survival, but this effect was only observed in the 2002 cohort.",

    "462": "One hundred ninety-three consecutive patients were enrolled into one of four groups depending on their blood pressure and existing treatment: (i) controlled hypertensive patients treated with per/ind (controlled-per/ind), (ii) controlled hypertensive patients treated with agents other than angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or diuretics (controlled-other), (iii) uncontrolled hypertensive patients treated with agents other than ACE inhibitors or diuretics (uncontrolled-other), (iv) untreated normotensive subjects. Macro- and microcirculation parameters were evaluated once in every patient. We used intravital video microscopy to measure dermal capillary density in the dorsum of the fingers. Microvascular endothelial function was assessed by measuring the perfusion increases after pilocarpine iontophoresis and central hemodynamic parameters by tonometry.",

Men were more likely than women to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor monotherapy but just as likely to be prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic combination. Women were more likely to be prescribed all other classes of antihypertensive therapy. Suboptimal adherence occurred in 32% of patients receiving thiazide diuretics, 25% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and 38% for angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/diuretic combination.

Since oxidative stress has gained importance in the last few years as one of the mechanisms involved in the origin and development of hypertension, and considering that L-carnitine (LC) is a useful compound in different pathologies characterized by increased oxidative status, the aim of the present study was to investigate the systemic antioxidant effect of LC and its correlation to blood pressure in two experimental models of hypertension: (1) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and (2) rats with hypertension induced by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Treatment with captopril was also performed in SHR in order to compare the antioxidant and antihypertensive effects of LC and captopril. The antioxidant defense capacity, in terms of antioxidant enzyme activity, glutathione system availability and plasma total antioxidant capacity, was measured in both animal models with or without an oral, chronic treatment with LC. All the antioxidant parameters studied were diminished in SHR and in L-NAME-treated animals, an alteration that was in general reversed after treatments with LC and captopril. In addition, LC produced a significant but not complete reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels in these two models of hypertension, whereas captopril was able to normalize blood pressure. Both LC and captopril prevented the reduction in nitric oxide (NO) levels observed in hypertensive animals. This suggests a decrease in the systemic oxidative stress and a higher availability of NO induced by LC in a similar way to captopril's effects, which could be relevant in the management of arterial hypertension eventually.", 
    "474": "Following the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and ischemic heart disease, there has been increasing interest in the bradykinin-mediated aspects of ACE inhibition. Several preclinical and clinical studies have been conducted using genetically engineered animals or pharmacological agonists and antagonists of the two receptors of bradykinin, B(1)R and B(2)R. The results have mostly indicated that the B(1)R, whose expression is induced by tissue damage, seem to have mostly noxious effects, whereas the constitutively expressed B(2)R, when activated, exert mostly beneficial actions. Accumulating evidence in the recent literature suggests that the B(2)R have an important role in the process of ischemic post-conditioning that limits the ischemia/reperfusion injury of the myocardium. In this article, we describe a series of experiments conducted on mice submitted to acute myocardial infarct and treated either with ACE inhibition (which produces potentiation of bradykinin resulting in non-selective B(1)R and B(2)R activation) or with a potent and highly selective B(2)R agonist. These data suggest that this latter pharmacological approach offers functional and structural benefits and is therefore a promising cardioprotective therapeutic modality against acute ischemic events.", 
    "475": "Many experimental and clinical studies suggest a relationship between enhanced angiotensin II release by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. The atherosclerosis-enhancing effects of angiotensin II are complex and incompletely understood. To identify anti-atherogenic target genes, we performed microarray gene expression profiling of the aorta during atherosclerosis prevention with the ACE inhibitor, captopril. Atherosclerosis-prone apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice were used as a model to decipher susceptible genes regulated during atherosclerosis prevention with captopril. Microarray gene expression profiling and immunohistology revealed that captopril treatment for 7 months strongly decreased the recruitment of pro-atherogenic immune cells into the aorta. Captopril-mediated inhibition of plaque-infiltrating immune cells involved down-regulation of the C-C chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9). Reduced cell migration correlated with decreased numbers of aorta-resident cells expressing the CCR9-specific chemoattractant factor, chemokine ligand 25 (CCL25). The CCL25-CCR9 axis was pro-atherogenic, because inhibition of CCR9 by RNA interference in hematopoietic progenitors of apoE-deficient mice significantly retarded the development of atherosclerosis. Analysis of coronary artery biopsy specimens of patients with coronary artery atherosclerosis undergoing bypass surgery also showed strong infiltrates of CCR9-positive cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, the C-C chemokine receptor, CCR9, exerts a significant role in atherosclerosis.",

These problems increase morbidity and mortality in the elderly. Overactivity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is associated with the development of hypertension, cardiovascular events, and CKD, so targeting the RAAS is a logical therapeutic approach. Elderly patients present special concerns regarding the benefits versus risks of using RAAS blockers. Plasma renin activity declines with age, which has been attributed to the effect of age-associated nephrosclerosis. Plasma aldosterone is also reduced with age, resulting in a greater risk for hyperkalemia in older individuals, especially when coupled with the age-associated decline in GFR. Moreover, the elderly have a higher frequency of concurrent conditions and are on many medications, which may further increase the risk for adverse effects of RAAS blocking agents. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature that is specifically aimed at studying elderly using the RAAS blockers. We present in our in-depth review data regarding benefits and limitations of the use of the RAAS blockades on the various sites along the RAAS pathway for elderly patients.

Furthermore, Scriptaid enhanced Ang II induced decrease in Sprouty (Spry) 1 gene expression in cultured UB cells. Treatment of intact E12.5 mouse metanephroi grown ex vivo with Ang II (10(-5) M, 24 h) increased HDAC-1 and decreased total acetylated histone H3 protein levels. These findings indicate that lack of endogenous Ang II in AGT-deficient mice inhibits UB branching. We conclude that intact RAS is critical in structural integrity of the renal collecting system and that UB morphogenetic program genes, such as AGT, renin, ACE, AT1R, or Spry1, are epigenetically controlled via HDACs.",

    "515": "Although ATRA is a potent renoprotective agent, relatively little is known regarding the mechanisms of its action. The present study was designed to further elucidate the mechanisms of ATRA's action to GS rats and compare that with the beneficial effect of benazepril. Male SD rats weighting 160 to 200g were used in this study. GS was induced by unilateral nephrectomy and intravenous injection of adriamycin (6mg/kg). They were divided randomly 20 ones per group into GS group, GS treated with ATRA (20mg/kg/day) group, and GS treated with benazepril (10mg/kg/day) group. The other 20 ones were taken as sham-operation group, injected normal saline into caudal vein. 12weeks later, all rats were subjected to sacrifice. As expected, the GS group exhibited significant lower serum TP and Alb, and higher BUN, Cr and proteinuria than those of the sham group. Administration of ATRA or benazepril did ameliorate these above disorders of biochemical parameters in GS rats. Extensive renal damage was observed in the GS group, such as mononuclear infiltration, mesangial proliferation, focal segment glomerular sclerosis, and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The pathological changes in both ATRA and benazepril group were alleviated remarkably. Semiquantitative GSI was used to evaluate the degree of GS in all groups. GSI was significantly higher in the GS group than in sham group. GSI decreased from 21.9+/-6.7 in the GS group to 6.9+/-2.8 in the ATRA group and 7.0+/-2.7 in benazepril group respectively. However, no significant difference in GSI between rats treated with ATRA and rats treated with benazepril was found. RT-PCR analysis revealed the renal expression of alpha-SMA mRNA was induced substantially in GS group as compared to sham group, which could be offset completely by ATRA or benazepril administration. However, expression level of alpha-SMA mRNA in GS rats treated with ATRA was identical to that in GS rats treated with benazepril. We also examined immunohistochemical staining for renal alpha-SMA, TGF-beta1, Col IV, and FN in this model. Weak staining was observed in some glomerulus, mesangial cells, and tubular interstitium of sham rats. Staining was markedly enhanced in the majority of glomerulus, mesangial cells, and tubular interstitium of untreated GS rats. Compared with untreated GS animals, intensity and extent of staining for renal alpha-SMA, TGF-beta1, Col IV, and FN were markedly reduced in glomerulus, mesangial cells, and tubular interstitium of GS rats treated with either ATRA or benazepril. However, no significant differences existed between ATRA and benazepril with respect to the glomerular and tubulointerstitial staining scores. Interestingly, our data documented some differences of therapeutic capacities between ATRA and benazepril. In comparison with benazepril, ATRA exerted no improvement in hypoproteinemia, but more significant decrease in serum Cr level in GS rats. The reasons leading to these variations are unclear. Whatever they are, the properties of down-regulate inflammatory/proliferative programs may make ATRA an attractive potential candidate for future therapeutic use in kidney disease.",

We conducted this study in an attempt to evaluate the potential of a novel class of medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as treatments for methamphetamine dependence. All participants met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, third revision (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for methamphetamine abuse or dependence and were not seeking treatment at the time of study entry. The study was conducted using a double-blind design. Subjects received a baseline series of intravenous (IV) doses of methamphetamine (15 mg and 30 mg) and placebo. Subjects received a second identical series of methamphetamine doses 3 and 5 days after initiation of once-daily oral placebo or perindopril treatment. The dose of perindopril was 2 mg, 4mg, or 8 mg administered in the morning. Perindopril treatment was tolerated well. There were no main effects of perindopril on methamphetamine-induced changes in cardiovascular or subjective effects. There were significant perindoprilmethamphetamine interactions for diastolic blood pressure and for ratings of \"Any Drug Effect\", indicating inverted U dose-effect functions for these indices.",

    "518": "ProAngiotensin-12 (PA12) is the most recent peptide to be identified as a functional component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). PA12 is reported to constrict rat coronary arteries and the aorta, dependent upon angiotensin II-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) and chymase. The current study employed myography to determine the direct vascular effects of PA12 on a range of isolated rat arteries extending from the core to periphery. PA12 significantly constricted the descending thoracic aorta, right and left common carotid arteries, abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery, with little effect on the femoral and renal arteries. AngII was found to produce similar responses to PA12 when administered at the same dose. A potency gradient in response to PA12 was clearly apparent, with vessels in closest proximity to the heart responding with the greatest constriction; while constrictive potency was lost further form the heart. Inhibition of ACE1 and chymase both significantly attenuated PA12-induced vasoconstriction, with chymostatin displaying lesser potency. We postulate ACE1 primarily regulates RAS activity within the circulation, while chymase may have an important role in local, tissue-based RAS activity.", 
    "519": "The HOPE and EUROPA clinical studies have shown that treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ramipril and perindopril, may reduce the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with proven atherosclerotic disease. The recently published results of the PRoFESS and TRANSCEND trials completed the much needed information concerning the use of an angiotensin receptor blocker for patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. PROFESS compared a therapy of telmisartan 80 mg daily with placebo in patients with a recent ischemic stroke. The difference in the primary outcome of first recurrent stroke was not statistically significant between telmisartan and placebo. The secondary outcome of major cardiovascular events showed a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 7% in favour of telmisartan. This tended to be significant (p = 0.06) despite a rather short follow-up period of only 28 months. In TRANSCEND 5926 patients at high risk for cardiovascular events were randomized to a treatment with telmisartan 80 mg daily or placebo for a mean duration of follow-up of 56 months. The primary composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or hospitalization for heart failure showed a non-significant 8% RRR in favour of the telmisartan treated patients. The main secondary outcome of cardiovascular death and myocardial infarction or stroke as used in the HOPE trial showed a non-significant RRR of 13% in favour of telmisartan treated patients (p = 0.068 adjusted for multiplicity of comparisons). In comparing the Kaplan-Meier curves for the endpoint of major cardiovascular events used in HOPE, EUROPA, TRANSCEND and PRoFESS, the trends are similar. Results of most of the recently published trials have been neutral.This could partly be explained by major improvements in the optimal background therapy of the patients included. Nevertheless, the results of PRoFESS and TRANSCEND do not contradict the results from previous studies with theACE inhibitors ramipril and perindopril and the ARB telmisartan.",

These benefits were paralleled by a -4.1 and -2.8 mmHg difference between the groups for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, respectively. Patients randomized to nifedipine GITS but no RAS blockers (n=2966) when compared to those receiving RAS blockers but no nifedipine GITS (n=880) had highly statistically significant reductions in cardiovascular events (22%), new-onset heart failure (53%), and debilitating stroke (45%).

A total of 34 adverse drug reactions were observed in 250 hypertensive patients during the four month study. A high percentage of adverse drug reactions occurred in middle aged and female patients. Of the 34 adverse drug reactions, 18 (52.9%) were mild, 14 (41.2%) moderate and only 2 (5.8%) were classified as severe. Combination therapy was associated with significantly high occurrence (P < 0.05) of adverse drug reactions, with a total of 21 (61.8%) as compared to monotherapy (n=13, 38.2%). Cardiovascular adverse drug reactions constituted a major component, followed by gastrointestinal and respiratory complaints. Beta-blockers were the drug category associated with majority of adverse drug reactions, followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. The above pharmacovigilance study presents the adverse drug reaction profile of antihypertensive medicines prescribed in our University Teaching Hospital.

Overall, RAS inhibition reduced the odds ratio for AF by 33% (p < 0.00001), but there was substantial heterogeneity among trials. In primary prevention, RAS inhibition was effective in patients with heart failure and those with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy but not in post-myocardial infarction patients overall. In secondary prevention, RAS inhibition was often administered in addition to antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone, further reducing the odds for AF recurrence after cardioversion by 45% (p = 0.01) and in patients on medical therapy by 63% (p < 0.00001).",

Human somatic ACE (sACE) has two homologous domains (N and C). The N- and C-domain catalytic sites have different activities toward various substrates. Moreover, some of the undesirable side effects of the currently available and widely used ACE inhibitors may arise from their targeting both domains leading to defects in other pathways. In addition, structural studies have shown that although both these domains have much in common at the inhibitor binding site, there are significant differences and these are greater at the peptide binding sites than regions distal to the active site. As a model system, we have used an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster (AnCE, a single domain protein with ACE activity) to study ACE inhibitor binding. In an extensive study, we present high-resolution structures for native AnCE and in complex with six known antihypertensive drugs, a novel C-domain sACE specific inhibitor, lisW-S, and two sACE domain-specific phosphinic peptidyl inhibitors, RXPA380 and RXP407 (i.e., nine structures). These structures show detailed binding features of the inhibitors and highlight subtle changes in the orientation of side chains at different binding pockets in the active site in comparison with the active site of N- and C-domains of sACE.

Twenty-eight patients were randomized to receive treatment with one of the three therapeutic regimens: cyclosporine with methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide with methylprednisolone or lisinopril (control). Renal function and nephrotic syndrome parameters were determined at baseline and during a 9-month treatment period. At the end of the study period, renal function improved significantly in the cyclophosphamide and deteriorated significantly in the cyclosporine group.

Furthermore in clinical intervention trials they reduce blood pressure and arterial stiffness. The exact mechanisms are not known, but inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) has been suggested mainly to mediate these beneficial effects. The present study investigated the in vitro effects of three tripeptides: Ile-Pro-Pro, Val-Pro-Pro and leqcine-proline-proline (Leu-Pro-Pro) on four renin-angiotensin system enzymes: ACE1, ACE2, chymase, and cathepsin G. Also their effects on arginase I, a critical enzyme in L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway, were studied. It was shown, apparently for the first time, that the inhibitory effects of Ile-Pro-Pro, Val-Pro-Pro and Leu-Pro-Pro on ACE1 at micromolar concentrations are competitive in nature. Therefore the efficacy of inhibition is largely dependent on the amount of substrate present. Inhibition of ACE2 and arginase I was reached only at concentrations three orders of magnitude greater. No inhibition of chymase and cathepsin G was observed by the tripeptides.

For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to less than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other agents, considerations for initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as initial treatment of hypertension if systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used, unless compelling indications are present to suggest consideration of dual therapy. Agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include thiazide diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with coronary artery disease, ACE inhibitors, ARBs or betablockers are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. In selected high-risk patients in whom combination therapy is being considered, an ACE inhibitor plus a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB is preferable to an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian lipid treatment guidelines. Selected patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy, but who are otherwise at high risk for cardiovascular events, should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered.",

The kidney contains all elements of the RAAS, and intrarenal formation of angiotensin II not only controls glomerular hemodynamics and tubule sodium transport, but also activates a number of inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that the intrarenal RAAS is activated early in diabetic nephropathy, the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers decrease the rate of decline in kidney function in patients with diabetic and non-diabetic nephropathy, many patients still progress to end-stage renal disease or die from cardiovascular events. There is still a clear need for additional strategies to block the RAAS more effectively to reduce progression of CKD. The focus of this paper is to review the importance of the intrarenal RAAS in CKD and recent findings in renin-angiotensin biology pertinent to the kidney. We also discuss additional strategies to inhibit the RAAS more effectively and the potential impact of direct renin inhibition on the prevention and management of CKD.",

A single immunization of female WKY rats with more than 10 microg of recombinant alpha3(IV)NC1 protein caused severe proteinuria followed by progressive increases in plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level within 42 days. Sequential histopathological evaluation revealed crescent formation in glomeruli followed by tubular dilation and interstitial fibrosis. Hydroxyproline content and expression of type I collagen and smooth muscle actin genes in the renal cortex increased as renal dysfunction progressed. Furthermore, the TGF-beta1 level in the renal cortex also increased. In the evaluation of antinephritic agents in this model, prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment significantly decreased plasma creatinine and BUN, and suppressed renal fibrosis and histological changes involving crescent formation, compared with the vehicle-treated nephritic rats, whereas lisinopril treatment failed to improve renal function and histology. We demonstrated that immunization of female WKY rats with a sufficient dose of recombinant alpha3(IV)NC1 induces end-stage kidney disease accompanied by renal fibrosis. The relatively short period needed to induce the disease and the high incidence of functional and structural changes were considered a great advantage of this model for clarifying the mechanisms of progressive glomerulonephritis and for evaluating agents used to treat renal failure.", 
    "564": "The fetal heart is highly sensitive to changes in mechanical load. We have previously demonstrated that increased cardiac load can stimulate cell cycle activity and maturation of immature cardiomyocytes, but the effects of reduced load are not known. Sixteen fetal sheep were given either continuous intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer solution (LR) or enalaprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor beginning at 127 days gestational age. After 8 days, fetal arterial pressure in the enalaprilat-infused fetuses (23.8 +/- 2.8 mmHg) was lower than that of control fetuses (47.5 +/- 4.7 mmHg) (P < 0.0001). Although the body weights of the two groups of fetuses were similar, the heart weight-to-body weight ratios of the enalaprilat-infused fetuses were less than those of the LR-infused fetuses (5.6 +/- 0.5 g/kg vs. 7.0 +/- 0.6 g/kg, P < 0.0001). Dimensions of ventricular myocytes were not different between control and enalaprilat-infused fetuses. However, there was a significant decrease in cell cycle activity in both the right ventricle (P < 0.005) and the left ventricle (P < 0.002) of the enalaprilat-infused fetuses. Thus, we conclude a sustained reduction in systolic pressure load decreases hyperplastic growth in the fetal heart.",

However, one of the difficulties with achieving these blood pressure goals quickly is that monotherapy is often insufficient. Many large randomized trials have shown that two or more antihypertensive agents are required for patients to reach their treatment goals. Recent data have suggested that the use of combination therapy in patients with hypertension may be beneficial in terms of improving blood-pressure-lowering efficacy, obtaining blood pressure goals earlier, and reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. Studies have found that therapy with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) combined with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor significantly reduces both blood pressure and major clinical events compared with an ACE inhibitor-diuretic combination. Combination ACE inhibitor-CCB therapy has also demonstrated superior blood-pressure-lowering efficacy and safety compared with either group used as monotherapy, including lower rates of peripheral edema compared with those achieved with increased doses of CCBs. The combination of an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II-receptor blocker has not been found to be superior to either group as monotherapy in patients with hypertension and should not be recommended at this time.",

At the tested 600 mg/kg.d and 1200 mg/kg x d doses, SFH significantly lowered blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) after chronic oral administration. SFH was further purified using consecutive chromatographic methods on Sephadex G-15 column and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on an octadecylsilane column. After its purity was confirmed by analytical RP-HPLC and capillary electrophoresis, one ACE inhibitory dipeptide was isolated, and its molecular mass and amino acid sequence were determined as 238.2 Da and Gly-Tyr, respectively, by LC-ESI/MS.

Therefore, the inhibition of ACE activity is a major target in the prevention of hypertension. Recently, the search for natural ACE inhibitors as alternatives to synthetic drugs is of great interest to prevent several side effects and a number of novel compounds such as bioactive peptides, chitooligosaccharide derivatives (COS) and phlorotannins have been derived from marine organisms as potential ACE inhibitors.

Blockade of RAAS with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) results in suppression of Ang II levels, which eventually return to baseline levels after prolonged ACEI administration. This leads to an escape phenomenon through generation of Ang II from enzymes other than ACE and led to the hypothesis that dual blockade of RAAS with an ACEI/Ang receptor blocker (ARB) combination could lead to total blockade of RAAS, since ARBs block the action of Ang II at the AT1 receptor level, irrespective of the mechanism of Ang II generation and will have an additive blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect. However, this hypothesis has not materialized clinically, as the ACEI/ARB combination produces modest BP reductions that are not significantly greater than monotherapy with the component drugs, and is frequently associated with higher incidence of side effects. A new dual RAAS blockade with the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren and the ARB valsartan produces greater BP reductions than monotherapy with the component drugs and is safe and well tolerated.

Bath fluid was collected to verify angiotensin generation. Bronchial tissue was homogenized to determine renin, angiotensinogen and serotonin content. Compound 48/80 contracted bronchi to 24+/-4% of the KCl-induced contraction. Ketanserin fully abolished this effect, while cromolyn reduced the contraction to 16+/-5%. Aliskiren, captopril, irbesartan and phentolamine did not affect this response, and the angiotensin I and II levels in the bath fluid after 48/80 exposure were below the detection limit. Angiotensin I and II equipotently contracted bronchi. Captopril shifted the angiotensin I curve approximately 10-fold to the right, whereas irbesartan fully blocked the effect of angiotensin II. Bradykinin-induced constriction was shifted approximately 100-fold to the left with captopril. Serotonin contracted bronchi, and ketanserin fully blocked this effect. Finally, bronchial tissue contained serotonin at micromolar levels, whereas renin and angiotensinogen were undetectable in this preparation. In conclusion, mast cell degranulation results in serotonin-induced bronchoconstriction, and is unlikely to involve renin-induced angiotensin generation.",

The diminishing value of successive interventions is further reduced by adverse consequences (eg, drug-drug, drug-disease, and drug-nutrient interactions), as well as by the total expenditures of time, energy, and resources, which increase with each additional intervention.

Further, the affinities for ACE of a set of physiological substrates were determined using the same assay. BK has the highest affinity (K(i) 525 nM) among known substrates to displace [(3)H]enalaprilat binding from ACE. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha repressed the expression of ACE in HUVECs while phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) upregulated it in 24h (approximately 12-fold dynamic range by [(3)H]enalaprilat binding, corroborated by ACE immunoblotting). Intermediate levels of ACE expression were seen in cells stimulated with both PMA and a cytokine. In contrast, high glucose, insulin or EGF failed to affect ACE expression. The effect of TNF-alpha was abated by etanercept, the IKK2 inhibitor TPCA-1, or a p38 inhibitor while that of PMA was reduced by inhibitors of PKC isoforms sensitive to phorbol esters and calcium. The short-term PKC- and MEK1-dependent increase of c-Fos expression was best correlated to PMA-induced ACE upregulation. The [(3)H]enalaprilat binding assay applied to HUVECs supports that ACE is a particularly active kininase and that endothelial ACE expression is dynamically and specifically regulated.

In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, telmisartan has proved superior to other antihypertensive agents (valsartan, losartan, ramipril, perindopril, and atenolol) in controlling blood pressure particularly towards the end of the dosing interval. There is also clinical evidence that telmisartan reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, reduces arterial stiffness and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and confers renoprotection. The ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study has demonstrated that telmisartan has similar cardiovascular protective effects to ramipril in a large, high-risk patient population but was better tolerated. The powerful and sustained blood pressure control apparent in clinical trials, together with cardiovascular protection and tolerability demonstrated in ONTARGET means that telmisartan may be a preferred option for patients with hypertension.",

The nongenomic effects of aldosterone to increase fibrosis, collagen deposition, inflammation, and remodeling of the heart and blood vessels, however, are markedly increased in the presence of high sodium intake. The genomic effect of aldosterone increases renal sodium transport, but the administration of large doses of aldosterone to normal individuals does not cause edema, relating to the phenomenon of \"aldosterone escape\"; however, in edematous disorders including cardiac failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome, impaired aldosterone escape leads to renal sodium retention and edema formation. There is now considerable evidence for the nongenomic effects of aldosterone in several important diseases. Thus, low dosages of mineralocorticoid antagonists, with little or no effect on urinary sodium excretion, have been shown to afford a beneficial effect on morbidity and mortality in patients with advanced cardiac failure and after acute myocardial infarction. Three-drug-resistant hypertension has also been found to respond to spironolactone in modest dosages. The combination of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) with spironolactone to treat such resistant hypertension may be more effective than adding an angiotensin receptor blocker to an ACEI. The role of spironolactone has also been shown to decrease albuminuria in chronic kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy in the presence of maximal dosages of ACEI. The effect of aldosterone in metabolic syndrome is also discussed in this review.", 
    "672": "The pathophysiology of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)-induced angioedema most likely resembles that of hereditary angioedema, ie, it is mainly mediated by bradykinin-induced activation of vascular bradykinin B2 receptors. We hypothesize that the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant might be an effective therapy for ACEi-induced angioedema.", 
    "673": "Eight patients with acute ACEi-induced angioedema were treated with a single subcutaneous injection of icatibant. The outcome was assessed by the time to first improvement of symptoms, complete symptom relief, and drug safety. In addition, we retrospectively assessed the clinical course of 47 consecutive patients of our clinic with ACEi-induced angioedema.", 
    "674": "First symptom improvement after icatibant injection occurred at a mean time of 50.6 minutes (standard deviation [SD] 21 minutes) and complete relief of symptoms at 4.4 hours (SD 0.8 hours). No patient received tracheal intubation, other drug treatment, tracheotomy, or a second icatibant injection. There were no adverse effects except erythema occurring at the injection site. In the historical comparison group treated with methylprednisolone and clemastine, the mean time to complete relief of symptoms was 33 hours (SD 19.4 hours). Some of these patients received a tracheotomy (3/47), were intubated (2/47), or received a second dose of methylprednisolone (12/47).",

Research studies that assessed the association between the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) heart failure performance measures from the inpatient setting and patient outcomes were examined. Studies were restricted to those conducted within the United States from 2001 until the present and included at least 1 of the ACC/AHA performance measures for chronic heart failure and a clinical outcome as an endpoint. Eleven original studies and 1 literature review met the study inclusion criteria. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker and beta-blocker use at discharge had the strongest association with improved patient outcomes, whereas discharge instructions had a weaker but positive effect.", 
    "678": "The findings from this systematic review suggest that an increase in compliance with the heart failure performance measures leads to a consistent positive impact on patient outcomes although the strength, magnitude, and significance of this effect is variable across the individual performance indicators. Further longitudinal studies and additional measure sets may yield deeper insights into the causal relationship between heart failure processes of care and clinical outcomes.",

The differences between cLDL-C and mLDL-C were similar according to usage of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB)/angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), CNI, or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTOR), tacrolimus or cyclosporine, and serum creatinine levels. mLDL-C and cLDL (FF) were highly correlated (r = 0.977). The mLDL-C level was calculated by following formula: LDL-C = 8.018 + (0.99 x FF cLDL-C) and the mean difference was 0 for last formula.",

The coefficient of determination correlation (r) for this regression was 0.977, which indicates that the calculated LDL-C levels can be used in RTRs with TG lower than 400 mg/dL. mLDL-C was significantly higher than cLDL-C. We observed that difference between cLDL-C and mLDL-C levels were not affected by serum creatinine levels and usage of CNIs, sirolimus, everolimus, ACEI, and ARB in RTRs.", 
    "683": "A set of eight lactoferricin B (LfcinB)-derived peptides was examined for inhibitory effects on angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity and ACE-dependent vasoconstriction, and their hypotensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Peptides were derived from different elongations both at the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of the representative peptide LfcinB(20-25), which is known as the LfcinB antimicrobial core. All of the eight LfcinB-derived peptides showed in vitro inhibitory effects on ACE activity with different IC(50) values. Moreover, seven of them showed ex vivo inhibitory effects on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. No clear correlation between in vitro and ex vivo inhibitory effects was found. Only LfcinB(20-25) and one of its fragments, F1, generated after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion, showed significant antihypertensive effects in SHR after oral administration. Remarkably, F1 did not show any effect on ACE-dependent vasoconstriction in contrast to the inhibitory effect showed by LfcinB(20-25). In conclusion, two LfcinB-derived peptides lower blood pressure and exhibit potential as orally effective antihypertensive compounds, yet a complete elucidation of the mechanism(s) involved deserves further ongoing research.", 
    "684": "The development of essential hypertension (EH) and inter-individual differences in response to antihypertensive treatment may partly result from genetic heterogeneity. In this study, we conducted an investigation of the combined effects of 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T and methionine synthase (MS) A2756G polymorphisms on baseline blood pressure (BP) and BP response to antihypertensive Benazepril treatment in 823 Chinese hypertensive patients with a fixed daily dosage of 10\u2009mg for 15 consecutive days. When MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G polymorphisms were modelled together with adjustment for important covariates, only MTHFR C677T was associated with baseline systolic BP (SBP) (\u03b2 (s.e.)=2.84 (1.10), P=0.0096) or baseline diastolic BP (DBP) (\u03b2 (s.e.)=2.19 (0.65), P=0.0008). Modelled together with adjustment for important covariates, MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G polymorphisms were both independently associated with increased DBP response (baseline minus post-treatment) to Benazepril treatment (C677T: \u03b2 (s.e.)=1.58 (0.76), P=0.038; A2756G: \u03b2 (s.e.)=2.14 (0.89), P=0.016). Neither polymorphism was associated with SBP response to Benazepril treatment. There were no significant interactions or effect modification between MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G gene polymorphisms in models of baseline SBP, baseline DBP or DBP response to Benazepril treatment. Our results suggest that the effects of MTHFR C677T and MS A2756G gene polymorphisms may have pivotal roles in the aetiology of EH and BP response to Benazepril treatment.", 
    "685": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) improves hemodynamics and may ameliorate oxidative stress in heart failure (HF). Through activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, angiotensin II induces superoxide, which is primarily cleared by cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD). We examined the interdependency of hemodynamics and levels of Cu/Zn-SOD and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in HF patients, using a randomized, double-blinded, crossover design to compare (i) the outcomes of single-agent therapy with either benazepril or valsartan alone vs. the combination thereof and (ii) the outcome of single-agent treatment with benazepril vs. single-agent treatment with valsartan. After each treatment, arterial (ART) and coronary sinus (CS) blood samples were collected. Cu/Zn-SOD and oxLDL levels were higher in CS samples than in ART samples. Furthermore, patients under combined treatment exhibited the highest CS levels of Cu/Zn-SOD, whereas there was no significant difference between the groups on either benazepril or valsartan alone. This finding suggests an augmentation of the cardiac antioxidative potential under more complete RAS inhibition. Cu/Zn-SOD and oxLDL levels correlated with measures of afterload rather than preload, which in turn suggests a beneficial effect of afterload reduction on oxidative stress in HF.", 
    "686": "In most patients with hypertensive nephropathy and low glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the kidney function progressively declines despite the adequate control of the hypertension with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Previously we found that 2 years of oral sodium citrate slowed GFR decline in patients whose estimated GFR (eGFR) was very low (mean 33 ml/min). This treatment also slowed GFR decline in an animal model of surgically reduced nephron mass. Here, we tested if daily oral sodium bicarbonate slowed GFR decline in patients with hypertensive nephropathy with reduced but relatively preserved eGFR (mean 75 ml/min) in a 5-year, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, and blinded interventional study. Patients matched for age, ethnicity, albuminuria, and eGFR received daily placebo or equimolar sodium chloride or bicarbonate while maintaining antihypertensive regimens (including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition) aiming for their recommended blood pressure targets. After 5 years, the rate of eGFR decline, estimated using plasma cystatin C, was slower and eGFR was higher in patients given sodium bicarbonate than in those given placebo or sodium chloride. Thus, our study shows that in hypertensive nephropathy, daily sodium bicarbonate is an effective kidney protective adjunct to blood pressure control along with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.", 
    "687": "Myopathy occurs in approximately 10% of statin-treated patients and is most commonly manifested by myalgias with or without plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations. Predisposition exists in patients treated with high doses of potent statins and those who are older, female, have a genetic predisposition, and when statins are coadministered with drugs that compete with or inhibit drug metabolism. In symptomatic patients, CK levels may assist in guiding management. If less than five times the upper limit of normal, the existing statin should be titrated to achieve cholesterol goals and the CK repeated when symptoms appear or worsen. In patients with moderate to severe symptoms and any patient with CK elevated to more than 5-fold the upper limit of normal, the statin should be stopped. Once asymptomatic and CK is reduced (if elevated previously), cholesterol goals can be approached by: 1) a different statin (e.g. fluvastatin or pravastatin), starting with a low dose and titrating up; 2) an alternate daily or weekly more potent statin (e.g. rosuvastatin or atorvastatin); or 3) the combination of the lowest tolerated statin with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) and/or bile acid sequestrant. Over-the-counter preparations, e.g. red yeast rice, containing natural statin-like agents, or plant sterols can also lower cholesterol. These, however, have limited efficacy to achieve targeted cholesterol levels for most patients. In patients without CK elevations and symptoms, progress can be followed clinically, but in patients who show CK elevations, CK should be monitored. At present, the superiority of one approach has not been demonstrated, and the need for clinical trials in well-characterized patients with statin intolerance cannot be dismissed.", 
    "688": "There is strong evidence for the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with myocardial infarction (MI), whereas the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers is less clear. We evaluated the effects of an angiotensin receptor blocker losartan and a beta-blocker metoprolol on left ventricular (LV) remodeling, c-kit+ cells, proliferation, fibrosis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis using a model of coronary ligation in rats. Metoprolol treatment for 2 weeks improved LV systolic function. In contrast, losartan triggered deleterious structural remodeling and functional deterioration of LV systolic function, ejection fraction being 41% and fractional shortening 47% lower in losartan group than in controls 2 weeks after MI. The number of c-kit+ cells as well as expression of Ki-67 was increased by metoprolol. Losartan-induced thinning of the anterior wall and ventricular dilation were associated with increased apoptosis and fibrosis, while losartan had no effect on the expression of c-kit or Ki-67. Metoprolol or losartan had no effect on microvessel density. These results demonstrate that beta-blocker treatment attenuated adverse remodeling via c-kit+ cells and proliferation, whereas angiotensin receptor blocker-induced worsening of LV systolic function was associated with increased apoptosis and fibrosis in the peri-infarct region.", 
    "689": "For the family physician, NSAIDs, both traditional and cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, are a valuable contribution to managing arthritis and other rheumatological conditions in primary care. Yet, many of the patients seen by the family doctor have complex comorbidities and polypharmacy issues. This review looks at the main considerations for primary-care physicians while choosing an anti-inflammatory treatment for a hypothetical patient case study. In addition to looking at the evidence for gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk, the concomitant use of aspirin with an NSAID is also examined. New evidence for interaction between selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors is reviewed and the interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and NSAIDs is considered. Making careful judgements based on individual needs, medical history and comorbidities is recommended based on the evidence reviewed.", 
    "690": "Chronic kidney diseases share common pathogenic mechanisms that, independently from the initial injury, lead to glomerular hyperfiltration, proteinuria, and progressive renal scarring and function loss. Inhibition of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) has been consistently found to reduce or halt the progressive deterioration of renal function through reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria, the two main determinants of renal function decline. In few instances, RAS inhibition may even promote amelioration of the glomerular filtration rate. Animal data suggest that chronic therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor type I blockers promotes regression of glomerulosclerosis, even in later phases of the disease. In humans, studies investigating the effect of angiotensin II inhibition on renal structural changes have shown inconsistent results, possibly due to small numbers and/or short duration of follow-up. Whether regression of glomerulosclerosis relies on a direct regenerative effect of RAS inhibition or on spontaneous kidney self-repair after the injury has been removed is still unknown. Improved understanding of mechanisms that promote renal regeneration may help in designing specific therapies to prevent the development of end-stage renal disease. This is a desirable goal, considering the economic burden of chronic kidney diseases and their effect on morbidity and mortality.", 
    "691": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most common and most rapidly growing cause of end-stage renal failure in developed countries. Diabetic nephropathy results from complex interactions between genetic, metabolic and hemodynamic factors. Improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrosis associated with diabetic kidney disease have led to the identification of several novel targets for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Albuminuria is a useful clinical marker of diabetic nephropathy, as it can be used to predict a decline in renal function. A reduction in albuminuria might not, however, be reflective of a protective effect of therapies focused on ameliorating renal fibrosis. Although new strategies for slowing down the progression of several types of renal disease have emerged, the challenge of arresting the relentless progression of diabetic nephropathy remains. In this Review, we discuss novel pharmacological approaches that aim to improve the renal outcomes of diabetic nephropathy, including the use of direct renin inhibitors and statins. We also discuss the promise of using antifibrotic agents to treat diabetic nephropathy. The need for novel biomarkers of diabetic nephropathy is also highlighted.", 
    "692": "Angiotensin II and other components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) have a central role in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetic renal disease. A study in patients with type 1 diabetes and overt nephropathy found that RAAS inhibition with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was associated with a reduced risk of progression to end-stage renal disease and mortality compared with non-RAAS-inhibiting drugs. Blood-pressure control was similar between groups and proteinuria reduction was responsible for a large part of the renoprotective and cardioprotective effect. ACE inhibitors can also prevent microalbuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes who are hypertensive and normoalbuminuric; in addition, ACE inhibitors are cardioprotective even in the early stages of diabetic renal disease. Angiotensin-II-receptor blockers (ARBs) are renoprotective (but not cardioprotective) in patients with type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy or microalbuminuria. Studies have evaluated the renoprotective effect of other RAAS inhibitors, such as aldosterone antagonists and renin inhibitors, administered either alone or in combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. An important task for the future will be identifying which combination of agents achieves the best renoprotection (and cardioprotection) at the lowest cost. Such findings will have major implications, particularly in settings where money and facilities are limited and in settings where renal replacement therapy is not available and the prevention of kidney failure is life saving.", 
    "693": "Eliglustat tartrate (Genz-112638), a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, is under development as an oral substrate reduction therapy for Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1). A multinational, open-label, single-arm phase 2 study of 26 GD1 patients (16 female, 10 male; mean age, 34 years) evaluated the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of eliglustat tartrate administered twice daily by mouth at 50- or 100-mg doses based on plasma drug concentrations. Entry criteria required splenomegaly with thrombocytopenia and/or anemia. The composite primary efficacy end point required improvement after 52 weeks in at least 2 of these 3 disease manifestations and was met by 77% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 58%-89%) of all patients and 91% (95% CI = 72%-98%) of the 22 patients completing 52 weeks. Statistically significant improvements occurred in mean hemoglobin level (1.62 g/dL; 95% CI =1.05-2.18 g/dL), platelet count (40.3%; 95% CI = 23.7-57.0 g/dL), spleen volume (-38.5%; 95% CI = -43.5%--33.5%), liver volume (-17.0%; 95% CI = -21.6%-12.3%), and lumbar spine bone mineral density (0.31 Z-score; 95% CI = 0.09-0.53). Elevated biomarkers (chitotriosidase; chemokine CCL18; angiotensin-converting enzyme; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) decreased by 35% to 50%. Plasma glucosylceramide and ganglioside GM3 normalized. Eliglustat tartrate was well tolerated: 7 mild, transient adverse events in 6 patients were considered treatment-related. Individual pharmacokinetics varied; mean time to maximal observed concentration was 2.3 hours and mean half-life was 6.8 hours. Eliglustat tartrate appears to be a promising oral treatment for GD1.", 
    "694": "In this study the ability of various additives to inhibit crystallization of two model drugs, captopril and levonorgestrel, in acrylate and silicone adhesives was investigated. Among the various additives tested, PVP was found to be the most effective in inhibiting the crystallization of both drugs. Incorporation of PVP in patches (PVP stabilized patches) allowed incorporation of both drugs in amounts higher than their respective saturation solubility in pure adhesives (saturated patches). Skin permeation profiles of the drugs from the patches across hairless rat skin were obtained using Franz diffusion cells. For the hydrophilic drug captopril the skin flux over the first 24h was the same for the saturated and PVP stabilized patches, but after 24h the PVP stabilized patches produced higher skin flux values. However this may be because the saturated patch was depleted of the drug after 24h. It is not clear if PVP performs as a solubilizer or a crystallization inhibitor for hydrophilic drugs. For the lipophilic drug levonorgestrel, the skin flux profile from the saturated and PVP stabilized patches was the same, suggesting that PVP acts just as a drug solubilizer and does not produce supersaturation.",

    "699": "Interruption of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers (ARBs), alone or in combination, has become a leading therapeutic strategy to slow down the progression of chronic kidney disease. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of patients progress despite this therapy. New alternative arms are available today to treat hypertension in uncontrolled patients that might have a role in renoprotection. The role of aliskiren, the recently available renin inhibitor may be assumed, based on the pathophysiology of RAAS related renal damage and from data derived on experimental and clinical studies in-patient with type 2 diabetes related nephropathy. The review focuses on the potential consequences of (pro)renin blockade in glomerular hypertension and renal scarring along with some patented treatment methods. The benefit of this additional therapy is still only hypothetical. Ad hoc clinical trials have been conducted to confirm the expected results. Finding that prolonged inhibition of renin vasoconstrictor effect, suppression of plasma renin activity and a more effective RAAS blockade, in patients with chronic RAAS inhibition may help to achieve a sustained reduction of proteinuria, would suggest that renin inhibitors may represent a new weapon to fight progressive nephropathies.", 
    "700": "An HPLC method with DAD detection was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of zofenopril and hydrochlorothiazide in tablets. The separation was carried out through a gradient elution using an Agilent LiChrospher C18 column (250x4.0 mm id, 5 microm) and a mobile phase consisting of (A) water-TFA (99.9:0.1 v/v) and (B) acetonitrile-TFA (99.1:0.1 v/v) delivered at a flow-rate of 1.0 mL/min. 8-Chlorotheophylline was used as internal standard. Calibration curves were found to be linear for the two drugs over the concentration ranges of 5.0-40 and 1.0-20 microg/mL for zofenopril and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively. Linearity, precision, accuracy, specificity and robustness were determined in order to validate the proposed method, which was further applied to the analysis of commercial tablets. The proposed method is simple and rapid, and gives accurate and precise results.",

The starting dose of CyA was 5 mg/kg per day, and the drug level was maintained at 100-200 ng/mL. The mean CyA level was 183.8+/-48.3 ng/mL (range 120.7-276.0 ng/mL) and the mean duration of CyA therapy was 10.9+/-1.9 months (range 8-12 months). After CyA therapy the mean 24 hr urinary protein excretion declined from 107.1+/-35.1 mg/m(2)/hr to 7.4+/-2.4 mg/m(2)/hr (P<0.001) and serum albumin increased from 3.3+/-0.6 g/dL to 4.3+/-0.3 g/dL (P<0.001). At a follow-up biopsy the histological grade of IgAN was improved in seven (50%) of the 14 patients, remained the same in three (21%), and was aggravated in four (29%). Serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, and blood pressure did not differ before and after CyA therapy. Two patients (14%) showed CyA-induced nephrotoxicity at the second biopsy. Our findings indicate that CyA therapy may be effective in reducing proteinuria and regressing renal pathology in a subset of children with IgAN.", 
    "702": "Reactive oxygen species are known to be derived from NADPH oxidase in several tissues. Angiotensin II was suggested to be involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase; however, its role in the gastric mucosa is unclear. We examined the roles of angiotensin II receptor and NADPH oxidase in ischemia/reperfusion-induced gastric damage in rats. Under urethane anesthesia, male Sprague-Dawley rat stomachs were mounted in an ex-vivo chamber, had 100 mM HCl applied to them, and then a catheter was passed through the femoral vein. Ischemia/reperfusion was accompanied by blood collection and reperfusion through the catheter. Losartan, candesartan, valsartan, which are AT1 receptor blockers (ARB); PD123319, an AT2 receptor blocker; enalapril, an ACE inhibitor; or diphenylene iodonium, a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, was given i.v. 10 mins, and beta-NADPH, a NADPH oxidase substrate, was given i.v. 5 mins before reperfusion. The gastric damage by ischemia/reperfusion was attenuated by treatment with any of ARB or enalapril, but was not affected by PD123319. The increase in gastric H(2)O(2) production and microvascular permeability by ischemia/reperfusion was also suppressed by treatment with any of ARB or enalapril. In rat gastric mucosa, the NADPH oxidase subunit p47(phox) was detected. Additionally, diphenylene iodonium had similar effects to ARB against ischemia/reperfusion-caused gastric damage, increased H(2)O(2) production, and microvascular permeability. Ischemia/reperfusion activated NADPH oxidase in the gastric mucosa, and the activation was significantly attenuated by treatment with losartan or diphenylene iodonium. These results suggest that ischemia/reperfusion generated reactive oxygen species are derived from NADPH oxidase activation via AT1 receptor in rat stomachs.", 
    "703": "Adult Brown Norway (BN) rats exhibit numerous internal elastic lamina (IEL) ruptures in the abdominal aorta (AA) and a lower aortic elastin-to-collagen ratio (E/C) compared with other strains. We studied here AA mechanical properties in BN compared with control strains. AA stiffness (assessed by plotting elastic modulus/wall-stress curves obtained under anesthesia), thoracic aorta elastin and collagen contents, and IEL ruptures in AA were measured in male BN and LOU rats aged 6, 10, and 15 wk. The Long Evans (LE) control strain was compared with BN at more advanced ages (15, 28, and 64 wk). At all ages, aortic E/C was lower in BN than in control strains. At 6 wk, AA stiffness was greater in BN than in LOU. In both strains, AA stiffness decreased between 6 and 10 wk, more so in BN than in LOU, and then increased, reaching similar values at 15 wk. BN AA stiffness was not different from that of LE at 15 and 28 wk, but was significantly lower at 64 wk. The increased stiffness in young BN rat AA may be due to the decreased E/C. IEL rupture onset in the BN around 7-8 wk, which decreases stiffness, as suggested by its pharmacological modulation, abolished such differences by 15 wk. Thereafter, age-related AA stiffness increased less in BN than in LE, likely due to the numerous IEL ruptures. We conclude that, in the BN rat, the lower E/C and the presence of IEL ruptures have opposing effects on arterial stiffness.",

    "717": "Amaranth seed proteins have a better balance of essential amino acids than cereals and legumes. In addition, the tryptic hydrolysis of amaranth proteins generates, among other peptides, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory (ACEi) peptides. ACE converts angiotensin I (Ang I) into Ang II, but is also responsible for the degradation of bradykinin (BK). In contrast to Ang II, BK stimulates vasodilation modulated through endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production. The aim of the present study was to characterize the ACEi activity of amaranth trypsin-digested glutelins (TDGs) and their ability to induce endothelial NO production. An IC(50) value of 200microgml(-1) was measured for TDG inhibition of ACE. TDGs stimulated endothelial NO production in coronary endothelial cells (CEC) by 52% compared to control. The effects of TDGs were comparable to those of BK and Captopril, both used as positive controls of NO production. Consistent with these effects, TDGs induced, in a dose-dependent manner, endothelial NO-dependent vasodilation in isolated rat aortic rings. These results suggest that TDGs induce endothelial NO production and consequent vasodilation through their ACEi activity. Amaranth TDGs have a high potential as a nutraceutical food in prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Further molecular, cellular and physiological studies are currently under way and the results may contribute to a better understanding and control of cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "718": "Current homology-modelling methods do not consider small molecules in their automated processes. Therefore, the development of a reliable tool for protein-ligand homology modelling is an important next step in generating plausible models for molecular interactions. Two automated protein-ligand homology-modelling strategies, requiring no expert knowledge from the user, are investigated here. Both employ the \"induced fit\" concept with flexibility in side chains and ligand. The most successful strategy superimposes the new ligand over the original ligand before homology modelling, allowing the new ligand to be taken into consideration during protein modelling (rather than after), facilitating conformational change in the local backbone if necessary. We show that this approach results in successful modelling of the ligand and key binding-site residues of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from its homologue ACE, which is not possible via conventional homology modelling or by homology modelling followed by docking. Several other difficult target complexes are also successfully modelled, reproducing native protein-ligand contacts with significantly different biological substrates and different binding-site conformations. These include the modelling of Cdk5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) from Cdk2, thymidine phosphorylase from a bacterial homologue, and dihydrofolate reductase from a recombinant variant with a markedly different inhibitor. In terms of average modelling quality across 82 targets, the ligand RMSD with respect to the experimental structure is 1.4 A (and 2.0 A for the protein binding site) for \"easy\" cases and 2.9 A for the ligand (and 2.7 A for the protein binding site) in \"hard\" cases. This demonstrates the importance of selecting an optimal template. Ligand-modelling accuracy is strongly dependent on target-template ligand structural similarity, rather than target-template sequence identity. However, protein-modelling accuracy is dependent on both. Our automated protein-ligand homology-modelling strategy generates a higher degree of accuracy than homology modelling followed by docking, generating an average ligand RMSD that is 1-2 A better than docking with homology models.",

To address this issue, the authors examined patterns of antihypertensive medication prescribing among 5668 hypertensive inpatients. Outcomes were treatment with any antihypertensive medication and treatment with first-line therapy, defined as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, or calcium channel blockers. Logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, race, length of stay, service line, and comorbidity were used for all comparisons. The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for treatment were higher for men (1.4, P<.001), older patients (2.5 for age older than 80 vs 1.0 for age younger than 40; P<.001), non-white race (1.2 vs 1.0 for white race; P<.004), and generalist service line (1.4 vs 1.0 for all other services; P<.001). Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for receiving first-line agents were higher for older patients and generalist service line. Among surgical patients, receipt of medical consultation was only marginally associated with higher odds of antihypertensive or first-line treatment after adjustment for relevant clinical variables. Demographic factors and service line appear to play a major role in determining the likelihood of inpatient hypertension treatment. Understanding and addressing these disparities has the potential to incrementally improve hypertension control rates in the population.",

Weight loss in obese individuals has been associated with improved blood pressure control and regression in left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. The authors investigated the impact of comorbidity and medication on clinical and echocardiographic parameters after weight loss in obese patients. Serial echocardiography and clinical data were collected in 62 patients before bariatric surgery and after 6 months or 10% weight loss. Obese patients with diabetes or hypertension had higher baseline LV mass (LVM) (334 + or - 73 g in hypertension and diabetes vs 252 + or - 97 g in hypertension and 219 + or - 75 g in disease-free patients, P = .003; P = .089 for differences in LVM indexed by height), despite the lack of significant differences in body mass index or systolic blood pressure. There were no significant differences in baseline LVM or LVM index related to the medication used to treat hypertension. After weight loss, patients on beta-blocker therapy experienced the most significant LV hypertrophy regression (-76.5 + or - 79.1 g with beta-blockers, -17.8 + or - 43.7 g with diuretics, -4.5 + or - 46.6 g with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and -23.1 + or - 50.9 g in not treated patients, overall P = .538; beta-blockers vs no therapy P < .005; P = .145 for differences in LVM index).

The authors assessed practice patterns of antihypertensive drug utilization and blood pressure (BP) control in a predominantly African American population in Brooklyn, NY, from January 1 to January 31, 2008. A total of 416 (53.1%) had hypertension, with a mean age of 61 years, and 267 (64%) were women. In general, 212 (50.9%) were at goal BP and 59.9% of those at goal were taking at least 2 drugs. Patient age correlated with the number of drugs used (r=0.14; P=.004). Patients taking beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers were older: 63.6 vs 60.1 years (P=.01) and 62.7 vs 60.3 years (P=.07), respectively. The pattern of antihypertensive use was as follows: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 194 (46.6%); calcium channel blockers, 162 (38.9%); diuretics, 162 (38.9%); beta-blockers, 133(32%); and angiotensin receptor blockers, 93 (22.4%). The findings of age associated with the class of medications used and a predominance of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors usage highlight possible gaps in appropriateness of antihypertensive therapy. The application of age-appropriate race-based antihypertensive therapy might improve BP control rates. These results strengthen arguments for investing in community-based programs to overcome possible provider-related and local health system barriers to achieving BP control goals.",

The boundary between \"timely\" and \"late\" presentation in STEMI, the appropriateness of percutaneous intervention in patients presenting late after onset of symptoms, and the impact of sex and age on the eligibility and/or choice of reperfusion therapy continue to be challenged by the most recent published data. In the current invasive-driven reperfusion era, if scientific evidence and clinical guidelines are applied diligently, the vast majority of eligible STEMI patients should receive reperfusion therapy. Pharmacological nonlytic therapy of patients with STEMI, regardless of the choice of reperfusion strategy or the absence of it, is clearly defined by the current practice guidelines. Available data suggest that for patients who do not receive any form of reperfusion, anticoagulation therapy with low molecular weight heparin provides a clear additional mortality benefit versus placebo. Fondaparinux as compared with usual care (unfractionated heparin infusion or placebo) significantly reduces the composite of death or myocardial reinfarction without increasing severe bleeding or number of strokes. In the treatment of late-presenting patients with STEMI (beyond the first 12 h after onset of symptoms), clinical evaluation and risk stratification represent the crucial elements helping in decision making between therapeutic interventions.",

We used a rat strain with low levels of kallikrein (LKR) that was more sensitive to ICV cadmium hypertension, compared with normal kallikrein rats (NKRs), the control strain. The interplay between the kallikrein-kinin system and the RAS in the LKR strain caused various hemodynamic alterations, which we believe were the result of elevated RAS activity in these animals. Moreover, we suggest that the defective kallikrein-kinin system in LKR may also cause an alteration in the activation of brain RAS in these animals. The LKR displayed elevated concentrations of plasma AII, hypertrophy of the myocardium, and initial alterations in the renal glomerulotubular system. With the exception of clonidine, all of the other drugs showed greater antihypertensive effects of differing statistical significance in LKR, compared with NKR. Both ACE inhibitors were able to significantly reduce pressor response to cadmium ICV in LKR throughout the experiment, whereas in NKR, they were only able to reduce the hypertensive peak of cadmium. A significant protective effect was also observed in LKR pretreated with saralasin, while no effect was observed in NKR. These findings confirm the presence of brain RAS activation in LKR and its contribution to the central control of pressor response to cadmium ICV.",

The sustained release of captopril from floating matrices has been studied varying the antioxidant load, the sodium bicarbonate proportion and the compaction pressure. Although in many cases the effect of compaction pressure remains hidden, actual results show that matrices compacted at 55 MPa have smaller density and float in the dissolution medium while those compacted at 165 MPa float only adding sodium bicarbonate. The increase of compaction pressure reduces the hydration volume and increases the time necessary to attain its maximum. These changes are attributed to lower matrix porosity and to the consequent diminution of water and drug transport. Increasing ascorbic acid proportions increase the matrix hydration volume and the drug released. The use of sodium ascorbate and the substitution of 15% polymer with sodium bicarbonate reduce the matrix hydration volume, shorten the matrix hydration process and increase the drug released. This is attributed to carbon dioxide bubbles that decrease the matrix coherence and expand the matrix volume, facilitating drug dissolution and only a limited further matrix expansion. The antioxidant protection provided by sodium ascorbate was lesser of that of ascorbic acid because of greater molecular mass and lesser release rate.",

In this study, we investigated the kinin forming capacity of OSCS and OSCS contaminated heparin when incubated in vitro with a pool of human plasma. At 100 microg/mL, OSCS liberates BK in a profile similar but not identical to dextran sulfate, a well known activator of the plasma contact system. The results have highlighted that the quantity of BK accumulated during contact system activation depends not only on the concentration of OSCS but also on the plasma dilution and the presence of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. We demonstrate a highly significant correlation between the concentration of OSCS present in the contaminated heparin and BK released concentration.

In cardiomyocytes, Gq activates only one splice variant of one subtype of phospholipase Cbeta, specifically phospholipase Cbeta1b (PLCbeta1b) and PLCbeta1b is responsible for Gq mediated hypertrophic and apoptotic responses. PLCbeta1b targets to the sarcolemma via its unique C-terminal sequence and its activation can be inhibited by expressing the C-terminal sequence to compete for sarcolemmal binding. Inhibition of PLCbeta1b by the C-terminal peptide reduces hypertrophic responses in cardiomyocytes.

Beta-blockers should be used to treat hypertension in patients with previous myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, after coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and in patients who are pregnant, have thyrotoxicosis, glaucoma, migraine, essential tremor, perioperative hypertension, or an excessive blood pressure response after exercise.", 
    "757": "The use of beta-blockers as first-line therapy in patients with primary hypertension has been controversial. However, the 2009 guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension state that large-scale meta-analyses of available data confirm that diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and calcium channel blockers do not significantly differ in their ability to lower blood pressure and to exert cardiovascular protection both in elderly and in younger patients.", 
    "758": "The key message of this paper is that atenolol should not be used as an antihypertensive drug and that the degree of reduction of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke and congestive heart failure by antihypertensive therapy is dependent on the degree of lowering of aortic blood pressure. Newer vasodilator beta-blockers such as carvedilol and nebivolol may be more effective in reducing cardiovascular events than traditional beta-blockers, but this needs to be investigated by controlled clinical trials.", 
    "759": "Insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease cluster together, and the incidence of all of these disease states is increasing throughout the world. Current strategies for hypertension management-including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, and thiazide diuretics-are effective for most patients. However, as the incidence of hypertension increases in this target population, so does that of resistant hypertension. As such, significant research and effort must be put forth to bring blood pressure to goal and delay or prevent target organ damage. Such efforts should frequently include a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine. Other agents that are currently underused in this population for the treatment of resistant hypertension include nebivolol, carvedilol, aliskiren, and aldosterone antagonists. Finally, significant potential is seen for darusentan, an endothelin antagonist, if it comes to market.", 
    "760": "In some controlled therapeutic trials for hypertension, a selective reduction of systolic blood pressure has been obtained with long-term treatment. The greatest effects on cardiovascular outcomes stem from a decrease of central blood pressure through a significant reduction of arterial stiffness, wave reflections, or both. Until now, all protocols have used angiotensin II blockade, mainly through angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. Cardiovascular outcomes have been significantly improved when compared with controls, but most of them have been treated with beta blockers. Such \"de-stiffening\" therapies are important to consider and require additional trials.", 
    "761": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are indispensable therapeutic agents for treating hypertension and proteinuria in patients with diabetes mellitus. Studies have shown that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has effects on various organ systems, including the central nervous system, heart, and kidneys. Angiotensin II has major deleterious effects on vascular compliance, vascular relaxation, and plasma markers of inflammation, which are surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease. Evidence is established from major trials that ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy improve these surrogate markers and reduce cardiovascular disease, renal disease, and stroke. Accumulating evidence also supports the newer class of medication, the direct renin inhibitor aliskiren, as beneficial in hypertensive persons with diabetes mellitus. In this article, we review the mechanisms through which inhibitors of the RAAS benefit persons with hypertension and decrease the development of cardiovascular and renal disease above and beyond blood pressure lowering.", 
    "762": "The renin-angiotensin system has been a target in the treatment of hypertension for close to three decades. Several medication classes that block specific aspects of this system have emerged as useful therapies, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and, most recently, direct renin inhibitors. There has been a natural history to the development of each of these three drug classes, starting with their use as antihypertensive agents; thereafter, in each case they have been employed as end-organ protective agents. To date, there has been scant evidence to favor angiotensin receptor blockers or direct renin inhibitors over angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in treating hypertension or in affording end-organ protection; thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remain the standard of care when renin-angiotensin system blockade is warranted.", 
    "763": "Regardless of the mechanisms that initiate the rise of blood pressure, the development of structural changes in the systemic vasculature is the end result of established hypertension. Indices of small resistance artery structure, such as the ratio of tunica media to internal lumen, may have a strong prognostic significance in hypertensive patients, over and above all other known cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, the regression of vascular alterations seems to be an appealing goal for antihypertensive treatment. Different antihypertensive drugs may have different effects on vascular structure. Complete normalization of small resistance artery structure was demonstrated in hypertensive patients after long-term and effective antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists. Little or no improvement was observed with beta-blockers or diuretics. Evidence from several studies suggests that some antihypertensive drugs are more effective than others in reversing microvascular structural alterations in hypertension.", 
    "764": "Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular condition in adults. It is also very common in athletes. When lifestyle changes fail, medications may be needed for the treatment of hypertension. When choosing a drug for antihypertensive therapy, providers should choose an agent that has favorable effects on blood pressure and minimal detrimental hemodynamic change during exercise. Evidence supports that the medications with the most favorable effects are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, alpha-blockers, and cardiac-selective beta-blockers. The effects of diuretics are less desirable, and nonselective beta-blockers should be a last choice for hypertensive patients who are physically active.", 
    "765": "Hypertension is a prevalent disease worldwide. Its inadequate treatment leads to major cardiovascular complications, such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. These conditions decrease life expectancy and are a substantial cost burden to health care systems. Physically active individuals and professional athletes are not risk free for developing this condition. Although the percentage of persons affected is substantially lower than the general population, these individuals still need to be thoroughly evaluated and blood pressure targets monitored to allow safe competitive sports participation. Regarding treatment, lifestyle modification measures should be routinely emphasized to athletes and active individuals with the same importance as for the general population. Medication treatment can be complicated because of restrictions by athletic organizations and possible limitations on maximal exercise performance. In addition, the choice of an antihypertensive drug should be made with consideration for salt and water losses that routinely occur in athletes, as well as preservation of exercise performance and endothelial function. First-line therapies for athletes and physically active individuals may be different from the general population. Some authorities believe that blocking the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is more beneficial compared with diuretics because of ACE inhibitors and ARBs being able to avoid salt and water losses. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are another reasonable choice. Despite effects on heart rate, nondihydropyridine CCBs do not appear to impair exercise performance. beta-Blockers are not used as a first-line therapy in athletes because of effects on exercise and prohibition by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and World Anti-Doping Agency in certain sports. In this article, we address the evidence on hypertension and its related treatments in active individuals to provide recommendations that allow the best competitive sports results and reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "766": "The purpose of this first prospective observational cohort study after launch was to document the efficacy and tolerability of therapy with the fixed combination of lercanidipine HCl (CAS 132866-11-6), a third-generation calcium antagonist, and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril maleate (CAS 76095-16-4) in patients with essential hypertension in daily practice. Both parts of the observational study were conducted with the fixed combination of enalapril maleate 10 respectively 20 mg and lercanidipine HCl 10 mg, one part with Zaneril and the other with Zanipress. The fixed combination is marketed under these product names in Germany. The data of 8,440 patients with a mean age of 62 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m2 were evaluated. 84% of the patients had already received pre-treatment for essential hypertension. 26% of all the patients were known to have had hypertension for at least 10 years. Around 70% had further concomitant diseases. The mean blood pressure before the beginning of the study was 162.5/ 94.5 mmHg, the mean reduction after around three months was 28.4/ 13.5 mmHg. Just under 80% of the patients reached the desired target blood pressure after the observation period. The global assessment of the physicians shows that the efficacy of the drugs was \"very good\" to \"good\" for 94% of the patients. Global tolerability was assessed as \"very good\" and \"good\" for 97% of the patients. Compliance was stated as \"very good\" and \"good\" for 97% of the patients. Adverse drug reactions were documented for 2% of all patients.", 
    "767": "The converting enzyme catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Ang II is the key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system, regulating water-electrolyte balance in newborn calves. Captopril is an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of captopril-induced reduction of convertase activity on copper and iron concentrations of blood plasma in calves. The experiment was carried out on 10 Holstein-Friesian female calves, during the first week of life. Copper and iron concentrations in blood plasma were examined before and after captopril administration (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after giving the inhibitor) on subsequent days of the experimental period. The results demonstrated that the copper concentration of blood plasma increased with age. On the seventh day, the copper concentration stabilised at the level observed in adult cattle. Measured before captopril administration, the iron concentration in blood plasma changed: the highest iron concentration was observed on the first day of life, which was followed by a decrease on the third day, and thereafter an increase on the seventh day. These changes may significantly influence the neonatal adaptation of newborn calves, particularly hemopoiesis efficiency. Captopril did not cause statistically significant changes in plasma copper concentration in calves. However, the reduction of angiotensin convertase activity induced by captopril administration resulted in a drop of plasma iron concentration, observed already within 1-2 hours after administration of the inhibitor, and especially within two days post partum. The results indicate that an efficient mechanism maintaining a constant concentration of selected minerals may involve changes in the reabsorption of these minerals from the system fluids to tissues.", 
    "768": "We describe a case of marked swelling of the tongue in a patient after a long prone position neurosurgery, who was treated for hypertension with alacepril. The tongue was not congestive and history of taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor suggested an alacepril-induced angioedema. The day after surgery, the patient's tongue was still swollen; however, fibrescopic observation of the larynx and pharynx through the nasal cavity revealed that the edema was limited to anterior tongue, and the oral cavity and oropharynx were not involved. Although, tongue angioedema was observed, we introduced a 3-mm tube exchanger to the patient's trachea and removed the endotracheal tube. The ventilation and oxygenation were maintained, and 30 min later, the exchanger was detached. On the second postoperative day, the angioedema disappeared completely and the patient was transferred to a ward without any complication.", 
    "769": "Aliskiren is an orally active direct renin inhibitor which inhibits the synthesis of angiotensin I by linking to active renin on a deep cleft of its molecular structure, the site of hydrolysis of the Leu10-Val11 bond of angiotensinogen. At variance with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, aliskiren eliminates the main substrate for the 'escape' phenomenon (synthesis of angiotensin II from angiotensin I through alternative enzymatic pathways). The possibility that the antihypertensive effect of aliskiren differs from that of ACE inhibitors needs to be proved in specifically designed clinical trials. Over the past 2 years, three studies have been published which directly compared aliskiren with ramipril, in patients with hypertension. We made a pooled analysis of these studies. In order to avoid interference with additional drugs, analysis was restricted to trial periods when the two drugs were given as monotherapy. In each individual study, systolic blood pressure (BP) was slightly lower with aliskiren. Overall, systolic BP was lower with aliskiren than with ramipril (weighted mean difference between the treatments 1.84 mmHg; fixed effect model; p < 0.0001; and 1.87 mmHg; random effect model; p = 0.0055). The standardized mean difference between the treatments was 2.58 (fixed effect model; p < 0.0001) and 2.92 (random effect model; p = 0.0017) in favor of aliskiren. Compared with ramipril, aliskiren may have induced a more complete 'upstream' inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, with consequent greater suppression of angiotensin II. Another potential explanation may be the longer terminal elimination halflife of aliskiren (about 40 hours) compared with ramiprilat (13-17 hours). These data provide further evidence that aliskiren monotherapy provides a sustained BP reduction over the 24 hours.", 
    "770": "Calcified aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a prevalent condition, affecting 25% of people older than 65 years. CAVD and atherosclerosis share common risk factors and pathogenic mechanisms. Nevertheless, they present different pathologic lesions. The main factors involved in the pathogenesis of CAVD are genetic predisposition, the process of valvular calcification, deposition of lipoproteins, and chronic inflammation. Studies have suggested a potential benefit from early treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers, and particularly with statins. Observational studies on risk factors for the CAVD, and randomized clinical trials on primary and secondary prevention in subjects with high risk for the disease, would be necessary to improve the clinical management of CAVD.",

All family physicians in Ontario, Canada were randomly allocated to receive the Toolkit, which includes several printed educational materials targeting CVD screening, prevention and treatment, either in spring 2009 (intervention arm) or in spring 2010 (control arm). Randomization occurred at the level of the practice. Forty family physicians from each arm will be recruited to participate, and the medical records for 20 of their diabetic patients at high risk for CVD will be retrospectively reviewed. Outcome measures will be assessed for each patient between July 2009 and March 2010. The primary outcome will be that the patient is receiving a statin. Secondary outcomes will include 1) the receipt of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 2) various intermediate measures (A1c, blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, total-/HDL-cholesterol ratio, body mass index and waist circumference), and 3) clinical inertia (the failure to change therapy in response to an abnormal A1c, blood pressure or cholesterol reading). The analysis will be carried out using multilevel hierarchical logistic regression models to account for the clustered nature of the data. The group assignment will be a physician-level variable. In addition, a process evaluation study with six focus groups of family physicians will assess the acceptability of the CDA's Toolkit and will explore factors contributing to any change or lack of change in behaviour, from the perspectives of family physicians.",

    "774": "The intraorgan renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of a variety of diseases and has been implicated in fibrogenesis. The role of RAS in the development of chronic pancreatitis is not well established. The blockade of RAS in rat models with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) blockers (ARBs) mostly have reduced pancreatic inflammation and fibrosis with a few exceptions. At the same time, the use of ACEi and ARBs in humans is associated with a modest risk of acute pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of the AT1 signaling pathway in the development of pancreatitis using AT1a- and AT1b-deficient mice as well as the ARB losartan. Chronic pancreatitis was induced by repetitive cerulein administration in C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and AT1a- and AT1b-deficient mice (AT1a-/- and AT1b-/-), and pancreatic injury was assessed at day 10. Pancreatic weight of cerulein treated groups was significantly reduced. There was severe parenchymal atrophy and fibrosis assessed by histological examination. Fibrosis was accompanied by activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSC) evaluated by Western blot analysis for alpha-smooth muscle actin. No differences were seen between cerulein-treated WT, AT1a-/- , AT1b-/- mice, or losartan treated-WT mice with regards to morphological or molecular alterations induced by cerulein. Our results demonstrate that AT1a and AT1b receptor pathways do not seem to be essential for the development of pancreatitis in the mouse model of pancreatitis induced by repetitive cerulein injury.",

The authors reviewed 563 patients with HF and an ejection fraction <or=35% for adherence to the 2005 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF guidelines for the use of ICDs, CRT, and medications. There were 324 HFC and 239 GC patients. CRT guidelines were appropriately followed in 86% of HFC and 81% of GC patients ( P=NS). For primary arrhythmia prevention, an ICD was implanted in 107 (42%) HFC and 50 (25%) GC patients ( P<.004). Guidelines were appropriately followed in 77% of HFC and 74% of GC patients ( P=NS). For medications, dose intensity of diuretics, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was significantly greater in HFC than GC patients.

However, cardiac myocyte hypertrophy attenuation triggered by angiotensin-(1-9) was not modified with the simultaneous administration of the angiotensin-(1-7) receptor antagonist A779 (100 ng/kg per min, n = 6). In experiments in vitro with cultured cardiac myocytes incubated with norepinephrine (10 micromol/l) or with insulin-like growth factor-1 (10 nmol/l), angiotensin-(1-9) also prevented hypertrophy.

    "788": "The use of racial/ethnic labeling for any purpose is fraught with substantial emotional, social and political consequences even when used for demographic studies or census. In addition to the very real historical conflicts associated with slavery in the Americas and various social classification systems elsewhere, such labeling has been shown by the use of ancestral identification markers to be inaccurate in many cases. Even geographic labeling, such as East Asians, ignores the marked heterogeneity of East Asians. The use of race alone to determine selection of initial antihypertensive therapy is a very limited approach. The Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Antihypertensive Agents has demonstrated, however, that the use of age and race together may be a useful paradigm for predicting response to a single antihypertensive drug. Furthermore, individuals from populations who consume high levels of sodium and lower levels of potassium may respond better to diuretics and calcium antagonists. Other populations may be more susceptible to angioedema or cough related to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Such information may be useful for the selection or avoidance of certain medications. No patient should ever be denied indicated treatment with a drug or drug class because of race or ethnicity.", 
    "789": "The treatment of moderate or severe hypertension in most cases requires the contemporaneous use of multiple antihypertensive agents. The most available two-drug combinations have an agent that addresses renin secretion and another one that is statistically more effective in renin-independent hypertension. The practice of combining agents that counteract different mechanisms is the most likely explanation for the fact that most available two-drug combinations have an agent that addresses renin secretion (beta-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker or direct renin inhibitor) and another one that is more effective in renin-independent hypertension (diuretic, dihydropyridine or non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker). Based on these considerations, addition of hydrochlorothiazide to the combination of an antagonist of the renin-angiotensin system with a calcium channel blocker would constitute a logical approach. Inclusion of a diuretic in the triple combination is based on the evidence that these agents are effective and cheap, enhance the effect of other antihypertensive agents, and add a specific effect to individuals with salt-sensitivity of blood pressure. The benefit of triple combination therapy with amlodipine, valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide over its dual component therapies has been demonstrated, and the use of a single pill will simplify therapy resulting in better blood pressure control.", 
    "790": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition can reduce stroke risk by up to 43% in humans and reduce the associated disability, and hence understanding the mechanism of improvement is important. In animals and humans, these effects may be independent of the blood pressure-lowering effects of ACE inhibition. Normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)) and hypertensive (spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)) animals were treated with the ACE inhibitors ramipril or lisinopril for 7 or 42 days before 2 hours of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Blood pressure, serum ACE, and blood glucose levels were measured and stroke infarct volume was recorded 24 hours after stroke. Despite greater reductions in blood pressure, infarct size was not improved by ACE inhibition in hypertensive animals. Short-term ACE inhibition produced only a modest reduction in blood pressure, but WKY rats showed marked reductions in infarct volume. Long-term ACE inhibition had additional reductions in blood pressure; however, infarct volumes in WKY rats did not improve further but worsened. WKY rats differed from SHR in having marked cortical ACE activity that was highly sensitive to ACE inhibition. The beneficial effects of ACE inhibition on infarct volume in normotensive rats do not correlate with changes in blood pressure. However, WKY rats have ACE inhibitor-sensitive cortical ACE activity that is lacking in the SHR.",

Blood pressure (BP) control in stage 2 hypertension with aliskiren monotherapy has not been reported. This was a post hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients with stage 2 systolic hypertension (baseline mean sitting systolic BP [msSBP]\u2265160 mmHg) who completed the 12-week monotherapy phase of a 6-month, double-blind, randomized study. A total of 175 patients were randomized to aliskiren 150 mg (n = 88) or ramipril 5 mg (n = 87) with optional up-titration to aliskiren 300 mg or ramipril 10 mg, respectively, at weeks 6 and 12. In the subgroup of patients with stage 2 systolic hypertension, aliskiren lowered msSBP and mean sitting diastolic BP (msDBP) by 22.3/12.7 mmHg from baseline to week 12; compared with a reduction of 18.1/10.2 mmHg with ramipril. The maximum BP reductions achieved with aliskiren were 60.0/34.0 mmHg (from a baseline of 172.7/107.3 mmHg). Aliskiren was noninferior (P < 0.0001) to ramipril for SBP reduction with nonsignificant superiority (P = 0.052), and superior (P = 0.043) to ramipril for DBP reduction. The proportion of patients who achieved BP control (<140/90 mmHg) after 12 weeks of monotherapy was larger with aliskiren (34/88, 38.6%) than with ramipril (22/87, 25.3%; P = 0.038). In this post hoc analysis, 12 weeks of monotherapy with aliskiren 150-300 mg provided effective mean BP reductions (22/13 mmHg) and was superior to ramipril 5-10 mg in controlling BP in patients with stage 2 systolic hypertension.", 
    "792": "The precise mechanisms explaining the anti-hypertensive effects produced by quercetin are not fully known. Here, we tested the hypothesis that chronic quercetin treatment inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). We examined whether quercetin treatment for 14 days reduces in vivo responses to angiotensin I or enhances the responses to bradykinin in anaesthetised rats. We measured the changes in systemic arterial pressure induced by angiotensin I in doses of 0.03-10 \u03bcg/kg, by angiotensin II in doses of 0.01-3 \u03bcg/kg, and to bradykinin in doses of 0.03-10 \u03bcg/kg in anaesthetised rats pre-treated with vehicle (controls), or daily quercetin 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 14 days, or a single i.v. dose of captopril 2 mg/kg. Plasma ACE activity was determined by a fluorometric method. Plasma quercetin concentrations were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. Quercetin treatment induced no significant changes in the hypertensive responses to angiotensin I and angiotensin II, as well in the hypotensive responses to bradykinin (all p>0.05). Conversely, as expected, a single dose of captopril inhibited the hypertensive responses to angiotensin I and potentiated the bradykinin responses (all p<0.01), while no change was found in the vascular responses to angiotensin II (all p>0.05). In addition, although we found significant amounts of quercetin in plasma samples (mean=206 ng/mL), no significant differences were found in plasma ACE activity in rats treated with quercetin compared with those found in the control group (50\u00b16 his-leu nmol/min/mL and 40\u00b17 his-leu nmol/min/mL, respectively; p>0.05). These findings provide strong evidence indicating that quercetin does not inhibit ACE in vivo or in vitro and indicate that other mechanisms are probably involved in the antihypertensive and protective cardiovascular effects associated with quercetin.",

Hypertensive patients, as well as those receiving therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, presented with significantly enhanced plasma NGAL concentrations when compared to normotensive (p=0.0341) patients and those not treated (p=0.0004). Enhanced NGAL concentrations did not meet statistical significance for patients with advanced stenosis grade (p=0.0971) or a history of peripheral artery disease (p=0.0827). Multiple regression analysis identified homocysteine, creatinine, eGFR and treatment with ACE inhibitors (p=0.0019, <0.00001, 0.0005 and 0.0219, respectively) as independent predictors of NGAL concentration.",

    "797": "Although accelerated atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis are the main causes of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, the molecular pathogenesis remains largely obscure. Our study of the aortic function in a typical CKD model of subtotal nephrectomy (SNX) rats demonstrated phenotypes that resemble CKD patients with aortic stiffness. The 2-DE analysis of rat aortas followed by MS identified 29 up-regulated and 53 down-regulated proteins in SNX rats. Further Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses validated the decreased HSP27 and increased milk fat globule epidermal growth factor-8 (MFG-E8) in SNX rats. Functional classification of differential protein profiles using KOGnitor revealed that the two major categories involved in aortic stiffness are posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones (23%) and cytoskeleton (21%). Ingenuity Pathway Analysis highlighted cellular assembly and organization, and cardiovascular system development and function as the two most relevant pathways. Among the identified proteins, the clinical significance of the secreted protein MFG-E8 was confirmed in 50 CKD patients, showing that increased serum MFG-E8 level is positively related to aortic stiffness and renal function impairment. Drug interventions with an inhibitor of the angiotensin converting enzyme, enalapril, in SNX rats improved aortic stiffness and decreased MFG-E8 depositions. Together, our studies provide a repertoire of potential biomarkers related to the aortic stiffness in CKD.",

However, a thorough clinical examination is absolutely necessary. In fact, even in the absence of a PHACE syndrome, large haemangiomas can induce important complications. In the present brief report we describe a case of left ventricular dilatation in a 6-month-old girl due to a giant facial haemangioma. Left ventricular dilatation has been evaluated by two-dimensional echocardiography. Studies to identify other major arteriovenous malformations were negative. Medical therapy with diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and steroids was able to halt the progression towards left ventricular dysfunction, avoiding an early surgical approach for a disease that very often is self-limiting.",

The glomerulonephritis in MRL-Fas(lpr) mice is mediated by autoantibodies and autoreactive lymphocytes. To investigate the effect of combination therapy by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) for lupus nephritis, we treated MRL-Fas(lpr) mice with imidapril, pravastatin or both agents. Compared with other groups, the mice treated by combination therapy survived longer and showed a significant reduction in proteinuria, renal pathology, including glomerular IgG deposit, and serum anti-DNA Ab. Furthermore, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) in the kidney was reduced significantly in the combination therapy group, compared with that in the control group. We conclude that combination therapy with ACEI and statin for MRL-Fas(lpr) mice significantly alleviates autoimmune renal disorder and prolongs survival. These results suggest that combination therapy by ACEI and statin may represent a new approach to the treatment of patients with lupus.",

Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that significant independent prognostic factors for appropriate ICD shocks were smoking (odds ratio 3.7) and statins (odds ratio 0.54). The significant independent prognostic factors for inappropriate ICD shocks were atrial fibrillation (odds ratio 6.2) and statins (odds ratio 0.52). Finally, those for the interval to mortality were age (hazard ratio 1.08/1-year increase), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (hazard ratio 0.25), atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio 4.1), right ventricular pacing (hazard ratio 3.6), digoxin (hazard ratio 2.9), hypertension (hazard ratio 5.3), and statins (hazard ratio 0.32). In conclusion, in patients with heart failure and ICDs, smoking increased and statins reduced appropriate ICD shocks, atrial fibrillation increased and statins reduced inappropriate ICD shocks, and the interval to mortality was increased by age, atrial fibrillation, right ventricular pacing, hypertension, and digoxin and reduced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and statins.",

We examined the association between ACEI treatment and mortality in a large, unselected population of patients with AMI. The present study included 105,224 patients with AMI who were not treated with ACEIs on admission. A logistic regression analysis, including 33 variables, calculated a propensity score for each patient to estimate the probability of receiving ACEIs at discharge, given the background. The association between ACEI treatment at discharge and the 1-year outcome was evaluated in prespecified subgroups using the Cox regression analyses, adjusting for the propensity score and medications at discharge. A total of 38,395 patients (36.5%) received ACEIs at discharge. After adjustment, ACEI treatment was associated with a 24% reduction in mortality (relative risk 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 0.80). The benefit was largest in patients with a history or present signs of heart failure. In patients without heart failure, a significant benefit of ACEI treatment was seen only in patients with renal dysfunction (relative risk 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.88). In the whole group, the risk of AMI decreased by 7% (relative risk 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.96), with a larger effect seen in patients with ST-segment elevation AMI or systolic left ventricular dysfunction. In conclusion, in unselected patients with AMI, ACEI treatment was associated with a reduction in 1-year mortality, mainly in patients with heart failure or renal dysfunction, and a small reduction in the risk of reinfarction, mainly in patients with ST-segment elevation AMI or systolic left ventricular dysfunction.",

    "811": "Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). The pathogenesis of CHF remains undefined. Several recent studies suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is an important mediator of progressive hepatic fibrosis through activation of profibrotic mediators, such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). RAS activation has not previously been studied in patients with CHF or in animal models. The aim of the present study was to characterize RAS expression during the course of CHF in the PCK rat.",

Expression of the RAS components, renin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), as well as the profibrotic mediator TGF-beta, was examined in cystic PCK and control rat livers at 2, 4, and 6 months of age by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Angiotensin II (ANG II) was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Fibrosis was assessed by IHC using reticulin staining and Masson trichrome.

In 4- and 6-month-old PCK rat livers, ACE gene expression was markedly increased, 8- and 17-fold, respectively, compared with age-matched control livers. Expression of the other RAS components, renin, angiotensinogen, and AT1R were not significantly different. IHC demonstrated prominent ANG II protein expression in periportal regions in PCK rats. In contrast, no expression was noted in control livers. TGF-beta expression was also increased in PCK rat livers with progressive disease.", 
    "814": "The present study demonstrates, for the first time, RAS upregulation in an orthologous rat ARPKD/CHF model. Increases in ACE and ANG II, as well as the downstream target, the profibrotic mediator TGF-beta, suggest that RAS activation may be an important mediator of CHF disease progression. The findings also suggest that treatment with RAS inhibitors, specifically ACE inhibitors or AT1R blockers, could be therapeutic in slowing disease progression in CHF.",

Much less recognition exists for the role of the renin-angiotensin system in regulating erythropoiesis, a biological function critical for oxygen delivery to tissues. In this review, we present evidence that angiotensin II (Ang II) is a physiologically important regulator of erythropoiesis with 2 key actions. First, Ang II is a growth factor of erythroid progenitors and, in cooperation with erythropoietin, increases red blood cell mass. Second, Ang II acts as an erythropoietin secretagogue to maintain increased erythropoietin levels despite increments in hematocrit. Among a multitude of physiologic and pathophysiologic implications, these lines of evidence provide an explanation for the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and Ang II type 1 receptor blockers to decrease hematocrit or cause anemia in various clinical conditions.",

Primary reperfusion was used less often among elderly (age>75 years) patients than among those aged 65-74 and <65 years (46%, 63%, 64%, respectively, p (for trend)=0.004). Class-I evidence-based medications (EBM) at discharge (aspirin, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors=ACEI, angiotensin receptor-blockers=ARBs and statins) were less frequently prescribed to elderly compared to younger age-subgroup (44%, 61%, 57%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio (OR)=0.62; 0.40-0.97 for age \u2265 75 vs. age<65 years). Early and 1-year mortality rates were 3-5-fold higher among the elderly compared to patients <65 years. In the entire cohort use of primary reperfusion was associated with lower 1-year mortality (OR=0.69; 0.47-1.01), as was the use of EBM (OR=0.26; 0.17-0.41). These effects were similar across all age-subgroups but with a greater impact among the elderly, as the number of patients needed to treat (NNT) was significantly lower with advancing age.

To support the safety, Lowpept has been examined in an acute and in a 4-week repeated dose oral toxicity studies in rats. Powdered casein hydrolysate administered in a single oral gavage dose of 2000 mg/kg resulted in no adverse events or mortality. Also, casein hydrolysate administered as a daily dose of 1000 mg/kg for 4 weeks by gavage resulted in no adverse events or mortality. No evidence or treatment-related toxicity was detected during both studies. Data analysis of body weight gain, food consumption, clinical observations, blood biochemical, haematology, organ weight ratios and histopathological findings did not show significant differences between control and treated groups. It is concluded that the casein hydrolysate containing the peptides RYLGY and AYFYPEL orally administered to rats was safe and that not treatment-related toxicity was detected even at the highest doses investigated in both acute (2000 mg/kg of body weight) and repeated dose (4 weeks) oral (1000 mg/kg of body weight) toxicity studies.", 
    "826": "Chagas heart disease (CHD), caused by Trypanosoma cruzi infection, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South and Central America. Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is an important drug used to ameliorate heart functional capacity and its remodelling in individuals presenting CHD. In this study, we evaluated the effects of enalapril on systemic and cardiac immune response during experimental acute CHD. C57BL/6 mice infected with 50 trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi (Colombian strain) were treated daily with enalapril (25 mg/kg) and, after 30 days, a reduction in seric levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, CCL5/RANTES and nitric oxide, but not in that of IL-10, was detected. This imbalance of cytokines reflects in a reduction of heart mononuclear infiltration and in an increasing of cardiac mast cells. Enalapril also presents a new and interesting in vitro and in vivo anti-T. cruzi activity probably acting on parasite oxidative pathway via cytochrome-P450. Our data show that enalapril exerts an important anti-T. cruzi and anti-inflammatory activity during acute CHD reducing inflammatory cells and, possibly, preventing fibrotic process in the chronic phase. Nevertheless, further studies are still necessary to clarify the mechanisms by which this drug is acting on the parasites and on the immune pathways.",

The sequences LVYPFTGPIPN, HLPLP, IAK, YAKPVA and WQVLPNAVPAK showed a clear decrease in SBP and DBP in SHR. HPHPHLSF caused a significant decrease of the DBP in the SHR, but this sequence did not modify the SBP of these animals in a significant manner. KKYNVPQL did not modify SBP in the SHR, and caused a slight, but significant and maintained, decrease in DBP in these animals.

    "829": "Angiotensin II converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) presumably stimulate renin secretion by interrupting angiotensin II feedback inhibition. The increase in cytosolic calcium caused by activation of Gq-coupled AT1 receptors may mediate the renin-inhibitory effect of angiotensin II at the cellular level, implying that ACEI and ARB may work by reducing intracellular calcium. Here, we investigated whether angiotensin II blockade acts predominantly through Gs-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) by testing the effect of ACEI and ARB in mice with juxtaglomerular cell-specific deficiency of the AC-stimulatory Gsalpha. The ACEI captopril and quinaprilate and the ARB candesartan significantly increased plasma renin concentration (PRC) to 20 to 40 times basal PRC in wild-type mice but did not significantly alter PRC in Gsalpha-deficient mice. Captopril also completely abrogated renin stimulation in wild-type mice after co-administration of propranolol, indomethacin, and L-NAME. Treatment with enalapril and a low-NaCl diet for 7 days led to a 35-fold increase in PRC among wild-type mice but no significant change in PRC among Gsalpha-deficient mice. Three different pharmacologic inhibitors of AC reduced the stimulatory effect of captopril by 70% to 80%. In conclusion, blockade of angiotensin II stimulates renin synthesis and release indirectly through the action of ligands that activate the cAMP/PKA pathway in a Gsalpha-dependent fashion, including catecholamines, prostaglandins, and nitric oxide.",

For each therapy, the proportion of patients with contraindications was significantly higher with increasing patient risk (P<0.001 for each). Even after excluding those with contraindications, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers was significantly lower with increasing risk (P<0.001 for each).", 
    "847": "The use of evidence-based therapies is lower in patients with heart failure at higher risk of mortality both because of higher rates of contraindications to therapy and lower rates of use among eligible patients. Optimizing heart failure outcomes will require both the expansion of the evidence base for treating the highest-risk patients as well as the development of effective strategies to assure that eligible high-risk patients receive all appropriate therapies.", 
    "848": "Since most lupus nephritis patients have an incomplete response to mycophenolate mofetil, combination regimens may improve outcomes. Tacrolimus (FK506) has shown some benefit in lupus nephritis in small trials, and combined with mycophenolate mofetil is standard immunosuppression in transplant patients. We investigate the addition of FK506 to mycophenolate mofetil, in patients who were mycophenolate mofetil failures. All patients were part of a prospective cohort, but evaluated retrospectively. Seven lupus nephritis patients (mean age 27.1, 100% female, 42% Caucasian and 42% African American) were evaluated. Three patients had combined ISN class III and V, two ISN class IV, one ISN class V and II and one ISN class IV and V. Six were taking an ACE-inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, 6 hydroxychloroquine and 5 prednisone (mean dose 11.5 mg; range 0-30 mg). Mean mycophenolate mofetil dose at time of tacrolimus addition was 2.8 g (range 2-3 g). Mean tacrolimus dose was 3.4 mg (range 2-8 mg) titrated to a mean level of 4.67 ng/dl (range 2.2-11.8 ng/dl) for a mean of duration of 16 months (range 2-54 months). Two patients continued both therapies, while five discontinued therapy. One patient achieved a complete renal remission, while three achieved partial remission with 82.9%, 77.1%, 55.3% reductions in proteinuria. Toxicity limited the use of combination therapy: diabetic ketoacidosis (one patient), pneumonia (two) and muscle pain (two). These data suggest that adding tacrolimus in patients refractory to mycophenolate mofetil might have some benefit, although complete responses were rare. Unfortunately, tacrolimus toxicity appeared to be prevalent in these systemic lupus erythematosus patients, limiting its long term use.",

Efficacy of these agents was also shown when they were administered to patients with left ventricular dysfunction and signs and symptoms of CHF early after acute myocardial infarction. It is not known whether the selective aldosterone antagonist eplerenone can improve outcomes in mildly symptomatic patients. The Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization And SurvIval Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS-HF) was designed to evaluate the effect of eplerenone on mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic systolic HF in NYHA class II. Methods Approximately 3100 patients with ejection fraction < or =30% and estimated glomerular filtration rate > or =30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) will be recruited. Patients are randomized 1:1 to double-blind eplerenone or placebo in addition to standard chronic HF therapy.

However, the effects of ARBs vary based on their unique pharmacologic properties. In this study, we focused on telmisartan, a fat-soluble ARB with selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR gamma) agonist activity, and investigated its effects on ischemic injury in cerebral vasculature using murine models of both transient and permanent focal ischemia. Analysis by triphenyltetrazolium-staining revealed that pre-treatment of mice with telmisartan reduced stroke volume 72 h after the transient ischemic insult in a dose-dependent manner, though such treatment did not reduce stroke volume due to permanent ischemia. Transient ischemia induced pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1 and P-selectin in the ischemic region, and treatment with telmisartan diminished the expression of these adhesion molecules with diminished infiltration of inflammatory cells. The beneficial effect of telmisartan was attenuated, in part, by administration of a PPAR gamma antagonist. Treatment with valsartan (an ARB without PPAR gamma agonist activity) also decreased ischemic injury after transient ischemia, though to a lesser extent than telmisartan. Our findings indicate that telmisartan has a beneficial effect in a murine model of ischemia/reperfusion injury through blockade of AT1 receptors, and, in addition, due to a positive effect via its specific anti-inflammatory PPAR gamma agonist activity.", 
    "852": "Recent research provided important insights into the development of atrial fibrillation (AF)-maintaining substrate and suggested targeting of the underlying molecular mechanisms, 'upstream' of the electrical aspects of AF, as a novel strategy for AF treatment ('upstream' therapy). Upstream therapies for AF include drugs targeting the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT(1) receptor antagonists and aldosterone antagonists), statins, steroids and omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil). Aldosterone causes volume retention, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and systemic inflammation and coagulation that promote AF development and its complications and blockade of aldosterone receptors with spironolactone or eplerenone suppresses inducible AF. Although the clinical impact of spironolactone treatment requires validation in randomized clinical trials in AF patients, further understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which aldosterone causes atrial remodelling is likely to lead to development of novel therapeutic approaches to AF.",

The 2010 Canadian Cardiovascular Society HF guidelines update focuses on an increasing issue in the western world - HF in ethnic minorities - and in an uncommon but important setting - the pregnant patient. Additionally, due to increasing attention recently given to the assessment of how care is delivered and measured, two critically important topics - disease management programs in HF and quality assurance - have been included. Both of these topics were written from a clinical perspective.

The data were provided by the internal data warehouse of Hauptverband der Osterreichischen Sozialversicherungstr\u00e4ger. Total costs in Euros were used for the analysis to facilitate comparisons with earlier studies.", 
    "860": "There was appreciable utilization of fixed-dose diuretic combinations at between 36 and 38% of all renin-angiotensin products, in line with expectations. The reduction in expenditure/defined daily dose for originator and generic ACEis and their combinations is, again, in line with expectations, mirroring earlier findings for proton pump inhibitors and statins. ARB utilization was just under 27% of all renin-angiotensin products. This is higher than the low utilization rates seen with atorvastatin following its prescribing restrictions, and may reflect the difficulties if restrictions are based on subjective criteria. ARB utilization rates were lower or similar to other countries, who have implemented a different range of demand-side reforms to limit their prescribing with the advent of generic ACEis.",

Two-dimensional (2-D) strain imaging is increasingly used to quantify LV torsion in the clinical setting. Telmisartan has cardioreparative effects, including attenuation of subendocardial myocardial fibrosis and improvement of LV remodelling. To clarify the mechanisms of LV torsion, in the present study, we evaluated changes in LV longitudinal deformation and torsion after medication with telmisartan using 2-D strain imaging in patients with hypertension (HT).",

Two-dimensional strain echocardiography was performed after medication had been continued for 1-2 months with normal values for blood pressure (BP) (phase I) and for 12 months (phase II). In the phase II, relative LV wall thickness, LV mass index, LV torsion, and torsional rate were reduced, whereas the mean peak systolic longitudinal strain and strain rate were increased, compared to the phase I. LV torsion correlated well with relative LV wall thickness, but not LV mass index.",

    "869": "Chronic kidney disease is a common disorder and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. Early diagnosis on the basis of presence of proteinuria or reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate could permit early intervention to reduce the risks of cardiovascular events, kidney failure, and death that are associated with chronic kidney disease. In developed countries, screening for the disorder is most efficient when targeted at high-risk groups including elderly people and those with concomitant illness (such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease) or a family history of chronic kidney disease, although the role of screening in developing countries is not yet clear. Effective strategies are available to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular risk. Treatment of high blood pressure is recommended for all individuals with, or at risk of, chronic kidney disease. Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers is preferred for patients with diabetic chronic kidney disease or those with the proteinuric non-diabetic disorder. Glycaemic control can help prevent the onset of early stages of chronic kidney disease in individuals with diabetes. Use of statins and aspirin is beneficial for most patients with chronic kidney disease who are at high cardiovascular risk, although research is needed to ascertain how to best prevent cardiovascular disease in this cohort. Models of care that facilitate delivery of the many complex aspects of treatment simultaneously could enhance management, although effects on clinical outcomes need further assessment. Novel clinical methods to better identify patients at risk of progression to later stages of chronic kidney disease, including kidney failure, are needed to target management to high-risk subgroups.",

Local RAS of CRC metastases differed from the surrounding liver, with lower angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression but increased ANG-(1-7) receptor (MasR) compared to the liver. The AT1R localised to cancer and stromal infiltrating cells, while other RAS receptors were detected in cancer cells only. Tumor induction led to an initial increase in AT1R and ACE expression while captopril treatment significantly increased ACE expression in the final stages of tumor growth. Conversely, captopril treatment decreased expression of AT1R and angiotensinogen.",

Inappropriate activation of the RAAS is important in hypertension-induced cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renin is the rate-limiting step in the RAAS cascade, which makes direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) an attractive target for RAAS suppression and treatment of hypertension. Current regimens using either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) result in feedback upregulation of renin and aldosterone breakthrough, which contribute to incomplete suppression of the RAAS. Thereby, aliskiren - alone or in combination - might offer a novel therapeutic intervention to improve suppression of the RAAS, with potential to translate to improved CVD and CKD outcomes.",

    "878": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce blood pressure and attenuate cardiac and vascular remodeling in hypertension. However, the kinetics of remodeling after discontinuation of the long-term use of these drugs are unknown. Our objective was to investigate the temporal changes occurring in blood pressure and vascular structure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Captopril treatment was started in the pre-hypertensive state. Rats (4 weeks) were assigned to three groups: SHR-Cap (N = 51) treated with captopril (1 g/L) in drinking water from the 4th to the 14th week; SHR-C (N = 48) untreated SHR; Wistar (N = 47) control rats. Subgroups of animals were studied at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after discontinuation of captopril. Direct blood pressure was recorded in freely moving animals after femoral artery catheterism. The animals were then killed to determine left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and the aorta fixed at the same pressure measured in vivo. Captopril prevented hypertension (105 + or - 3 vs 136 + or - 5 mmHg), LVH (2.17 + or - 0.05 vs 2.97 + or - 0.14 mg/g body weight) and the increase in cross-sectional area to luminal area ratio of the aorta (0.21 + or - 0.01 vs 0.26 + or - 0.02 microm(2)) (SHR-Cap vs SHR-C). However, these parameters increased progressively after discontinuation of captopril (22nd week: 141 + or - 2 mmHg, 2.50 + or - 0.06 mg/g, 0.27 + or - 0.02 microm(2)). Prevention of the development of hypertension in SHR by using captopril during the prehypertensive period prevents the development of cardiac and vascular remodeling. Recovery of these processes follows the kinetic of hypertension development after discontinuation of captopril.",

Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of continuous vs. interval exercise training on arterial stiffness and blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Sixty-five patients with hypertension were randomized to 16 weeks of continuous exercise training (n=26), interval training (n=26) or a sedentary routine (n=13). The training was conducted in two 40-min sessions a week. Assessment of arterial stiffness by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were performed before and after the 16 weeks of training. At the end of the study, ABPM blood pressure had declined significantly only in the subjects with higher basal values and was independent of training modality. PWV had declined significantly only after interval training from 9.44+/-0.91 to 8.90+/-0.96 m s(-1), P=0.009 (continuous from 10.15+/-1.66 to 9.98+/-1.81 m s(-1), P=ns; control from 10.23+/-1.82 to 10.53+/-1.97 m s(-1), P=ns).

Many animal studies, including our own, and a few human studies suggest that mineralocorticoid receptor blockade could inhibit the ongoing renal damage in chronic kidney disease. Thus, we designed this double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the antialbuminuric effect of a low dose (50 mg day(-1)) of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eplerenone. The study subjects will include 340 hypertensive patients (blood pressure: 130-180/80-100 mm Hg) with albuminuria (urinary albumin/creatinine ratio: 30-600 mg g(-1) in the first morning void urine), who are treated with an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system. Other classes of antihypertensive drugs may be added as needed to achieve the target blood pressure (<130/80 mm Hg). The primary study end point is the change in the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio after a 1-year study period. This trial is expected to show whether a low dose of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can exert an antialbuminuric effect in patients with chronic kidney disease.",

AGE-induced RAGE expression, as well as other molecules, including membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), was NADPH oxidase signaling-dependent and blunted by temocaprilat and olmesartan. The parameters of plaque instability, including MMP-9 expression and activity, and apoptosis were up-regulated by AGE, which was markedly attenuated by temocaprilat or olmesartan. Using isolated human monocyte culture, AGE-induced ROS generation and molecular expression were also attenuated by RAS blockade.",

Changes in MMP-9, LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume index (LVEDVI and LVESVI) after 12 months were assessed. Overall, MMP-9 significantly decreased, although neither LVEDVI nor LVESVI increased significantly. DeltaMMP-9 was significantly correlated with DeltaLVEDVI (r=0.36) or DeltaLVESVI (r=0.39). In comparison, across groups, it was found that MMP-9, LVEDVI and LVESVI at 12 months were significantly lower in the combination therapy group than in the trandolapril group. There were no significant differences between the valsartan group and combination therapy group, or between the valsartan group and the trandolapril group.",

No difference between the groups was found with respect to residual renal function (RRF) at the start for both groups by the end of follow up, decreased in the vast majority of patients from both groups (P = 0.014). After 12 months, a significant difference in ultrafiltration was found between the two groups: in the control group it had decreased, while it had not changed in the ACE/ARB group (P < 0.05). In comparison with the baseline level, expression of fibronectin, TGF-beta1 and VEGF in dialysate effluent were significantly increased except for AQP1 in the control group (P < 0.05), but not in the ACE/ARB group (P > 0.05).",

Therefore, etiology and pathophysiology of the underlying disease and its hemodynamic conditions are indispensable. This applies to coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, the cardiomyopathies with and without inflammation, and microbial persistence similarly. The classic treatment algorithms both in heart failure with and without reduced ejection fraction are based on measures onloading the heart (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin antagonists, beta-blockers, diuretics) and on antiarrhythmics and anticoagulation, when needed. Device therapy for cardiac resynchronization in left bundle branch block and permanent stimulation therapy may contribute to the hemodynamic benefit. ICD (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) therapy prevents sudden cardiac death, which is often associated with progressive heart failure. Heart transplantation and left ventricular assist devices are final options in the treatment repertoire of terminal heart failure.",

    "894": "Two independent reviewers searched and abstracted randomized controlled trials of ARBs and ACE inhibitors compared to ACE inhibitor therapy alone in patients with heart failure reporting mortality and hospitalizations having a follow-up of at least 6 months identified by a systematic literature search. Eight trials including a total of 18,061 patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. There was no difference between patients treated with combination therapy and ACE inhibitor therapy alone for overall mortality, hospitalization for any reason, fatal or nonfatal MI. Combination therapy was, however, associated with fewer hospital admissions for heart failure (RR 0.81, 95%CI 0.72-0.91), although there was significant heterogeneity across trials (p-value for heterogeneity = 0.04; I(2) = 57% [95%CI 0-83%]). Patients treated with combination therapy had a higher risk of worsening renal function and symptomatic hypotension, and their trial medications were more often permanently discontinued. Lack of individual patient data precluded the analysis of time-to-event data and identification of subgroups which potentially benefit more from combination therapy such as younger patients with preserved renal function and thus at lower risk to experience worsening renal function or hyperkalemia.",

    "896": "The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to abolish the risks associated with blood pressure (BP) elevation without adversely affecting quality of life. Drug selection is based on efficacy in lowering BP and in reducing cardiovascular (CV) end points including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Although the choice of initial drug therapy exerts some effect on long-term outcomes, it is evident that BP reduction per se is the primary determinant of CV risk reduction. Available data suggest that at least 75% of patients will require combination therapy to achieve contemporary BP targets, and increasing emphasis is being placed on the practical tasks involved in consistently achieving and maintaining goal BP in clinical practice. It is within this context that the American Society of Hypertension presents this Position Paper on Combination Therapy for Hypertension. It will address the scientific basis of combination therapy, present the pharmacologic rationale for choosing specific drug combinations, and review patient selection criteria for initial and secondary use. The advantages and disadvantages of single pill (fixed) drug combinations, and the implications of recent clinical trials involving specific combination strategies will also be discussed.", 
    "897": "Hypertension affects most hemodialysis patients and is often poorly controlled. Adequate control of blood pressure is difficult with conventional hemodialysis alone but is important to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Nonpharmacologic interventions to improve blood pressure include educating patients about limiting sodium intake, ensuring adequate sodium solute removal during hemodialysis, and achieving target \"dry weight.\" However, most patients require a number of antihypertensive medications to achieve an appropriate blood pressure. First-line antihypertensive agents include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers given their safety profile and demonstrated benefit on cardiovascular outcomes in clinical trials. beta-blockers and combined alpha- and beta-blockers should also be used in patients with cardiovascular disease or congestive heart failure and may improve outcomes in these populations. Calcium channel blockers and direct vasodilators are also effective for controlling blood pressure. Many blood pressure agents can be dosed once daily and should preferentially be administered at night to control nocturnal blood pressure and minimize intradialytic hypotension. In patients who are noncompliant with therapy, renally eliminated agents (such as lisinopril and atenolol) can be given thrice weekly following hemodialysis. Older antihypertensive agents which require thrice daily dosing ought to be avoided given the high pill burden with these regimens and the concern for noncompliance resulting in rebound hypertension. Newer antihypertensive agents, such as direct renin inhibitors, may provide alternative options to improve blood pressure but require testing for efficacy and safety in hemodialysis patients.",

Several manifestations of systemic sclerosis, including Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulceration, scleroderma renal crisis and pulmonary arterial hypertension, contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality and are understood to share similarities in their underlying vasculopathy. In recent years, a number of treatment options have become available that ease the burden of these manifestations, including calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, prostanoids and prostacyclin analogs, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors. Several of these treatments have demonstrated beneficial effects against more than one complication, as a result of the similarities in the pathology underlying these manifestations. However, physicians involved in the management of patients with systemic sclerosis are faced with differing levels of evidence supporting these treatments, and historically little international consensus on the treatment of some manifestations, such as digital ulcers. The aim of this article is to evaluate the level of evidence supporting each intervention in systemic sclerosis, thereby facilitating decision-making in the clinic.", 
    "899": "Physical fitness is closely related to cardiovascular health. We examined the effects of estradiol, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, exercise training, and their combination on exercise capacity as well as skeletal muscle fiber type and capillarity in old female rats. Twelve-month-old female Wistar-Kyoto rats were allocated to six groups: control (C), treatment with 17 beta-estradiol (0.025 mg/kg/dose, i.p. twice a week) (Est), perindopril (2 mg/kg/day) (Per), exercise training on a treadmill (15 m/min, 10 grade incline, 60 min/day, 5 days/week) (Exe), and combinations of a drug and exercise training (Exe+Est and Exe+Per). Following 6-month interventions, the rats were submitted to a stepwise exercise test on a treadmill. Moreover, fiber type and capillarity in both the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were examined. Exercise capacity, capillary density, and the percentage of type I fiber significantly increased in Exe, Exe+Est, and Exe+Per compared to C. There were no significant differences in exercise capacity, capillary density, and percentage of type I fiber among C, Est, and Per. The combination of exercise training and perindopril further increased capillary density in both the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, and the percentage of type I fiber in the gastrocnemius muscle compared to exercise training alone. We found that in old female rats, chronic treatment with estradiol or perindopril affected neither untrained exercise capacity nor exercise capacity acquired as a result of exercise training. However, we found that perindopril promotes adaptive changes of skeletal muscle in response to exercise such as increases in capillary density and the percentage of type I fiber.",

The group of bioactive peptides most studied up until now are the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) peptides, which, when administered orally, seem to possess the capacity to lower blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. The various techniques of separation, identification, and classification of bioactive peptides obtained from milk and milk products, permit the selection of molecules with the highest level of health benefits to be used as a functional ingredient in the production of milk products with blood pressure-lowering effects such as Evolus((R)) or Calpis((R)). This review focuses on the major research in the areas of isolation, identification, and application of bioactive peptides with ACEI activity in milk proteins, paying special attention to in vitro, in animal model systems, and in clinical studies of hypertensive patients.", 
    "901": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), angiotensin II type I receptor (ATIR) antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) were explored to block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The experimental results were still not satisfactory, mainly due to excessive level of angiotensin II (AngII) in gene expression. RNA interference (RNAi) is a mature gene blocking technique, able to block target gene expression efficiently, specifically and continuously. In this study, we observed the effect of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression vectors targeting rat AngII on collagen synthesis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). According to rat AngII gene sequences, three AngII targeted shRNA expression vectors were designed and constructed. Using liposomes as transfection reagents, they were transfected into HSC-T6 cells. Enzyme digestion confirmed that the transfected shRNA target gene segment was successfully cloned to the vectors. Compared with the control group, AngII mRNA expression examined in shRNA1, shRNA2 and shRNA3 groups was inhibited by about 37, 30 and 61%, respectively. AngII protein expression in all three groups was also reduced by about 21, 24 and 59%, respectively. Furthermore, we revealed that the inhibitory effect exhibited a dose- and time-dependent relationship. In shRNA3 group, TGF-beta1 mRNA expression was reduced by about 51%. The levels of PIIIP, HA and LN were decreased by about 53, 47 and 58%, respectively. In conclusion, shRNA expression vectors targeting rat AngII can decrease collagen synthesis, which would hopefully serve as a foundation for RNAi study of liver fibrosis in vivo.",

    "903": "Patients enrolled in our national myocardial infarction (MI) registry between January 2000 and September 2005 with diagnosis of NSTEMI were retrospectively analysed. The study endpoint was the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in the patients at 1 year.", 
    "904": "A total of 1353 patients (62.2% male) with NSTEMI were studied. The mean age of men was 62 +/- 14 versus 72 +/- 12 years in women in the cohort (P <0.001). The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes mellitus were significantly higher in women. Men were more likely to undergo revascularisation than women (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 2.18-3.89, P <0.001). Among those who were revascularised, there was no gender difference in survival or recurrent MI rates during hospitalisation and at 1 year. Compared to medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was associated with a significant reduction in MACE in both women (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.95) and men (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 4.79-12.75).

    "906": "Angiotensin (Ang) II plays a critical role in cardiovascular homeostasis and neuroendocrine regulation. Little is known about whether central angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is functional in the fetal brain. We investigated cardiovascular and neuroendocrinological responses to intracerebroventricular (icv) application of Ang I in the chronically prepared near-term ovine fetus in utero and examined the action sites marked by c-fos expression in the fetal hypothalamus. ACE mRNA was detected in the specific central areas. Intracerebroventricular Ang I significantly increased fetal blood pressure and c-fos expression in the supraoptic nuclei (SON) and the paraventricular nuclei (PVN) in the hypothalamus, accompanied by an increase of fetal plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP). Double labeling demonstrated that AVP neurons in the fetal SON and PVN were expressing c-fos. Captopril, an inhibitor of ACE, significantly suppressed fetal pressor responses and plasma AVP. Double labeling experiments showed colocalization of AT(1) receptor (AT(1)R) and c-fos expression in both SON and PVN following icv Ang I. The results indicate that central endogenous ACE has been functional at least at the last third of gestation and the endogenous brain renin-angiotensin system-mediated pressor responses and AVP release via AT(1)Rs by acting at the sites consistent with the cardiovascular network in the hypothalamus.",

Morbidity and mortality are similar to HF with reduced EF (HFrEF), yet therapies with unequivocal benefit in HFrEF have not been shown to be effective in HFpEF. Recent studies have shown that the pathophysiology of HFpEF, initially believed to be due principally to diastolic dysfunction, is more complex. Appreciation of this complexity has shed new light into how HFpEF patients might respond to traditional HF treatments, while also suggesting new applications for novel therapies and strategies. In this review, we shall briefly review the pathophysiologic mechanisms in HFpEF, currently available clinical trial data, and finally explore new investigational therapies that are being developed and tested in ongoing and forthcoming trials.", 
    "908": "In addition to being responsible for the majority of absorption of dietary nitrogen, the mammalian proton-coupled di- and tri-peptide transporter PepT1 is also recognised as a major route of drug delivery for several important classes of compound, including beta-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Thus there is considerable interest in the PepT1 protein and especially its substrate binding site. In the absence of a crystal structure, computer modelling has been used to try to understand the relationship between PepT1 3D structure and function. Two basic approaches have been taken: modelling the transporter protein, and modelling the substrate. For the former, computer modelling has evolved from early interpretations of the twelve transmembrane domain structure to more recent homology modelling based on recently crystallised bacterial members of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Substrate modelling has involved the proposal of a substrate binding template, to which all substrates must conform and from which the affinity of a substrate can be estimated relatively accurately, and identification of points of potential interaction of the substrate with the protein by developing a pharmacophore model of the substrates. Most recently, these two approaches have moved closer together, with the attempted docking of a substrate library onto a homology model of the human PepT1 protein. This article will review these two approaches in which computers have been applied to peptide transport and suggest how such computer modelling could affect drug design and delivery through PepT1.",

In group 1, they were given fosinopril with propranolol, in group 2 fosinopril with cytomack. Mean age of group 1 and 2 patients was 57.8 +/- 2.1 and 56.9 +/- 23 yr respectively. All the patients were hospitalized within 6 hr after onset of the disease and received heparin. They underwent PETG and echoCG, also studied were endotoxicosis (PSD), central hemodynamics, left ventricular systolic functions (ESV, EDV, EF), size of MI (total ST, AST, total Rh), and clynical symptoms. It was shown that patients working in environmentally unfriendly conditions were characterized by high degree of PSD. In group 1 they exhibited reduction of PSD, total ST, AST, ESV, EDV and increase of total Rh and EF. Decreased systolic and diastolic AP did not lead to clinically significant hypotension. Patients of group 2 showed stabilization of AP, decrease of PSD, total ST, AST, ESV, EDV and increase of total Rh and EF that prevented the development of cardiac insufficiency in the phase of stationary rehabilitation of MI. Characteristics of groups 1 and 2 were not significantly different. The clinical course of IM in patients given fosinopril with cytomack was more favourable than in those treated with fosinopril and propranolol. Two patients of group 1 suffered cardiac insufficiency.", 
    "911": "Identifying patients at high risk for the occurrence of atrial fibrillation is one means by which subsequent thromboembolic complications may be prevented. Left atrial enlargement is associated with progression of atrial remodeling, which is a substrate for atrial fibrillation, but impaired atrial pump function is also another aspect of the remodeling. Our objective was to differentiate patients with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using echocardiography. We studied 280 hypertensive patients (age: 66+/-7 years; left ventricular ejection fraction: 65+/-8%), including 140 consecutive patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and 140 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Left atrial volume was measured using the modified Simpson method at both left ventricular end systole and preatrial contraction and was indexed to body surface area. Peak late-diastolic mitral annular velocity was measured during atrial contraction using pulsed tissue Doppler imaging as an atrial pump function. Left atrial volume index measured at left ventricular end systole had a 74% diagnostic accuracy and a 71% positive predictive value for identifying patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; these values for the ratio of left atrial volume index at left ventricular end systole to the peak late-diastolic mitral annular velocity were 82% and 81%, respectively, and those for the ratio of left atrial volume index at preatrial contraction to the peak late-diastolic mitral annular velocity were 86% and 90%, respectively. In conclusion, left atrial size combined with atrial pump function enabled a more accurate diagnosis of a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation than conventional parameters.",

    "913": "The study was conducted on a random sample of Polish primary-care doctors working in clinics contracted by the national health insurance funds. Doctors completed a questionnaire consisting of eight case vignettes describing patients with elevated blood pressure. The cases differed on three variables relating to the level of blood pressure, the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, and the presence or absence of other risk factors. Doctors were asked to give their treatment decision for each case. Demographic data and details of the doctor's practice were also collected. Treatment decisions were tabulated, and associations between doctor and patient characteristics and treatments were assessed.", 
    "914": "One hundred twenty-five doctors (65% response rate) completed the questionnaire. Compliance with treatment guidelines was judged to be 51%. Poor compliance with guidelines was noted for patients with diabetes mellitus. The level of blood pressure was the strongest predictor of drug treatment. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the most frequently prescribed medications. Appropriate decisions were associated with practice in large cities.",

    "916": "Our laboratory has reported that manipulations that provoke a robust sodium appetite (e.g., sodium depletion, deoxycorticosterone acetate) decrease lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation (LHSS) reward if rats are denied access to hypertonic saline solutions. The following studies investigated the interaction between chronic sodium appetite and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on LHSS reward. In Experiment 1, animals treated with the diuretic furosemide (20 mg/kg) when denied access to saline exhibited an increase in the current required to produce 50% of the maximum LHSS response rate (ECu50) 48 hr after extracellular volume depletion. Furosemide-depleted rats that were allowed to drink 0.3 M saline after depletion, or that were treated with the selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone, which significantly reduced sodium appetite, did not show ECu50 changes. In Experiment 2 chronic intracerebroventricular administration of the selective MR antagonist RU 28318 (10 microg/microl/hr) prevented decreases in the ECu50 induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate-no salt treatment. We conclude that an unresolved sodium appetite will reduce responding for rewards and that experimental manipulations that reduce sodium appetite (e.g., access to saline or blockade of MR) decrease hedonic deficits.",

    "930": "Although antihypertensive drugs currently used provide significant decreases in blood pressure and improve clinical results, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are not sufficiently decreased; therefore, there is still a need for new approaches to the treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. However, when a new blood-pressure lowering therapy is introduced, the question of whether this will be superior over other drug classes in terms of its advantages in hypertensive patients is frequently asked. In 1898, Tigerstedt and Bergman discovered \"renin\" as a consequence of an observation of blood-pressure elevation following the injection of rabbit renal extracts to rabbits; however, the first member of the renin system pharmacology, ACE inhibitors, could be developed in 1970's. This was followed by the development of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) and, during the last 30 years, it has been shown that the pharmacologic blockage of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) improves the prognosis in hypertensive patients. It has been shown that renin system is the key system in the treatment of hypertension and related comorbidities and that the drugs which target renin system, such as ACE inhibitors and ARB, reduce the cardiovascular events to a large extent. In contrast, as the inhibition of angiotensin II (Ang II) production and effect prevents the negative feedback which helps Ang II to inhibit the renin release from the kidney, elevated Ang II levels suggest that renin enzyme, which can be considered to be the center of renin system, can be the optimal tool in the treatment. Aliskiren, which is the first oral direct renin inhibitor developed based on these ideas, was approved by the FDA in March 2007. During all this period, clinical studies have shown that aliskiren is as efficient as other antihypertensive drugs, and preclinical studies have shown that, in genetically modified rats, aliskiren is efficient in healing the cardiovascular damage associated with Ang II. The fact that the plasma renin activity (PRA), which increases with other antihypertensive therapies and is associated with increased cardiovascular complications, decreases with the use of direct renin inhibitors raises the question as to whether aliskiren may provide additional benefit in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The ASPIRE HIGHER program designed to find an answer to this question includes several studies which investigate how aliskiren impacts the clinical results. The studies AVOID, ALOFT and ALLAY, which were completed within the ASPIRE HIGHER program, showed that aliskiren had beneficial effects for surrogate markers of cardiovascular and renal diseases, while AGELESS study showed that, in elderly with systolic hypertension, aliskiren (150 or 300 mg) provided a higher blood pressure lowering compared to ramipril (5 or 10 mg). In addition, many studies included in this program are ongoing and the results of these studies will provide more information about direct renin inhibition. Potential effects of RAS in cognitive functions and the functions of its different components such as angiotensin and AT4 receptor are the topics which are still awaiting answers.", 
    "931": "Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system has a detrimental effect on the progression of renal failure in patients with chronic kidney disease. Drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers have been shown to slow the progression of kidney disease in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic renal diseases. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor that blocks the renin-angiotensin system at its initial step. Several experimental studies have demonstrated the renoprotective effects of aliskiren. Aliskiren, added to standard therapy, shows additional and significant antiproteinuric effects in patients with diabetic nephropathy. The optimal therapeutic approach to patients with target organ damage will be better understood as the ongoing large clinical studies with direct renin inhibitors conclude.", 
    "932": "The inhibition of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has an effect beyond reducing blood pressure in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases; it also reduces mortality and morbidity. Although the classic RAS blockage is effective, due to blockage of negative feedback inhibition, it increases plasma renin activity and as a result generates a residual cardiovascular risk. Different from ACE-i and ARB treatments, aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, is the only pharmacologic agent that noticeably reduces the plasma renin activity, an independent cardiovascular risk factor. This creates a new option in RAS blockage. The efficacy and safety of aliskiren in the treatment of hypertension has been well established. The effect of aliskiren on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity is being researched. At this point there are many experimental and clinical studies to answer questions on this subject.", 
    "933": "After discovery of the first direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, which blocks the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the first rate limiting step, in addition to angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB), renin has become an important target nowadays. The scope of this review is to give a detailed information regarding renin which has an important regulatory function in the body. It is crucial to understand renin and related structures in order to understand its functions in the organ systems. It is for sure that the ongoing trials will enlighten us more regarding the beneficial effects of renin inhibition in terms of morbidity and mortality.", 
    "934": "The primary aim of the treatment in hypertension is to prevent cardiovascular complications. All hypertensives reduce the risk for cardiovascular events by providing effective blood pressure control. Besides blood pressure-lowering effect, the contribution of an antihypertensive agent to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events at high-risk patients was first demonstrated in 2000 in the HOPE study (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation), which used an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril 10 mg (N Engl J Med 2000;342:145-53). However, at the time the results of this study appeared, the use of angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARB) was gaining popularity in the treatment of hypertension as an alternative to ACE inhibitors. This raised the question as to whether an ARB would also offer benefit comparable to that derived from ramipril. A non-inferiority trial was planned by the same research group to test whether telmisartan 80 mg was as effective as ramipril 10 mg in a similar patient population. In order to obtain reliable results, 25,000 patients from all over the world had to be followed-up for five years (Am Heart J 2004;148:52-61). The results of the ONTARGET study (The Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) which were presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in March 2008 were suggestive of a new indication for telmisartan. In August, 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported that a new indication might be justified for the use of telmisartan, an angiotensin-receptor blocker: In order to reduce the risk for cardiovascular diseases and if an ACE inhibitor (ramipril 10 mg) cannot be used, telmisartan 80 mg can be used in patients with a high cardiovascular risk profile (Press announcements, FDA). The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the course of this recent development in cardiovascular protection.",

Patients were categorized according to estimated glomerular filtration rate into 4 groups: normal (>or=90 mL/min), mild (60-89 mL/min), moderate (30-59 mL/min), and severe CRI (<30 mL/min). Patients' characteristics and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events in the 4 groups were analyzed.", 
    "937": "Of 6518 consecutive patients with ACS, 2828 (43%) had mild CRI, 1304 (20%) had moderate CRI, and 345 (5%) had severe CRI. In CRI groups, patients were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. On admission, these patients had a higher resting heart rate and frequently had atypical and delayed presentations. Compared with the normal estimated glomerular filtration group, CRI groups were less likely to receive antiplatelet drugs, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins and were less likely to undergo coronary angiography. In-hospital heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and major bleeding episodes were significantly higher in all CRI groups. In multivariate analysis, mild, moderate, and severe CRI were associated with a higher adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death (mild: OR, 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.7; moderate: OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 3.9-11.5; and severe: OR, 12.0; 95% CI, 6.6-21.7).",

    "939": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients often have sympathetic hyperactivity, which contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular organ damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) reduce sympathetic hyperactivity. Ideally, treatment should eliminate the relation between sympathetic activity and organ damage. The aim of the present study is firstly to compare left ventricular mass (LVM) of CKD patients using chronic ACEi or an ARB with LVM of controls. Secondly, we determine whether previously found muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and arterial blood pressure during follow-up are predictive for the presence of increased LVM. Methods. We restudied 20 CKD patients and 30 healthy volunteers matched for age. Sympathetic nerve activity was quantified by the microneurography (MSNA). Arterial blood pressure was the mean of office blood pressure measurements. LVM was quantified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast.", 
    "940": "The period between MSNA and MRI measurements was 9 \u00b1 3 years. All patients were treated according to guidelines with an ACEi or an ARB. In CKD patients, mean systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 129 \u00b1 10 and 84 \u00b1 5 mmHg, respectively, during follow-up. In patients, as compared to controls, LVM was 93 \u00b1 16 versus 76 \u00b1 18 g, LVM index 30 \u00b1 5 versus 24 \u00b1 4 g/m(2.7) and mean wall thickness 11 \u00b1 2 versus 9.0 \u00b1 1 mm (all P < 0.01). Moreover, MSNA was related to LVM (r = 0.65, P < 0.002), LVM index (r = 0.46, P < 0.03) and LV mean wall thickness (r = 0.84, P < 0.001). Conclusions. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that measures of LVM in CKD patients are greater than in healthy controls, despite a well-controlled blood pressure in the patients. Moreover, there is a positive relationship between these measures of LVM and MSNA, assessed years before, despite a standard antihypertensive treatment. These results support the notion that additional sympatholytic therapy could be beneficial.", 
    "941": "It has been postulated that fetal vascular abnormalities in aryl hydrocarbon receptor null (ahr(-/-)) mice may alter cardiovascular homeostasis in adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that blood pressure regulation in adult heterozygous mice (ahr(+/-)) would be normal, compared to ahr(-/-) mice, since no vascular abnormalities have been reported in the heterozygote animals. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was measured using radiotelemetry prior to and during treatment with inhibitors of the autonomic nervous system, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), or endothelin-1 A receptor (ET(A)). Also, indices of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activation were measured. ahr(+/-) and ahr(-/-) mice were normotensive and hypotensive, respectively, compared to wild-type (ahr(+/+)) littermates. Responses of all genotypes to autonomic nervous system inhibition were normal. ahr(+/-) mice responded normally to NOS inhibition, while the responses of ahr(-/-) mice were significantly blunted. In contrast, ahr(+/-) mice were significantly more responsive to inhibition of ACE, an ET(A) antagonist, or both, while ahr(-/-) mice were significantly less responsive to ACE inhibition and more responsive to an ET(A) antagonist. ahr(+/-) mice also exhibited significant increases in plasma renin and ACE activity, plasma sodium, and urine osmolality, indicative of RAS activation. Thus, normotension in ahr(+/-) mice appears to be maintained by increased RAS and ET-1 signaling, while hypotension in ahr(-/-) mice may result from decreased RAS signaling. In conclusion, despite the lack of overt fetal vascular abnormalities in ahr(+/-) mice, the loss of a single ahr allele has a significant effect on blood pressure regulation.",

    "946": "Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is stimulated by diverse stimuli and is likely to be regulated by many signaling pathways. cAMP is known to act as a second messenger for various extracellular stimuli and to be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Here, we investigated the effect of cAMP on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced MMP-1 expression and the molecular events involved in the processes in human skin fibroblasts. We showed that cAMP suppresses TNF-alpha-induced MMP-1 expression via protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. cAMP inhibited TNF-alpha-stimulated ERK and JNK activation, which was shown to have an important role in MMP-1 expression. However, MMP-1 expression could also be inhibited by cAMP even when ERK and JNK activities were unaffected, indicating that there might be other target(s) that mediate cAMP-mediated suppression of MMP-1 expression. Further studies revealed that glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta can be inactivated by cAMP/PKA pathway and has important roles in MMP-1 expression, and showed that inactivation of GSK-3beta is critical for suppression of MMP-1 expression by cAMP elevation after TNF-alpha treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that cAMP/PKA pathway can suppress MMP-1 expression through inhibition of multiple signaling pathways, including MAPK and GSK-3beta.", 
    "947": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed at high levels in the kidney and converts angiotensin II (ANG II) to ANG-(1-7). We studied the effects of ACE2 inhibition and ANG-(1-7) in the (5/6) nephrectomy ((5/6) Nx) mouse model of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Male FVB mice underwent sham surgery (Sham) or (5/6) Nx and were administered either vehicle, the ACE2 inhibitor MLN-4760 (MLN), the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan, MLN plus losartan, or ANG-(1-7) for 4 wk. In (5/6) Nx mice with or without MLN, kidney cortical ACE2 protein expression was significantly decreased at 4 wk, compared with Sham. Inhibition of ACE2 caused a decrease in renal cortical ACE2 activity. Kidney cortical ACE expression and activity did not differ between groups of mice. In (5/6) Nx mice treated with MLN, kidney levels of ANG II were significantly increased, compared with Sham. (5/6) Nx induced a mild but insignificant increase in blood pressure (BP), a 50% reduction in FITC-inulin clearance, and a significant increase in urinary albumin excretion. ACE2 inhibition in (5/6) Nx mice did not affect BP or FITC-inulin clearance but significantly increased albuminuria compared with (5/6) Nx alone, an effect reversed by losartan. Treatment of (5/6) Nx mice with ANG-(1-7) increased kidney and plasma levels of ANG-(1-7) but did not alter BP, FITC-inulin clearance, or urinary albumin excretion, and it increased relative mesangial area. These data indicate that kidney ACE2 is downregulated in the early period after (5/6) Nx. Inhibition of ACE2 in (5/6) Nx mice increases albuminuria via an AT(1) receptor-dependent mechanism, independent of BP. In contrast, ANG-(1-7) does not affect albuminuria after (5/6) Nx. We propose that endogenous ACE2 is renoprotective in CKD.",

Elevated Ang II levels and enhanced TGF-beta1/Smad signaling activation were also observed in smoke-exposed lungs. Chymase inhibition with chymostatin reduced the cigarette smoke-induced increase in chymase activity and Ang II concentration in the lung, and attenuated the RVSP elevation and the remodeling of pulmonary arterioles. Chymostatin did not affect angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in hamster lungs.",

The capability of activated chymase to induce Ang II formation and TGF-beta1 signaling may be part of the mechanism for smoking-induced pulmonary vascular remodeling.

Treatment regimens for asymptomatic antibody-positive patients and those with refractory or recurrent disease remain controversial. There is scant literature on the epidemiology and therapy of neurological APS manifestations in pediatric patients. Assessments of modifiable cardiovascular and inherited thrombophilia risk factors are essential in patients with APS.
