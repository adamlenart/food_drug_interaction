In particular new onset diabetes is significantly increased in association with the use of thiazides or beta-blockers, respectively, compared to placebo, whereas treatment with angiotensin-conversion-enzyme-inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor-blockers is associated with a lower than expected frequency, as also assessed in several meta-analyses. In line with these notions, the NAVIGATOR Trial was the first to report a significant preventive effect of an angiotensin-receptor-blocker on new onset diabetes evaluated as a primary outcome in a prospective randomized study. Hence, and in view of the fact that comparable blood pressure lowering with any of the five major classes of antihypertensive drugs, including calcium-channel-blockers, give comparable benefits in reducing cardiovascular complications, unless there are specific indications or contraindications for an individual drug, caution should be exercised, therefore, to use beta-blockers or thiazides as first-line drugs for blood pressure lowering indications in subjects at high risk to develop diabetes, especially in patients with so called metabolic syndrome. The potential of glycemic worsening in overt diabetic patients with thiazides or beta-blockers has less well been studied systematically, yet paradigmatically in UKPDS evaluating a randomized comparison of a beta-blocker with an angiotensin-conversion-enzyme(ACE)-inhibitor. Not only was there HbA1c worsening with beta-blocker use which required additional blood glucose lowering therapy, but also significantly more weight gain which still was detectable at the 20\u2003year follow-up. On the other hand, the overall cardiovascular outcomes were comparable in the two treatment groups irrespective whether therapy was based on the beta blocker atenolol or the ACE-inhibitor captopril. Awareness of these facts and highly individualized therapy seem to be the way forward.",

ACE-inhibitory genes and their pro-active precursors were designed, synthesized by PCR, and cloned in Escherichia coli; after which, they were cloned into the pAM1 E.\u00a0coli-bifidobacteria shuttle vector. After E.\u00a0coli transformation, constructs carrying the six recombinant clones were electrotransferred into the Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum M115 probiotic strain.

In the PBMCs isolated from patients with acute congestive heart failure (ACHF) and impaired renal function, higher SDMA and ADMA levels were more evident after therapy, as were reduced expression and activity of eNOS. Increased O2- produced after treatment may be involved in impaired recovery of cardiac function associated with higher plasma levels of SDMA.",

Hypertensive disorders are strongly linked with an overactive RAAS, and RAAS inhibitors, like angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are routinely used to treat high blood pressure (BP). BP reduction is one of the main goals of current European hypertension guidelines. Oral ACE inhibitors, the oldest category of RAAS inhibitor, were commercially released over 30 years ago in the early 1980s, over a decade before the first ARBs became available. The introduction of ACE inhibitors heralded major changes in the way hypertension and cardiovascular disease were treated. Although the decision of the medical community to replace older ACE inhibitors with more modern ARBs in the 1990s was debatable, it did nevertheless allow scientists to learn more about the angiotensin receptors involved in RAAS stimulation. This and much else of value have been discovered since RAAS inhibitors first became available, but some surprising gaps in our knowledge exist. Until recently, the effect of RAAS inhibition on mortality in hypertension was unknown. This question was recently addressed by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in populations who received contemporary antihypertensive medication. The results of this meta-analysis have helped elucidate the long-term consequences of treatment with RAAS inhibitors on mortality in hypertension. This article will consider the differences between RAAS inhibitors in terms of pharmacological and clinical effects and analyze the impact of the main types of RAAS inhibitor, ACE inhibitors and ARBs, on mortality reduction in hypertensive patients with reference to this latest meta-analysis.", 
    "59": "to elucidate the prognostic role of angiotensin receptor (ATR1) gene polymorphism relative to progression of the disease and effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "60": "We included in this study 132 consecutive patients (48 women [36.4%, mean age 51.6 years] and 84 men [63.6%, mean age 49.4 years) with diagnosis of arterial hypertension (AH), who underwent echocardiography not less than 10 months from the date of entry into the study. Mean duration of follow-up was about 5 years. In all patients we determined belonging to one of variants of polymorphic A1166C gene: AA, AC, or CC. This allowed us to divide them into 2 groups: carriers of allele A (group A) and allele C (group C). In both groups we observed significant regression of left ventricular myocardial mass (LVMM) in those patients who achieved target BP. No significant changes of LVMM were noted in patients with partially effective or ineffective antihypertensive treatment (AHT). Regression of LVMM was observed more frequently among patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) compared with those who used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI).", 
    "61": "Thus it was established that irrespective of the structure of polymorphic ATR1 gene there existed a parallelism of antihypertensive and antiremodelling efficacy of treatment of AH. Besides that, the ATR1 gene polymorphism can be considered as an additional factor determining efficacy of AHT. In particular, carriers of C allele respond better to therapy with ARBs, and carriers of A allele--with ACEI. In this case, the carriers of allele C can be expected to decrease their LVMM more expressive than carriers of the allele A.", 
    "62": "According to results of large clinical studies angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) and aliskiren do not lower risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality in wide spectrum of clinical conditions and are able to worsen renal outcomes. It is expedient to prefer inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme in particular perindopril over ARB in the treatment of patients with arterial hypertension taking into consideration differences in effect on mortality. Fixed perindopril/indapamide combination provides achievement of target arterial pressure in many patients with uncontrolled hypertension, has good tolerability, is metabolically neutral, and possesses high organoprotective properties.", 
    "63": "This review article presents approaches to the selection of strategy of antihypertensive therapy in hypertensive patients according to the degree of elevation of blood pressure (BP), the level of risk for cardiovascular complications, the doses of drugs used in accordance with current guidelines. A comparative analysis of different strategic approaches is given. The importance of combined antihypertensive therapy, including fixed combinations, not only in terms of reducing BP, improving patient adherence to treatment, but also in terms of a favorable effect on the prognosis is shown. Rational combinations of antihypertensive drugs depending on the specific clinical situation are marked. Attention is paid to the new fixed combinations, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists.", 
    "64": "To evaluate the impact of combination antihypertensive therapy with ekvator on heart rate variability (HRV) parameters and target organ status in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).", 
    "65": "The investigation enrolled 30 patients aged 40-65 years with Stages II--III AH concurrent with T2DM. All the patients received combination antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine + lisinopril for 12 weeks. HRV parameters, baseline autonomic tone, and autonomic responsiveness were studied, by analyzing ECG reading of their hearts in the 5-minute segments. Echocardiography was performed and arterial elastic properties and renal functional were examined.", 
    "66": "12-week ekvator therapy showed a high (93.3%) rate of achieved goal blood pressure (BP) levels. There was a statistically significant reduction in resting tension index by 66% and during an active orthostatic test by 43.5% during combination antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine and lisinopril. Twelve weeks after treatment, the normal type of autonomic responsiveness was prevalent (53.4%) in patients with AH and T2DM, with a significant decline in the number of persons with asympaticotonic autonomic responsiveness. There was a significant decrease in left ventricular mass index by 10.7% and microalbuminuria by 27.7% and a 30% decline in the number of patients with a higher pulse wave velocity along the elastic arteries. There were close highly significant correlations between the parameters of HRV and the status of target organs (heart, kidney, and vessels).", 
    "67": "12-week ekvator treatment not only normalizes effectively BP and has a favorable impact on target organs, but also improves HRV parameters in the patients with AH and T2DM, in this connection, HRV may be, in our opinion, regarded as another combination antihypertensive therapy target.",

Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important physiological role in regulation of blood pressure via conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibition of ACE may have an antihypertensive effect as a consequence of a decrease in blood pressure. A number of terrestrial-derived peptides have been reviewed about their in vitro and in vivo ACE-inhibitory activities. Marine organisms are potentially an untapped source of drugs and value-added food production. The aim of this review is to discuss the marine-derived ACE-inhibitory peptides from sources, production, structure aspects, and their future prospects as functional food or novel therapeutic drug candidates.", 
    "73": "The action of taxifolin on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in the aorta of aging rats and rats treated with nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N \u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)) or dexamethasone have been studied. The ACE activity in aorta sections was determined by measuring the hydrolysis of hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine, and the ROS/RNS production was measured by oxidation of dichlorodihydrofluorescein. It was shown that taxifolin at a dose of 30-100 \u03bcg/kg/day decreases the ACE activity in the aorta of aging rats and of rats treated with L-NAME or dexamethasone to the level of the ACE activity in young control rats. Taxifolin (100 \u03bcg/kg/day) was found to also reduce the amount of ROS/RNS in the aorta that increased as a result of L-NAME intake. L-NAME treatment increases the contribution of 5-lipoxygenase and NADPH oxidase to ROS/RNS production in the aorta, while taxifolin (100 \u03bcg/kg/day) decreases the contribution of these enzymes to the normal level.", 
    "74": "Opioid mechanisms are involved in the control of water and NaCl intake and opioid receptors (ORs) are present in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a site of important facilitatory mechanisms related to the control of sodium appetite. Therefore, in the present study we investigated the effects of the activation of \u03bc-ORs in the CeA on 0.3 M NaCl and water intake in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally in the CeA were used. In rats submitted to water deprivation-partial rehydration, bilateral injections of the selective \u03bc-OR agonist [D-Ala\u00b2, N-Me-Phe\u2074, Gly\u2075-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) in the doses of 1, 2, and 4 nmol into the CeA induced a dose-related increase of 0.3M NaCl intake and water intake, and bilateral injections of the selective \u03bc-OR antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH\u2082 (CTAP) in the doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 nmol into the CeA produced a dose-related decrease of 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO 2 nmol into the same site. In rats treated with the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg b.w.) combined with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg b.w.) injected subcutaneously, bilateral injections of DAMGO 2 nmol into the CeA increased 0.3 M NaCl intake and water intake and the blockade of \u03bc-ORs with CTAP 1 nmol injected into the CeA reduced the increase in 0.3 M NaCl intake and water intake induced by DAMGO 2 nmol into the same site. Bilateral injections of DAMGO into the CeA did not change urinary volume, sodium urinary excretion and mean arterial pressure, but increased activity. Thus stimulating \u03bc-ORs in the CeA increases hypertonic sodium intake, whereas antagonizing these sites inhibits hypertonic sodium intake. Together, our results implicate \u03bc-ORs in the CeA in a positive regulation of sodium intake.", 
    "75": "The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) is recognized as the main biological system involved in cardiovascular and hydroelectrolyte homeostasis. It is well established in literature that RAS blockers retard the progression of renal failure in type 1 [angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors] and in type 2 [angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists] diabetes mellitus and in non-diabetic chronic kidney diseases. More recently, it was shown that newer therapeutic agents, the renin inhibitors, also exert renoprotective actions. Obesity is recognized as a proinflammatory state often associated with kidney diseases. Recent publications have associated the RAS axis imbalance leading to a predominance of Angiotensin II effects with changes in adipokine levels and actions. In this context, the aim of the current review is to present current evidence on the potential role of RAS blockers in modulating the interaction between adipokines and obesity-related renal disorders.", 
    "76": "The addition of spironolactone to the combination of an ACE inhibitor, and ARB, and a direct renin inhibitor brought about dramatic and sustained reversal of 4-plus proteinuria in a patient with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Spironolactone may be a valuable addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for such patients, with the caveat that the spironolactone dose should be increased gradually and with frequent monitoring of the serum potassium level.",

    "78": "Sixty-three patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction were treated with perindopril for 12 months at the doses of 4 mg (group N) and 8 mg (group H). Doppler imaging was used to measure the structural and systolic functional parameters before and after the treatment, and the circumferential end-systolic wall stress (cESS) and myocardial energy expenditure (MEE) were calculated. The biochemical indicators including serum creatinine and plasma NT-proBNP were detected before and after the treatment.", 
    "79": "The two groups had similar measurements before treatment. After 12 months of perindopril treatment, the patients in group N showed higher LA, LV, RA, RV, LVIDs, AD, cESS, lgNT-proBNP, and MEE with lower LVFS and LVEF than those in group H. Compared to those before treatment, LVFS and LVEF were increased and LA, LV, RA, RV, AD, LVIDs, LVMI, lgNT-proBNP and MEEm lowered after the 12-month treatment in group H. Significant changes were also found in the measured parameters except for PWTs, LVET, LVSV and LVFS in group N after the treatment. Bivariate analysis showed a significant positive correlation between MEE and lgNT-proBNP (r=0.513, P<0.01).",

    "81": "While it is now well established that the independent brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has some important central functions besides the vascular ones, the relevance of its main bioactive peptide angiotensin II (Ang II) on the memory processes, as well as on oxidative stress status is not completely understood. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the effects of central Ang II administration, as well as the effects of Ang II inhibition with either AT1 and AT 2 receptor specific blockers (losartan and PD-123177, respectively) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (captopril). These effects were studied on the short-term memory (assessed through Y-maze) or long-term memory (as determined in passive avoidance) and on the oxidative stress status of the hippocampus. Our results demonstrate memory deficits induced by the administration of Ang II, as showed by the significant decrease of the spontaneous alternation in Y-maze (p=0.015) and latency-time in passive avoidance task (p=0.001) when compared to saline. On the other side, the administration of all the aforementioned Ang II blockers significantly improved the spontaneous alternation in Y-maze task, while losartan also increased the latency time as compared to saline in step-through passive avoidance (p=0.042). Also, increased oxidative stress status was induced in the hippocampus by the administration of Ang II, as demonstrated by increased levels of lipid peroxidation markers (malondialdehyde-MDA concentration) (p<0.0001) and a decrease in both antioxidant enzymes determined: superoxide dismutase-SOD (p<0.0001) and glutathione peroxidase-GPX (p=0.01), as compared to saline. Additionally, the administration of captopril resulted in an increase of both antioxidant enzymes and decreased levels of lipid peroxidation (p=0.001), while PD-123177 significantly decreased MDA concentration (p>0.0001) vs. saline. Moreover, significant correlations were found between all of the memory related behavioral parameters and the main oxidative stress markers from the hippocampus, which is known for its implication in the processes of memory and also where RAS components are well expressed. This could be relevant for the complex interactions between Ang II, behavioral processes and neuronal oxidative stress, and could generate important therapeutic approaches.", 
    "82": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a lately discovered enzyme catalyzing Angiotensin II into Angiotensin 1-7. Angiotensin II has been reported to impair endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function and is detrimental to stroke. Here, we studied the role of ACE2 in regulating EPC function in vitro and in vivo. EPCs were cultured from human renin and angiotensinogen transgenic (R+A+) mice and their controls (R-A-). In in vitro experiments, EPCs were transduced with lentivirus-ACE2 or lentivirus-green fluorescence protein. The effects of ACE2 overexpression on EPC function and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)/nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (Nox) expression were determined. ACE2, eNOS, and Nox inhibitors were used for pathway validation. In in vivo studies, the therapeutic efficacy of EPCs overexpressing ACE2 was determined at day 7 after ischemic stroke induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found that (1) lentivirus-ACE2 transduction resulted in a 4-fold increase of ACE2 expression in EPCs. This was accompanied with an increase in eNOS expression and NO production, and a decrease in Nox2 and -4 expression and reactive oxygen species production. (2) ACE2 overexpression improved the abilities of EPC migration and tube formation, which were impaired in R+A+ mice. These effects were inhibited by ACE2 or eNOS inhibitor and further enhanced by Nox inhibitor. (3) Transfusion of lentivirus-ACE2-primed EPCs reduced cerebral infarct volume and neurological deficits, and increased cerebral microvascular density and angiogenesis. Our data demonstrate that ACE2 improves EPC function, via regulating eNOS and Nox pathways, and enhances the efficacy of EPC-based therapy for ischemic stroke.", 
    "83": "At least half of primary autonomic failure patients exhibit supine hypertension, despite profound impairments in sympathetic activity. Although the mechanisms underlying this hypertension are unknown, plasma renin activity is often undetectable, suggesting renin-angiotensin (Ang) pathways are not involved. However, because aldosterone levels are preserved, we tested the hypothesis that Ang II is intact and contributes to the hypertension of autonomic failure. Indeed, circulating Ang II was paradoxically increased in hypertensive autonomic failure patients (52\u00b15 pg/mL, n=11) compared with matched healthy controls (27\u00b14 pg/mL, n=10; P=0.002), despite similarly low renin activity (0.19\u00b10.06 versus 0.34\u00b10.13 ng/mL per hour, respectively; P=0.449). To determine the contribution of Ang II to supine hypertension in these patients, we administered the AT(1) receptor blocker losartan (50 mg) at bedtime in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=11). Losartan maximally reduced systolic blood pressure by 32\u00b111 mm Hg at 6 hours after administration (P<0.05), decreased nocturnal urinary sodium excretion (P=0.0461), and did not worsen morning orthostatic tolerance. In contrast, there was no effect of captopril on supine blood pressure in a subset of these patients. These findings suggest that Ang II formation in autonomic failure is independent of plasma renin activity, and perhaps Ang-converting enzyme. Furthermore, these studies suggest that elevations in Ang II contribute to the hypertension of autonomic failure, and provide rationale for the use of AT(1) receptor blockers for treatment of these patients.", 
    "84": "Green bioanalytical approaches are oriented toward minimization or elimination of hazardous chemicals associated to bioanalytical applications. LC/MS-MS assay of enalapril and enalaprilat in human plasma was achieved by elimination of acetonitrile from both sample preparation and chromatographic separation stages. Protein precipitation (PP) by acetonitrile addition was replaced by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in 1-octanol followed by direct large volume injection of the organic layer in the chromatographic column operated under reversed phase (RP) separation mechanism. At the mean time, acetonitrile used as organic modifier in the mobile phase was successfully replaced by a mixture of propylene carbonate/ethanol (7/3, v/v). Three analytical alternatives ((I) acetonitrile PP+acetonitrile based chromatographic elution; (II) 1-octanol LLE+acetonitrile based chromatographic elution; (III) 1-octanol LLE+propylene carbonate/ethanol based chromatographic elution) were validated and the quality characteristics were compared.

The J. curcas protein hydrolysate produced with the pepsin-pancreatin system from protein isolate had the highest TEAC value and was shown to undergo single-electron transfer reactions in the ABTS(+) reduction assay, demonstrating its antioxidant capacity. Testing of antimicrobial activity in the J. curcas protein hydrolysates against seven bacterial pathogens showed no growth inhibitory effect in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. More ACE-I inhibitory active peptides were produced in the Alcalase hydrolysates obtained from J. curcas protein isolate. The protein hydrolysate obtained with Alcalase from defatted J. curcas flour as well as from the protein isolate showed the highest inhibitory effect of ADP-induced aggregation of human platelets in platelet-rich plasma. It is expected that the information collated will facilitate new applications of proteins present in Jatropha plant.",

Of these, 275 patients underwent ICD implantation for primary prevention of SCD and 101 for secondary prevention. Operative protocols and in-hospital and outpatient records were analysed retrospectively. Mean QRS width and heart rate (HR) were calculated in resting surface electrocardiograms (25 mm/s, 10 mm/1 mV). Intracardiac electrograms stored in ICD memory were used to evaluate appropriateness of anti-arrhythmic interventions and analyse the number of ventricular tachyarrhythmia events, ICD interventions and their type. We analysed the following clinical and procedural variables: age, gender, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), type of SCD prevention (primary or secondary), ICD type (single chamber--VR, dual chamber--DR), performing defibrillation threshold testing to establish defibrillation safety margin at ICD implantation, ventricular lead location (right ventricular outflow tract region, right ventricular apex), mean HR, QRS width, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, occurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention after implantation, ICD interventions, history of cardiovascular disease and arrhythmia (myocardial infarction, ischaemic and non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy, arterial hypertension, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, permanent atrial fibrillation, percutaneous coronary intervention, and/or coronary artery bypass grafting), and medications (amiodarone, sotalol, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEI]/angiotensin receptor blockers [ARB], statins, loop diuretics, aldosterone antagonists).",

Mean time interval from ICD implantation to the occurrence of arrhythmia was 281 \u00b1 229 (range 5-972) days (p \u3008 0.001). To optimize sensitivity and specificity when analysing ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention vs. no ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention, cutoff values were established using ROC curves (cutoff for LVEF = 31%, HR = 79 bpm). Using these cutoff values, patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention were compared to those without ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention. Significant differences were observed in LVEF (p< 0.001), HR (p< 0.022), ACEI/ARB use (p< 0.034), and NYHA class (p< 0.001). By Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis, patients with LVEF> 31% (log-rank test p< 0.001), HR \u2264 79 bpm (log-rank test p< 0.022), QRS width \u2264 114 ms (log-rank test p < 0.045), and NYHA class II (log-rank test p< 0.001) were more likely to be free from ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention. Cox multivariate analysis showed that reduced LVEF (\u2264 31%) was the only independent predictor of arrhythmia/intervention. LVEF values below 31% are associated with a significant 20-fold increase (p< 0.02) in the risk of arrhythmia during the first 3 years after ICD implantation. Among 68 patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention, mean 4.1 interventions per person occurred during the follow-up period. In the overall study population, the number of interventions was 0.28 per person per year. Overall, 92 inappropriate ICD interventions were observed, all resulting from atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate. Interventions had no effect on total mortality. Higher numbers of appropriate interventions were observed in patients who died due to heart failure.", 
    "90": "Factors associated with a significantly increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia/appropriate ICD intervention included reduced LVEF, increased resting HR, NYHA class II or higher heart failure, and wide QRS. Patients with low LVEF (< 31%) are at particular risk of SCD due to ventricular arrhythmia and this parameter alone can influence the decision regarding ICD implantation. No effect of ICD interventions on total mortality was observed, although more ICD interventions were observed in patients who died due to heart failure.",

The current standard for cardiac monitoring during cancer therapy, mainly based on left ventricular ejection fraction assessment, detects myocardial damage only when a functional impairment has already occurred, not allowing for early preventive strategies. Measurement of cardiospecific biomarkers has proven to have higher prognostic value than imaging modalities. In particular, cardiac troponin elevation during chemotherapy allows the identification of patients who are more prone to develop myocardial dysfunction and cardiac events during follow-up. In these patients, the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor such as enalapril has shown to be effective in improving clinical outcome, giving the chance for a cardioprotective strategy in a selected population. Once left ventricular dysfunction occurs, heart failure therapies currently used for other forms of left ventricular dysfunction, particularly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers, seem to be effective.

The only proven therapy for severe AVD is open aortic valve replacement, with trans-catheter aortic valve implantation emerging as a promising modality to treat severe aortic stenosis in a selected group of patients. AVD has a long asymptomatic phase with symptoms occurring late in the disease and once symptoms develop, prognosis is poor. There is a growing appreciation that aortic valvular heart disease incorporates a disease process that extends beyond the valve itself leading to an aortic valvular 'heart' disease. The renin-angiotensin system is known to modulate adverse left ventricular remodeling and myocardial fibrosis, which could be caused by increased load caused by the AVD. In this review, the authors explore evidence that suggest that drugs that target the renin-angiotensin system may have a potential therapeutic role in AVD.", 
    "110": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc-dependent peptidase responsible for converting angiotensin I into the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. However, ACE is a relatively nonspecific peptidase that is capable of cleaving a wide range of substrates. Because of this, ACE and its peptide substrates and products affect many physiologic processes, including blood pressure control, hematopoiesis, reproduction, renal development, renal function, and the immune response. The defining feature of ACE is that it is composed of two homologous and independently catalytic domains, the result of an ancient gene duplication, and ACE-like genes are widely distributed in nature. The two ACE catalytic domains contribute to the wide substrate diversity of ACE and, by extension, the physiologic impact of the enzyme. Several studies suggest that the two catalytic domains have different biologic functions. Recently, the X-ray crystal structure of ACE has elucidated some of the structural differences between the two ACE domains. This is important now that ACE domain-specific inhibitors have been synthesized and characterized. Once widely available, these reagents will undoubtedly be powerful tools for probing the physiologic actions of each ACE domain. In turn, this knowledge should allow clinicians to envision new therapies for diseases not currently treated with ACE inhibitors.",

Incremental doses of SPS monotherapy yielded potassium reductions between 0.7 and 1.1 mEq/L, and inadequate responses (K <0.5 mEq/L) were less frequent with higher doses. There were no differences in the effectiveness of SPS among dialysis-dependent, chronic kidney disease, or nonchronic kidney disease patients. Greater reductions in potassium were observed using a combination of treatments. ECGs were performed in 44% of patients, and 50% showed no ECG changes despite K being \u22656.5 mEq/L.

Thus, the objective of this study was to determine whether ARBs are associated with an overall increased risk of the four most common cancers, namely, lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers, and to explore these effects separately for each cancer type. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nested case-control analysis within the United Kingdom (UK) General Practice Research Database. We assembled a cohort of patients prescribed antihypertensive agents between 1995, the year the first ARB (losartan) entered the UK market, and 2008, with follow-up until December 31, 2010. Cases were patients newly-diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer during follow-up. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of cancer incidence, comparing ever use of ARBs with ever use of diuretics and/or beta-blockers. The cohort included 1,165,781 patients, during which 41,059 patients were diagnosed with one of the cancers under study (rate 554/100,000 person-years). When compared to diuretics and/or beta-blockers, ever use of ARBs was not associated with an increased rate of cancer overall (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96-1.03) or with each cancer site separately. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers was associated with an increased rate of lung cancer (RR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.06-1.20 and RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12-1.27, respectively). This study provides additional evidence that the use of ARBs does not increase the risk of cancer overall or any of the four major cancer sites.

    "138": "It is well known that the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) plays a key role in the modulation of many functions in the body. AngII (angiotensin II) acting on AT1R (type 1 AngII receptor) has a central role in mediating most of the actions of the RAS. However, over the past 10\u00a0years, several studies have presented evidence for the existence of a new arm of the RAS, namely the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2/Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)]/Mas axis. Ang-(1-7) can be produced from AngI or AngII via endo- or carboxy-peptidases respectively. ACE2 appears to play a central role in Ang-(1-7) formation. As described for AngII, Ang-(1-7) also has a broad range of effects in different organs and tissues which goes beyond its initially described cardiovascular and renal actions. Those effects are mediated by Mas and can counter-regulate most of the deleterious effects of AngII. The interaction Ang-(1-7)/Mas regulates different signalling pathways, such as PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/AKT and ERK (extracellularsignal-regulated kinase) pathways and involves downstream effectors such as NO, FOXO1 (forkhead box O1) and COX-2 (cyclo-oxygenase-2). Through these mechanisms, Ang-(1-7) is able to improve pathological conditions including fibrosis and inflammation in organs such as lungs, liver and kidney. In addition, this heptapeptide has positive effects on metabolism, increasing the glucose uptake and lipolysis while decreasing insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia. Ang-(1-7) is also able to improve cerebroprotection against ischaemic stroke, besides its effects on learning and memory. The reproductive system can also be affected by Ang-(1-7) treatment, with enhanced ovulation, spermatogenesis and sexual steroids synthesis. Finally, Ang-(1-7) is considered a potential anti-cancer treatment since it is able to inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Thus the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas pathway seems to be involved in many physiological and pathophysiological processes in several systems and organs especially by opposing the detrimental effects of inappropriate overactivation of the ACE/AngII/AT1R axis.", 
    "139": "Diastolic heart failure, which is also called as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, is a clinical syndrome in which patients have signs and symptoms of heart failure, normal or near normal left ventricular ejection fraction (\u2265 50%) and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. Recent epidemiological studies have demonstrated that more than half of all heart failure patients have diastolic heart failure. The syndrome is more common in women than in men and the prevalence increases with age. Patients with diastolic heart failure form a fairly heterogeneous group with complex pathophysiologic mechanisms. The disease is often in association with other comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus or obesity. The diagnosis of diastolic heart failure is best achieved by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography, which can detect abnormal myocardial relaxation, decreased compliance and increased filling pressure in the setting of normal left ventricular dimensions and preserved ejection fraction. Unlike heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, there is no such an evidence-based treatment for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which would improve clinical outcomes. Thus, pharmacological therapy of diastolic heart failure is based mainly on empiric data, and aims to the normalization of blood pressure, reduction of left ventricular dimensions and increased heart rate, maintenance of normal atrial contraction and treatment of symptoms caused by congestion. Beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers may be utilized in patients with diastolic dysfunction, especially in those with hypertension. Beta-blockers appear to be useful in lowering heart rate and thereby prolonging left ventricular diastolic filling time, while diuretic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for preventing pulmonary congestion. Nonetheless, treatment of the underlying disease is also an important therapeutic approach. This review summarizes the state of current knowledge with regard to diastolic heart failure.",

In case of severe systolic dysfunction, hospitalization and mortality can be reduced using angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocking drugs, beta-receptor blocking agents and aldosterone antagonists, as evidenced in multicentric studies. In selected cases different cardiac interventions, such as intracardial defibrillator and/or cardiac desynchronization device implantation can be used for supporting the failing left ventricle. In terminal stage, special devices (ventricular assist device, intra-aortic balloon pump, arteficial heart) and, finally, heart transplantation can be applied. In this paper, the authors highlight therapeutic options of chronic systolic heart failure referring to recommendations of the latest, 2012 guideline from the European Society of Cardiology.",

Despite the proven efficacy of RAAS blockade, however, the reduction in proteinuria is insufficient in many patients, and does not prevent further deterioration of renal function. Short-term studies have shown that a variety of treatment intensification strategies have a beneficial effect on blood pressure and proteinuria, including RAAS blockade using either dose escalation or multiple drugs, and restriction of dietary sodium. Large clinical trials have shown that RAAS blockade with multiple drugs does not improve patients' long-term renal or cardiovascular outcome. By contrast, two post-hoc analyses of landmark trials in nephrology show beneficial renal and cardiovascular effects from avoiding excessive dietary sodium intake during single-agent RAAS blockade therapy. The effects of dietary sodium restriction on renal or cardiovascular outcome still require prospective confirmation. However, current data support the implementation of lifestyle changes to reduce dietary sodium intake in combination with single-agent RAAS blockade, rather than dual-agent RAAS blockade, as a potent and feasible strategy to mitigate the burden of renal and cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD.",

Increased arterial stiffness is the vascular phenotype of systolic hypertension, especially of the large arteries. Elevated systolic blood pressure is even more associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality than diastolic blood pressure. Treatment of systolic hypertension in the elderly should be based on nonpharmacological measures and medical therapy if the systolic hypertension cannot be controlled by conservative therapy alone. The HYVET study provided evidence-based medicine data showing that, in the very elderly, lowering blood pressure to a level of 150/80 mmHg is still very beneficial. Antihypertensive therapy needs to be tailored in the elderly because of comorbid conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, renal insufficiency and diabetes. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor blockers should be considered in combination with diuretics or with a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist. \u03b2-blockers seem to be less effective for cardiovascular disease protection in comparison with other antihypertensive drug classes, such as diuretics, dihydropyridines, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor blockers.

However, whether one is preferable over the other is not known. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for randomized clinical trials (RCTs), until March 2011, of trials testing either an ARB, DRI, or an aldosterone antagonist in patients with heart failure who were on conventional heart failure therapy with follow-up of at least 3 months. Efficacy (death, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization and composite of cardiovascular death or heart failure hospitalization) and safety (hyperkalemia, hypotension, renal failure) outcomes were compared. The authors identified 16 RCTs involving 31,429 participants that satisfied the inclusion criteria.

However, ARBs and DRIs did not result in any significant reduction in the rate of any of the efficacy outcomes when compared with placebo. When compared with placebo (RR=1), ARBs increased the rate of hyperkalemia (138% increase), renal failure (126% increase), and hypotension (63% increase). Similarly, aldosterone antagonists resulted in a 110% increase in hyperkalemia and DRIs with a 98% increase in hypotension.

Telmisartan increased PPAR\u03b4 expression and activated PPAR\u03b4 transcriptional activity in cultured C2C12 myotubes. In palmitate-induced insulin-resistant C2C12 myotubes, telmisartan enhanced insulin-stimulated Akt and Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) phosphorylation as well as Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane. These effects were inhibited by antagonizing PPAR\u03b4 or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, but not by PPAR\u03b3 and PPAR\u03b1 inhibition. Palmitate reducing the insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in C2C12 myotubes could be restored by telmisartan.

The differential expression of messenger RNA by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and protein by Western blot analysis was assessed for the markers nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase, p22phox, endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, and AT1 receptor. Furthermore, TOP-induced vascular relaxation was also investigated using rat aortic rings in an organ bath. TOP significantly downregulated both messenger RNA and protein expressions of p22phox and AT1 receptor; the latter facilitates vasoconstriction through angiotensin II. In addition, TOP upregulated endothelial NO synthase, thus enhancing the production of NO. Vascular studies revealed that TOP caused endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. In conclusion, unlike the free sulfur in captopril, the thiophene ring in TOP may act as a better scavenger of free radicals. Therefore, TOP exerted more significant antihypertensive effects than captopril, not only through angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition but also through more effective antioxidation, because the inherent thiophene moiety resulted in the enhanced production of NO.",

Stimulation of the renin system (ACE inhibitor, renal hypoperfusion) resulted in the recruitment of renin-producing cells in the afferent arterioles and parallel upregulation of LIMP-2, but not LAMP-1 or LAMP-2. Despite the coregulation of renin and LIMP-2, LIMP-2-deficient mice had normal renal renin mRNA levels, renal renin and prorenin contents, and plasma renin and prorenin concentrations under control conditions and in response to stimulation with a low salt diet (with or without angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition). No differences in the size or number of renin vesicles were detected using electron microscopy. Acute stimulation of renin release by isoproterenol exerted similar responses in both genotypes in vivo and in isolated perfused kidneys. Renin and the major lysosomal protein LIMP-2 are colocalized and coregulated in renal JG cells, further corroborating the lysosomal nature of renin storage vesicles. LIMP-2 does not appear to play an obvious role in the regulation of renin synthesis or release.", 
    "197": "Many medications have been developed for one purpose but then are found to have other clinical activities. There is tremendous interest in whether non-cancer medications may potentially have effects on breast cancer survival. In this review article, we have presented and evaluated the evidence for several commonly used over-the-counter and prescription medications - including aspirin (and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, digoxin, and metformin - that have been evaluated among breast cancer survivors in prospective studies. Substantial scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that some of these common and relatively safe drugs may reduce breast cancer mortality among those with the disease by an amount that rivals the mortality reduction gained by currently used therapies. In particular, the evidence is strongest for aspirin (approximately 50% reduction), statins (approximately 25% reduction), and metformin (approximately 50% reduction). As these drugs are generic and inexpensive, there is little incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to fund the randomized trials that would show their effectiveness definitively. We advocate that confirmation of these findings in randomized trials be considered a high research priority, as the potential impact on human lives saved could be immense.",

The renin-angiotensin system has been identified in testis where it may play a role in testicular function and be involved in the detrimental effects of antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, our objective was to compare the influence of captopril and propranolol on plasma testosterone levels and on hydrolyzing angiotensin's enzymes (angiotensinases) in the testis of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and in control animals. Twenty-four adult male SHRs were used in this study; eight were treated with captopril in drinking water, 8 with propranolol, and 8 were controls. At the end of the 4 weeks treatment period, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was recorded, blood samples were collected, and the right testis was dissected after perfusion of the rat with saline. The soluble (Sol) and membrane-bound (MB) fractions were obtained after solubilization and ultracentrifugation. Fluorometric measurement of Sol and MB angiotensinase activities were performed using arylamide derivatives as substrates. Testosterone was measured by enzyme immunoassay. SBP decreased after captopril but did not change with propranolol treatment. Whereas captopril did not affect angiotensinase activities, highly significant reductions in Sol and MB angiotensinase activities, particularly glutamyl- and aspartyl-aminopeptidases, were observed after treatment with propranolol. Plasma testosterone decreased in captopril treated rats but propranolol had a greater effect. The present results support a general functional depression of the RAS cascade in the testis of propranolol-treated SHR, which may influence the sexual function of these animals.",

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the most important system controlling blood pressure (BP), cardiovascular and renal function in man. As our understanding of the crucial role of RAAS in the pathogenesis of most, if not all, CV disease has expanded over the past decades, so has the development of drugs targeting its individual components. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), Ang-II receptor blockers (ARB), and mineralcorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) have been evaluated in large clinical trials for their potential to mediate cardioprotection, singly or in combination. Direct renin inhibitors are currently under scrutiny, as well as novel dual-acting RAAS-blocking agents.

Although Ang (5-8) has generally been considered to be inactive, we show here that Ang (5-8) was the smallest Ang to elicit dose-dependent responses and receptor-mediated antinociception in the rat ventrolateral periaqueductal gray matter (vlPAG). Ang (5-8) antinociception seems to be selective, because it did not alter blood pressure or act on vascular or intestinal smooth muscle cells. The non-selective Ang-receptor (Ang-R) antagonist saralasin blocked Ang (5-8) antinociception, but selective antagonists of Ang-R types I, II, IV, and Mas did not, suggesting that Ang (5-8) may act via an unknown receptor. Endopeptidase EP 24.11 and amastatin-sensitive aminopeptidase from the vlPAG catalyzed the synthesis (from Ang II or Ang III) and inactivation of Ang (5-8), respectively. Selective inhibitors of neuronal-nitric oxide (NO) synthase, soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and a non-selective opioid receptor (opioid-R) inhibitor blocked Ang (5-8)-induced antinociception. In conclusion, Ang (5-8) is a new member of the Ang family that selectively and strongly modulates antinociception via NO-sGC and endogenous opioid in the vlPAG.",

Male Holtzman rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN and unilaterally into the lateral ventricle (LV) were used. Bilateral injections of muscimol (0.5nmol/0.2\u03bcL) into the LPBN induced 0.3M NaCl (32.2\u00b19.9mL/4h, vs. saline: 0.4\u00b10.2mL/4h) and water intake (11.4\u00b14.4mL/4h, vs. saline: 0.8\u00b10.4mL/4h) in fluid-replete rats previously treated with i.c.v. injection of saline.

However, although salt intake is correlated with BP (blood pressure), it also partly determines the activation state of the RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system), a key mediator of diabetes-associated atherosclerosis. apoE KO (apolipoprotein E knockout) mice were allocated for the induction of diabetes with streptozotocin or citrate buffer (controls) and further randomized to isocaloric diets containing 0.05%, 0.3% or 3.1% sodium with or without the ACEi [ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor] perindopril. After 6 weeks of study, plaque accumulation was quantified and markers of atherogenesis were assessed using RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and ELISA. The association of sodium intake and adverse cardiovascular and mortality outcomes were explored in 2648 adults with Type 1 diabetes without prior CVD (cardiovascular disease) from the FinnDiane study. A 0.05% sodium diet was associated with increased plaque accumulation in diabetic apoE KO mice, associated with activation of the RAAS. By contrast, a diet containing 3.1% sodium suppressed atherogenesis associated with suppression of the RAAS, with an efficacy comparable with ACE inhibition. In adults with Type 1 diabetes, low sodium intake was also associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and new-onset cardiovascular events. However, high sodium intake was also associated with adverse outcomes, leading to a J-shaped relationship overall. Although BP lowering is an important goal for the management of diabetes, off-target actions to activate the RAAS may contribute to an observed lack of protection from cardiovascular complications in patients with Type 1 diabetes with low sodium intake.",

The four patients presented here were switched to a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (MRB) that targets aldosterone without any inhibition of angiotensin II, and resulting in significant rebounds back to baseline hemoglobin levels. Furthermore, all patients had optimal blood pressure control and proteinuria reductions. These data support the use of aldosterone blocking agents in kidney disease patients with anemia secondary to ACE-Is or ARB. Presumably, any patient - regardless of kidney status - for whom RAAS blockade is indicated (e.g., diabetic patients or patients with congestive heart failure) should be switched to MRB therapy if significant anemia develops after starting an ACE-Is or ARB.",

This study estimates the rate and factors associated with potential drug-drug interactions in prescriptions from wards of An Iranian General Hospital. Data were retrieved from the pharmacy of a general hospital (200 beds) during one year period 2010. Potential drug-drug interaction were identified using a computerized drug-drug interaction database system (Prescription Analyzer 2000, Sara Rayane Co., Iran). Patients of both genders and 15 years-old or more were included in this study. Prescriptions with two or more drugs prescribed were selected during one year period 2010. Gender number of drugs and therapeutic drug classes on prescriptions were explored as associated factors to drug-drug interaction. The overall prevalence of potential drug-drug interaction was 20.3%. The risks of severe potential drug interactions were relatively high and the rate of potential drug-drug interaction was significantly higher in women (60.6%) and the patients aged over 60 years old (57.1%). The frequency of the potentially severe drug-drug interaction was 10.8% with digoxin-furosemide as the most common interacting pair (5.91%). A positive correlation was found between drug-drug interaction, patient's age, number of drugs and drugs acting on cardiovascular system. So cardiology women inpatients, age more then 60 years old, and patients prescribed digoxin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be closely monitored for adverse outcomes from drug-drug interaction.", 
    "253": "Compared with other racial groups, African Americans have a similar prevalence of CKD but are much more likely to progress to ESRD, suggesting that the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies requires dedicated study in this population. Here, we calibrated the CKD Health Policy Model so that it accurately forecasts the higher rates for ESRD observed for African Americans. We then used the calibrated model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for microalbuminuria followed by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II-receptor blockers. Incorporating racial differences in risk factors did not fully explain the much higher lifetime incidence of ESRD among African Americans. Thus, to calibrate the model, we applied a 20% increase in the rate of GFR decline at stage 3 and a 60% increase in the rate of GFR decline at stage 4, which resulted in a model that closely reflects lifetime ESRD incidence among African Americans. Compared with usual care, screening African Americans for microalbuminuria at 10-, 5-, 2-, and 1-year intervals had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $9000, $11,000, $19,000, and $35,000 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the same screening intervals were higher for non-African Americans: $17,000, $23,000, $44,000, and $81,000 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. In summary, these models suggest that screening African Americans for microalbuminuria at either 5- or 10-year intervals is highly cost-effective.",

No validation procedures have been introduced to verify the correct selection of the concentration-time (C-T) points used for the kel calculation. The purpose of this paper is to discover whether kel analysis can be subjected to the condensed validation procedure and what acceptance criteria should be adopted for such a procedure. For the analysis, data collected during bioequivalence studies of 4 drugs were selected, including 2 highly lipophilic drugs (itraconazole, atorvastatin) and 2 weakly lipophilic drugs (trimetazidine, perindopril). Pharmacokinetic calculations were performed with the use of WinNonlin Professional v 5.3. Internal validation of the kel analysis using leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. The present analysis proves that the C-T selection process for the kel calculations cannot be automated. In each of the analysed data series there were such C-T sequences that did not meet even one of the validation criteria. This paper proposes 3 validation criteria which need to be met in order to confirm the optimal selection of C-T data to calculate kel: Q 2\u22650.6, R2\u2265 0.85, Q 2-R2<0.3, were Q 2\u2009-\u2009squared cross-validated correlation coefficient, R2\u2009-\u2009coefficient of determination).

Ten-week-old male SHRs were divided into four groups with 10 animals in each group and treated for 2 months: blank, pseudo-experimental (NS), enalapril (ENA), and LAP. The alterations of BP, plasma angiotensin II (AngII) levels, and morphological changes of left common carotid artery and the third level of superior mesenteric artery were investigated. After 2 weeks of treatment, LAP and ENA significantly decreased BP and the antihypertensive effects lasted till the end of experiment. After 2 months, LAP and ENA also significantly lowered plasma AngII levels. LAP and enalapril significantly lowered vascular medial thickness, media thickness/lumen diameter, medial cross-sectional area, and mean nuclear area of smooth muscle cells in left common carotid artery. When compared to the blank group, LAP and ENA significantly lowered the percentages of collagen fibers in the vascular area of left common carotid artery with 24.84 \u00b1 0.53, 23.36 \u00b1 0.99 versus 31.82 \u00b1 0.57 (blank), respectively, and those of the third level of superior mesenteric artery with 15.82 \u00b1 0.60, 15.15 \u00b1 0.71 versus 23.42 \u00b1 0.72, respectively.

Conversely, clinical trials have consistently shown that effective blood pressure control within the recommended targets can be achieved in 70-80% of treated hypertensive patients with different cardiovascular risk profile, especially when appropriate, effective and well tolerated combination therapies are used. In order to bridge the gap between current and optimal blood pressure control rates and to achieve a more effective cardiovascular prevention, the Italian Society of Hypertension has recently developed an interventional strategy that aims to approximate 70% of treated controlled patients by 2015. This ambitious goal can be realistically achieved by the appropriate use of modern aids and tools, also including the implementation of combination therapy, especially if this approach can be simplified into a single pill, now available in Italy. At present, 70-80% of hypertensive patients require combination therapies based on at least two classes of antihypertensive drugs to achieve the recommended blood pressure goals. It is therefore of paramount importance to implement this strategy in routine clinical practice. Among the different combination therapies, the use of combination strategies based on drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, combined with diuretics and/or calcium-channel blockers, have demonstrated to significantly reduce the rates of major cardiovascular events and discontinuations from prescribed therapies, resulting in higher antihypertensive efficacy and better tolerability than monotherapy. The present document of the Italian Society of Hypertension aims to provide main indications for implementing combination therapy in the clinical management of hypertension in order to improve blood pressure control in Italy.", 
    "268": "Heart failure and myocardial infarction result in considerable consumption of healthcare resources. Therefore, there is interest in the availability of drug therapies that can favorably modify their prognosis in the post-acute phase, reducing mortality and rehospitalization rates. Aldosterone antagonists represent a class of drugs which offer advantages in these settings, in addition to those obtained with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, even though attention should be drawn to their potential adverse effects. In particular, eplerenone exhibits a better safety profile than spironolactone. Since it has very little affinity for glucocorticoid, androgen and progesterone receptors, eplerenone has less antiandrogenic and progestagenic effects, resulting in a lower incidence of gynecomastia. The EPHESUS study showed that eplerenone can reduce mortality in the short and long term and the rate of new hospitalizations after a myocardial infarction complicated by heart failure. In addition, in the EMPHASIS-HF study eplerenone reduced cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations after mild heart failure (NYHA class IIa). Despite these important results, which confirmed those obtained with spironolactone in severe heart failure in the RALES study, aldosterone antagonists are still underutilized. In particular, eplerenone is not yet available in Italy, although it is recommended by the latest European Society of Cardiology guidelines.",

There is a paucity of data concerning the correction of anemia in the posttransplant period with erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESA). The aim of this study was to compare the iron status, kidney function, inflammatory state, use of drugs affecting erythropoiesis (immunosuppressants ACEi/ARB) and correction of anemia using ESA in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) population versus kidney transplant recipients. We included 67 patients treated with ESA including 17 after kidney transplantation. CKD Patients with native kidneys were significantly older than allograft recipients (mean age 69 versus 51 years; P < .001, and despite similar serum creatinine and iron parameters showed an estimated lower GFR (19 mL/min versus 23 mL/min; P < .05). Median time of ESA therapy was similar among patients with native kidney CKD versus kidney recipients, but they achieved a significantly higher hemoglobin (11.04 versus 10.36 g/dL; P < .05). There was no difference between patients administered or not a mammalian target of rapamycin antagonist. None of the patients with native kidney CKD received immunosuppressive therapy, but they were prescribed ACEi more often than kidney recipients. The higher degree of anemia in kidney allograft recipient is the most probably attributed to the use of immunosuppressive drugs, despite their better kidney function and comparable iron status. This study suggested that higher doses of ESA should be employed to anemia in kidney transplant recipients.",

The in vitro antioxidant activity, ACE-inhibition activity and surface hydrophobicities of the hydrolysates were measured in order to determine if peptides with dual functionalities were present. Dual functional peptides have both biological (e.g. antioxidant, ACE-inhibition, opioid activities) and technological (e.g. nanoemulsification abilities) functions in food systems. Heat pre-treatment marginally enhanced the hydrolysis of WPI by pepsin and trypsin but had no effect on WPI hydrolysis with chymotrypsin. With the exception of the hydrolysis by trypsin, heat pre-treatment did not affect the peptide profile of the hydrolysates as analysed using size exclusion chromatography, or the antioxidant activity (P>0.05). Heat pre-treatment significantly affected the ACE-inhibition activities and the surface hydrophobicities of the hydrolysates (P<0.05), which was a function of the specificity of the hydrolysing enzyme. Extended hydrolysis (up to 24 h) had no significant effect on the DH and the molecular weight profiles (P>0.05) but in some instances caused a reduction in the antioxidant activity of WPI hydrolysates. The chymotrypsin hydrolysate showed a broad MW size range, and was followed by pepsin and then trypsin. The bioactivities of the hydrolysates generally decreased in the order; chymotrypsin>trypsin>pepsin. This study showed that by manipulating protein conformation with pre-hydrolysis heat treatment, combined with careful enzyme selection, peptides with dual functionalities can be produced from WPI for use as functional ingredients in the manufacture of functional foods.",

The model is generated through a generalised linear model, with a gamma distribution that yields a coefficient of determination of 94.4%. The whole C-terminal pentapeptide information is a determinant for modelling the ACE inhibition activity of oligopeptides. Starting from the C-terminus, the C-1 position is the most relevant position in the model; this is followed by position C-4. In C-1, there is a preference for aliphatic and tiny residues. However, in the C-4 position, the model indicates a clear preference for bulky hydrophobic amino acids and for sulphur-containing amino acids.

    "287": "Background. Liver fibrosis is accelerated in HIV and hepatitis C coinfection, mediated by profibrotic effects of angiotensin. The objective of this study was to determine if angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) attenuate liver fibrosis in coinfection. Methods. A retrospective review of 156 coinfected subjects was conducted to analyze the association between exposure to ACE-Is and liver fibrosis. Noninvasive indices of liver fibrosis (APRI, FIB-4, Forns indices) were compared between subjects who had taken ACE-Is and controls who had not taken them. Linear regression was used to evaluate ACE-I use as an independent predictor of fibrosis. Results. Subjects taking ACE-Is for three years were no different than controls on the APRI and the FIB-4 but had significantly higher scores than controls on the Forns index, indicating more advanced fibrosis. The use of ACE-Is for three years remained independently associated with an elevated Forns score when adjusted for age, race, and HIV viral load (P < 0.001). There were significant associations between all of the indices and significant fibrosis, as determined clinically and radiologically. Conclusions. There was not a protective association between angiotensin inhibition and liver fibrosis in coinfection. These noninvasive indices may be useful for ruling out significant fibrosis in coinfection.", 
    "288": "The role of arterial hypertension (HT) as risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) is still debated. Case-control and retrospective studies do not support an association between HT and PD and the risk of PD seems to be lower in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects. In addition, the use of calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors seems to have a protective effect on the risk of developing PD. In clinical practice, a crucial finding in subjects with PD is the high supine systolic blood pressure (SBP) coupled with orthostatic hypotension (OH). It is not clear whether this SBP load could be a risk factor for target organ damage as this load can be largely due to the drugs used to treat OH (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate, midodrine) or PD itself (i.e., monoamine oxidase inhibitors, dopamine D2-receptor antagonists). This blood pressure (BP) load is largely independent of medications as the 40 % of subjects with PD have a non-dipping pattern of BP during 24 h ambulatory monitoring (24-h ABPM). In PD, nocturnal HT is usually asymptomatic and 24-h ABPM should be used to track both supine HT and OH. Treatment of HT in PD is difficult because the reduction of supine BP could worsen OH. To avoid this, short-acting dihydropyridine CCBs, clonidine or nitrates are recommended, assuming between meals, in late afternoon or in the evening in avoiding an aggravation in the post-prandial hypotension characteristic of PD.",

Cardiovascular health was assessed by a disease score (DS), which combines the following tests of cardiovascular function and structure: resting BP, large- and small-artery elasticity (SAE), BP response to exercise, retinal vasculature analysis, electrocardiogram, carotid intima-medial thickness, left ventricular mass, microalbuminuria and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide. DS was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 9 months of therapy and 1 month after discontinuation of therapy. All active treatment groups displayed a sustained reduction in BP during 9 months of treatment, with the greatest reduction in the cardvedilol+lisinopril group. DS and SAE improved in all the treatment groups but the changes were of borderline significance and exhibited no evidence for progressive improvement from 3 months (functional) to 9 months (structural). All changes were reversed within 1 month after discontinuation of therapy. We conclude that 9 months of treatment with carvedilol, lisinopril or their combination produce a sustained and well-tolerated functional improvement but not a structural improvement, perhaps because of a lack of the nitric oxide-enhancing effects of other agents that inhibit structural changes in the vasculature.",

Blood pressure was significantly reduced by valsartan, and it was further reduced by the combination therapies. Vascular endothelial dysfunction was significantly attenuated in all therapeutic groups, and further significant attenuation was observed in the valsartan+cilnidipine-treated group, but not in the valsartan+amlodipine-treated group. Vascular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase subunit NOX1 gene expression was significantly attenuated in all therapeutic groups, and significantly greater attenuation was observed in the valsartan+cilnidipine-treated group than in the valsartan-treated group. Compared with the valsartan-treated group, the positive areas for 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal were significantly lower only in the valsartan+cilnidipine-treated group. Plasma renin activity was significantly augmented in the valsartan-treated group, and it was significantly attenuated in the valsartan+cilnidipine-treated group. A significant increase in the ratio of plasma angiotensin-(1-7) to angiotensin II was observed only in the valsartan+cilnidipine-treated group. Vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene expression was significantly attenuated only in the valsartan+cilnidipine-treated group, but ACE2 gene expression was significantly higher in all of the therapeutic groups. Thus, valsartan and cilnidipine combination therapy might have a powerful protective effect in the vascular tissues via increases in the angiotensin-(1-7)/angiotensin II ratio in plasma.",

However, the effect of factors such as antihypertensive agents on residual renal function preservation has not been investigated adequately in prevalent hemodialysis patients. This study examined factors related to the rate of residual renal function preservation in 1-year hemodialysis patients who had residual renal function. We enrolled 191 consecutive maintenance hemodialysis patients who underwent hemodialysis for 1 year and maintained a urine output of more than 200 mL/day, to assess residual renal function loss. The rate of residual renal function loss was 19.9%. Multivariate analysis using residual renal function as the dependent variable revealed significant independent relationships with renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use (hazard ratio, 0.438; P = 0.027), history of cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 2.475; P = 0.024), and rate of weight gain between dialysis sessions (hazard ratio, 1.348; P = 0.013). No relationship was observed with calcium channel blocker use. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitor use, rate of body weight gain between dialysis sessions, and cardiovascular diseases are independently associated with residual renal function preservation in patients with residual renal function after 1 year of hemodialysis. A further intervention study is required to investigate whether treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and suppression of body weight gain preserves residual renal function for a longer time in hemodialysis patients.",

Guidelines are available to help prescribers deal with these drug associations, but their implementation is not well evaluated. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of NSAIDs exposure in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs, using the French Pharmacovigilance database, and explore the ADRs related to DDIs between antihypertensive drugs and NSAIDs. Over the 11,\u00a0442 notifications of ADRs recorded in this database in patients treated with oral antihypertensive drugs between 2008 and 2010, 517 (4.5 and 95% CI: 4.1-4.9) also included exposure to NSAIDs. These subjects were more frequently women, took more drugs in general, and were younger and less frequently treated with antiplatelet drugs. In 24.2% of them (125 patients), a DDI between NSAIDs and antihypertensive drugs was potentially the cause of the reported ADR. Acute renal failure caused by DDIs between NSAIDs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or diuretics was the most frequently reported ADR (20.7%). Finally, in the French Pharmacovigilance database, around one-fourth of associations NSAIDs\u00a0 + \u00a0antihypertensive drugs are associated with a 'serious' ADR (mainly acute renal failure), suggesting that this well-known DDI is not enough taken into account by prescribers.",

Moreover, the temporal relationship between development of fibrosis, inflammation and lymphangiogenesis in chronic progressive kidney disease is not clear yet. Therefore, we evaluated the time course of lymph vessel (LV) formation in relation to proteinuria and interstitial damage in a rat model of chronic unilateral adriamycin nephrosis. Proteinuria and kidneys were evaluated up to 30 weeks after induction of nephrosis. LVs were identified by podoplanin/VEGFR3 double staining. After 6 weeks proteinuria was well-established, without influx of interstitial macrophages and myofibroblasts, collagen deposition, osteopontin expression (tubular activation) or LV formation. At 12 weeks, a \u223c3-fold increase in cortical LV density was found (p<0.001), gradually increasing over time. This corresponded with a significant increase in tubular osteopontin expression (p<0.01) and interstitial myofibroblast numbers (p<0.05), whereas collagen deposition and macrophage numbers were not yet increased. VEGF-C was mostly expressed by tubular cells rather than interstitial cells. Cultured tubular cells stimulated with FCS showed a dose-dependent increase in mRNA and protein expression of VEGF-C which was not observed by human albumin stimulation. We conclude that chronic proteinuria provoked lymphangiogenesis in temporal conjunction with tubular osteopontin expression and influx of myofibroblasts, that preceded interstitial fibrosis.",

In the present study, 17 flavonoids belonging to five structural subtypes were evaluated in vitro for their ability to inhibit ACE in order to establish the structural basis of their bioactivity. The ACE inhibitory (ACEI) activity of these 17 flavonoids was determined by fluorimetric method at two concentrations (500 \u00b5M and 100 \u00b5M). Their inhibitory potencies ranged from 17 to 95% at 500 \u00b5M and from 0 to 57% at 100 \u00b5M. In both cases, the highest ACEI activity was obtained for luteolin. Following the determination of ACEI activity, the flavonoids with higher ACEI activity (i.e., ACEI >60% at 500 \u00b5M) were selected for further IC(50) determination. The IC(50) values for luteolin, quercetin, rutin, kaempferol, rhoifolin and apigenin K were 23, 43, 64, 178, 183 and 196 \u00b5M, respectively. Our results suggest that flavonoids are an excellent source of functional antihypertensive products. Furthermore, our structure-activity relationship studies show that the combination of sub-structures on the flavonoid skeleton that increase ACEI activity is made up of the following elements: (a) the catechol group in the B-ring, (b) the double bond between C2 and C3 at the C-ring, and (c) the cetone group in C4 at the C-ring.

ACEI-related angioedema is never accompanied by urticaria and occurs via a kinin-dependent mechanism. ACEI-related angioedema not only can start years after beginning the treatment, but it can then recur irregularly while under that treatment. Furthermore, allergy tests are unreliable for the diagnosis of ACEI-related angioedema, and so the relationship between angioedema and ACEIs is often missed and consequently quite underestimated.

The pathophysiological significance of alternative Ang II-forming pathways in human cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Although chymase inhibitors, unlike ACE inhibitors and Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), may only play a small role in the regulation of the systemic RAS, the possible applications of chymase inhibitors as new drugs that inhibit the local RAS to prevent cardiovascular diseases are described in animal models.

    "349": "Recent evidence demonstrated that dysregulation of adipocytokine functions seen in abdominal obesity may be involved in the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. Angiotensinogen, the precursor of angiotensin (Ang) II, is produced primarily in the liver, and also in adipose tissue, where it is up-regulated during the development of obesity and involved in blood pressure regulation and adipose tissue growth. Blockade of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) attenuates weight gain and adiposity by enhanced energy expenditure, and the favorable metabolic effects of telmisartan have been related to its Ang II receptor blockade and action as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferators activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3. PPAR\u03b3 plays an important role in regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and ligands for PPAR\u03b3 can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce triglyceride levels. Similarly, bone metabolism is closely regulated by hormones and cytokines, which have effects on both bone resorption and deposition. It is known that the receptors of Ang II are expressed in culture osteoclasts and osteoblasts, and Ang II is postulated to be able to act upon the cells involved in bone metabolism. In in vitro system, Ang II induced the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts responsible for bone resorption. Importantly, it was demonstrated by the sub-analysis of a recent clinical study that the fracture risk was significantly reduced by the usage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. To treat the subgroups of hypertensive patients with osteoporosis RAS can be considered a novel target.", 
    "350": "Current national guidelines have recommended the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, including angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), in preference to other antihypertensive agents for treating hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease. However, the mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects of ARBs are multiple and complex. Blood pressure reduction by systemic vasodilation with an ARB contributes to its beneficial effects in treating kidney disease. Furthermore, ARB-induced renal vasodilation results in an increase in renal blood flow, leading to improvement of renal ischemia and hypoxia. ARBs are also effective in reducing urinary albumin excretion through a reduction in intraglomerular pressure and the protection of glomerular endothelium and/or podocyte injuries. In addition to blocking angiotensin II-induced renal cell and tissue injuries, ARBs can decrease intrarenal angiotensin II levels by reducing proximal tubular angiotensinogen and production of collecting duct renin, as well as angiotensin II accumulation in the kidney. In this review, we will briefly summarize our current understanding of the pharmacological effects of an ARB in the kidney. We will also discuss the possible mechanisms responsible for the renoprotective effects of ARBs on type 2 diabetic nephropathy.",

A large number of genetic investigations have been carried out to examine the association between gene variants of RAS and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke. Even though the major results were obtained from genetic association studies of angiotensinogen or angiotensin converting enzyme, unique findings were also elucidated from investigations concerning single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 2 types of angioteinsin II receptor genes denoted as AGTR1 and AGTR2. Both genes have many SNPs in the coding and its flanking regions but most of the studies used A1166C polymorphism of AGTR1 and G1675A polymorphism of AGTR2. In the subjects with C1166 allele of AGTR1, several investigations reported increased risk for coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease but not for hypertension. Interestingly, a few papers pointed out the possibility that A1166C modulates the efficacy of RAS inhibitors. In the genetic analysis of AGTR2, G1675 allele carriers had increased risk for left ventricular hypertrophy, renal insufficiency and modulated hemodynamic response to RAS inhibitors. In this review, we summarized previous investigations concerning the genetic aspects of AGTR1 and AGTR2 to consider the clinical utility of SNPs of these receptors.",

The aim of study was to determine the influence of aliskiren on stasis-induced venous thrombosis in renovascular hypertensive and normotensive rats. The involvement of nitric oxide and prostacyclin in the potential antithrombotic action was also elucidated. Six weeks after clipping of the left renal artery rats developed hypertension which was confirmed by the \"tail cuff\" method. Hypertensive and normotensive rats were treated with aliskiren (10, 30 and 100mg/kg/day) per os for 10days. Venous thrombosis was induced by stasis of vena cava inferior. Aliskiren at the highest dose induced a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive, but did not change this parameter in normotensive rats. Oral administration of aliskiren resulted in dose-dependent decrease of venous thrombus weight in hypertensive and normotensive rats. The antithrombotic activity of aliskiren was abolished both by NO synthase inhibitor and prostacyclin synthesis inhibitor. Aliskiren decreased collagen-induced platelet aggregation, increased plasma level of tissue plasminogen activator activity whereas no changes in plasminogen activator inhibitor activity and coagulation parameters were found. We showed that aliskiren prevents the development of venous thrombosis by enhanced fibrinolysis and the blood platelet inhibition via nitric oxide and/or prostacyclin-dependent mechanism.",

ABP recordings (Diasys Integra II) were obtained in 112 participants at baseline and 186 after an average follow-up of 13 months. At baseline, clinic blood pressure (CBP) exceeded the morning ABP by 32/10 mm Hg. Fifty percent of participants fulfilled the established criteria for white coat hypertension.

During follow-up, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure placebo-active differences averaged 6/5 mm Hg for morning ABP, 8/5 mm Hg for 24-hour ABP, and 13/5 mm Hg for CBP. The lowering of blood pressure over 24 hours supports the reduction in blood pressure with indapamide sustained release\u00b1perindopril as the explanation for the reduction in total mortality and cardiovascular events observed in the main HYVET study.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the antihypertensive and heart rate (HR)-lowering effect of milk fermented by specific L. lactis in a murine model. Spontaneously hypertensive male rats (271 (SD14) g) were randomised into four treatment groups that were orally administered with milk fermented by L. lactis NRRL B-50 571 or L. lactis NRRL B-50 572 at 35 or 50 mg protein/kg body weight (BW), respectively. Further, two more groups were fed with different solutions as controls: a saline solution as the negative control and Captopril (40 mg/kg BW), a proven ACE inhibitor, as the positive control. Blood pressure and HR were monitored by the tail-cuff method before the treatments and at 2, 4, 6 and 24 h post-oral administration. The results demonstrated that milk fermented by L. lactis NRRL B-50 571 as well as by L. lactis NRRL B-50 572 presented an important systolic and diastolic blood pressure- and HR-lowering effect. Thus, milk fermented by specific L. lactis strains may present potential benefits in the prevention and treatment of CVD associated with hypertension in humans.",

However, this idea has been challenged following the development of RAAS blockers, including renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, type 1 angiotensin II (AT(1))-receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists. Consequently, new RAAS components and pathways that might contribute to the effectiveness of these drugs and/or their adverse effects have been identified. For example, an increase in renin levels during RAAS blockade might result in harmful effects via stimulation of the prorenin receptor (PRR), and prorenin-the inactive precursor of renin-might gain enzymatic activity on PRR binding. The increase in angiotensin II levels that occurs during AT(1)-receptor blockade might result in beneficial effects via stimulation of type 2 angiotensin II receptors. Moreover, angiotensin 1-7 levels increase during ACE inhibition and AT(1)-receptor blockade, resulting in Mas receptor activation and the induction of cardioprotective and renoprotective effects, including stimulation of tissue repair by stem cells. Finally, a role of angiotensin II in sodium and potassium handling in the distal nephron has been identified. This finding is likely to have important implications for understanding the effects of RAAS inhibition on whole body sodium and potassium balance.",

    "393": "Human muscle undergoes constant changes. After about age 50, muscle mass decreases at an annual rate of 1-2\u00a0%. Muscle strength declines by 1.5\u00a0% between ages 50 and 60 and by 3\u00a0% thereafter. The reasons for these changes include denervation of motor units and a net conversion of fast type II muscle fibers into slow type I fibers with resulting loss in muscle power necessary for activities of daily living. In addition, lipids are deposited in the muscle, but these changes do not usually lead to a loss in body weight. Once muscle mass in elderly subjects falls below 2 standard deviations of the mean of a young control cohort and the gait speed falls below 0.8\u00a0m/s, a clinical diagnosis of sarcopenia can be reached. Assessment of muscle strength using tests such as the short physical performance battery test, the timed get-up-and-go test, or the stair climb power test may also be helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Serum markers may be useful when sarcopenia presence is suspected and may prompt further investigations. Indeed, sarcopenia is one of the four main reasons for loss of muscle mass. On average, it is estimated that 5-13\u00a0% of elderly people aged 60-70\u00a0years are affected by sarcopenia. The numbers increase to 11-50\u00a0% for those aged 80 or above. Sarcopenia may lead to frailty, but not all patients with sarcopenia are frail-sarcopenia is about twice as common as frailty. Several studies have shown that the risk of falls is significantly elevated in subjects with reduced muscle strength. Treatment of sarcopenia remains challenging, but promising results have been obtained using progressive resistance training, testosterone, estrogens, growth hormone, vitamin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Interesting nutritional interventions include high-caloric nutritional supplements and essential amino acids that support muscle fiber synthesis.",

The aim of this study was to design patient information leaflets for hydrochlorothiazide, nifedipine and enalapril with content indicated by patients as relevant and to evaluate them against the SDM. Patient information leaflet (PIL) for each drug was designed to contain information on name, use of drug, how it works, how it is to be taken, common side effects, storage, missed dose action, things to avoid and when to contact the physician. Appropriateness was assessed by 10 practising pharmacists. For each drug, 40 patients were recruited, of which 20 were given SDM and 20 PIL. The knowledge of each participant was examined before and after exposure to SDM or PIL, as well as opinion on ease of reading and attractiveness using Pearson s Chi-square analysis. The results showed that both SDM and PIL improved knowledge of common side effects when compared with responses before exposure (chi2 = 24.26 for SDM and 27.64 for PIL, p < 0.001) with no difference between the groups. Respondents receiving PILs were better able to recall \"things to avoid\" after exposure to PIL (chi2 =10.85, p < 0.001). After exposure to SDM or PIL, the respondents who received PIL were more aware of when to contact the physician, compared to the SDM group (chi2 = 8.41, p < 0.01). When compared with SDM, respondents receiving PIL were more likely to indicate that PIL was easy to read (chi2 = 20.00, p < 0.001), attractive (chi2 = 12.45, p < 0.001) and they were more likely to recommend distribution of their reading material to other patients (chi2 = 22.11, p < 0.001).

A systematic literature search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library was conducted for randomized controlled trials. Weighted mean differences and relative risk with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for continuous and dichotomous data, respectively. In all, 14 studies with 6741 participants were included in the present meta-analysis. Nine studies included trial arms with placebo, four included angiotensin (Ang) AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), three included Ang-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), two included calcium channel blockers (CCBs), one included a \u03b2-blocker, and one included hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). We found that aliskiren, which lowered blood pressure (BP) effectively in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, was similar to HCTZ but inferior to CCBs in BP reduction, response rates and control rates. Furthermore, aliskiren was superior to ACEIs in lowering diastolic BP (DBP), while it had similar effects to ACEIs on systolic BP (SBP) reduction, response rates and control rates. Additionally, the present meta-analysis showed the superiority of atenolol over aliskiren in DBP reduction and BP response but showed that atenolol was inferior in SBP reduction and BP control. No difference was found in the rates of therapeutic response between aliskiren and ARBs, while more patients achieved BP control with aliskiren. Further studies will be needed to determine the antihypertensive effects and tolerability of aliskiren in comparison with other antihypertensive drugs.",

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, and the mechanisms underlying ACE regulation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We used Tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for cell viability, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay for cell apoptosis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for cAMP measurement, real-time PCR for mRNA detection, and Western blot for protein analysis in the study. Our results demonstrated that H2O2 (50-1000 \u03bcM) decreased HUVECs viability by inducing apoptosis. Notably, H2O2 upregulated ACE expression in a concentration-dependent manner. H2O2 100 \u03bcM significantly enhanced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) expression by 1.48-fold (P<0.05). Additionally, forskolin 10 \u03bcM, a cAMP agonist, was also found to enhance ACE expression by 1.78-fold (P<0.05); in contrast, H-89 10 \u03bcM, a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, abolished H2O2-induced ACE expression and prevented the enhancing effect of forskolin-induced ACE expression. Similar effects on ACE mRNA were also observed. cAMP-response element-specific decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (CRE-dODN) containing binding sites for cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) inhibited ACE expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Negative control CRE-dODN had no effect on ACE expression. We conclude that H2O2 upregulates the expression of ACE through the activation of cAMP/PKA/CREB signal pathway in HUVECs, indicating a role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology of hypertension.",

Enalapril was administered chronically for 2 weeks to subsets of STZ (streptozotocin)-induced DM and vehicle-treated sham rats. O(2)(-) (superoxide anion) and NO(x) (nitrate+nitrite) levels were measured in the media bathing renal cortical slices after 90 min incubation in vitro. SOD (superoxide dismutase) activity and 3-NT content were measured in the renal cortex homogenate. Renal cortical nitrated protein was identified by proteomic analysis. Renal cortical production of O(2)(-) and 3-NT was increased in DM rats; however, enalapril suppressed these changes. DM rats also exhibited elevated renal cortical NO(x) production and SOD activity, and these changes were magnified by enalapril treatment. 2-DE (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis)-based Western blotting revealed more than 20 spots with positive 3-NT immunoreactivity in the renal cortex of DM rats. Enalapril treatment blunted the DM-induced increase in tyrosine nitration of three proteins ACO2, GDH1 and MMSDH (aconitase 2, glutamate dehydrogenase 1 and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase), each of which resides in mitochondria. These data are consistent with enalapril preventing DM-induced tyrosine nitration of mitochondrial proteins by a mechanism involving suppression of oxidant production and enhancement of antioxidant capacity, including SOD activation.",

A retrospective review of 211 children (794 KCl doses) undergoing cardiac surgery or a hospital stay for heart failure in the CICU of a tertiary care teaching and referral children's hospital in 2011 was performed. Demographic data, weight, height, creatinine, and concomitant medications during each KCl dose were recorded and analyzed.

    "533": "The link between the kidney and hypertension has been considered a villain-victim relationship because of the potential two-way causality between high blood pressure (BP) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Arterial hypertension (AH) per se, but also together with diabetes mellitus, is the most important cause of CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the developed world. Pathophysiologicaly, the increment in systemic BP leads to the rise in glomerular pressure. Glomerular hypertension results in glomerular capillary wall stretch, endothelial damage and a rise in protein glomerular filtration. These processes, in turn, cause changes of mesangial and proximal tubular cells, ultimately resulting in the replacement of functional by non-functional connective tissue and the development of fibrosis. One of the most important factors in the progression of CKD is activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Its effect is not only elevated BP, but also the promotion of cell proliferation, inflammation and matrix accumulation. The terms that clinicians use to identify renal damage associated with hypertension are nephrosclerosis, benign nephrosclerosis, hypertensive kidney disease, or nephroangiosclerosis. Many studies, first in experimental animals and later in humans, have shown that the lowering of BP (and proteinuria) is associated with a slower progression of CKD. It seems that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI's) are more renoprotective than other antihypertensives (the protection beyond the antihypertensive effect), although some studies have also confirmed a comparatively beneficial effect of non-dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Moreover, it seems that a combination of antihypertensives (e.g. ACEI, CCB, and ARB) has a more effective action than either of the drugs alone. The effects depend first on the degree of BP reduction. The strict BP control has been considered the basis of therapy for slowing renal deterioration.",

Other sequences yielded a moderate ACE inhibition. Results from this study show that Spanish dry-cured ham may represent a source of natural peptides with potential benefit for human health.", 
    "544": "Hyperglycaemia up-regulates intracellular AngII (angiotensin II) production in cardiac myocytes, effects of which are blocked more effectively by renin inhibition than ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers) or ACEis (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). In the present study, we determined whether renin inhibition is more effective at preventing diabetic cardiomyopathy than an ARB or ACEi. Diabetes was induced in adult mice for 10 weeks by STZ (streptozotocin). Diabetic mice were treated with insulin, aliskiren (a renin inhibitor), benazeprilat (an ACEi) or valsartan (an ARB) via subcutaneous mini-pumps. Significant impairment in diastolic and systolic cardiac functions was observed in diabetic mice, which was completely prevented by all three RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibitors. Hyperglycaemia significantly increased cardiac oxidative stress and circulating inflammatory cytokines, which were blocked by aliskiren and benazeprilat, whereas valsartan was partially effective. Diabetes increased cardiac PRR (prorenin receptor) expression and nuclear translocation of PLZF (promyelocytic zinc finger protein), which was completely prevented by aliskiren and valsartan, and partially by benazeprilat. Renin inhibition provided similar protection of cardiac function to ARBs and ACEis. Activation of PLZF by PRR represented a novel mechanism in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Differential effects of the three agents on oxidative stress, cytokines and PRR expression suggested subtle differences in their mechanisms of action.", 
    "545": "The renal distal tubule Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) reabsorbs <10% of the filtered Na(+) but is a key control point for blood pressure regulation by angiotensin II (ANG II), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and thiazide diuretics. This study aimed to determine whether NCC phosphorylation (NCCp) was regulated by acute (20-30 min) treatment with the ACEI captopril (12 \u03bcg/min \u00d7 20 min) or by a sub-pressor dose of ANG II (20 ng\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1)) in Inactin-anesthetized rats. By immuno-EM, NCCp was detected exclusively in or adjacent to apical plama membranes (APM) in controls and after ACEI or ANG II treatment, while NCC total was detected in both APM and subapical cytoplasmic vesicles (SCV) in all conditions. In renal homogenates, neither ACEI nor ANG II treatment altered NCCp abundance, assayed by immunoblot. However, by density gradient fractionation we identified a pool of low-density APM in which NCCp decreased 50% in response to captopril and was restored during ANG II infusion, and another pool of higher-density APM that responded reciprocally, indicative of regulated redistribution between two APM pools. In both pools, NCCp was preferentially localized to Triton-soluble membranes. Blue Native gel electrophoresis established that APM NCCp localized to ~700 kDa complexes (containing \u03b3-adducin) while unphosphorylated NCC in intracellular membranes primarily localized to ~400 kDa complexes: there was no evidence for native monomeric or dimeric NCC or NCCp. In summary, this study demonstrates that phosphorylated NCC, localized to multimeric complexes in the APM, redistributes in a regulated manner within the APM in response to ACEI and ANG II.",

Adequate separation was achieved using silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates and ethyl acetate-methanol-toluene-ammonia solution, 33% (6.5:2:1:0.5 by volume), as a developing system. The second method was based on high-performance liquid chromatography, by which the proposed components were separated on a reversed-phase C18 analytical column using a mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer (pH 2.5, 0.01 M)-acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran (60:40:0.1% by volume) with ultraviolet detection at 218 nm. Different parameters affecting the suggested methods were optimized for maximum separation of the cited components. System suitability parameters of the two developed methods were also tested.

Microalbuminuria is a marker of endothelial dysfunction, which is a promoter of atherosclerosis. In type 1 diabetes, intensive glucose control decreases the microalbuminuria risk by 20-30%. In patients with this type of diabetes, microalbuminuria prevention is associated with a significant reduction of cardiovascular events. In type 2 diabetes, good metabolic control is similarly effective in microalbuminuria prevention, as shown by the ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT studies. The role of renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the prevention of microalbuminuria is still unclear. In type 1 diabetes, there are no studies available showing that drugs inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system are able to prevent albuminuria. In patients with type 2 diabetes there are contrasting data: ACE-inhibitors prevent the appearance of microalbuminuria, while angiotensin receptor blockers do not prevent albuminuria or are associated with adverse effects. Therefore in type 2 diabetes patients with normoalbuminuria there is evidence that ACE inhibitors are effective in preventing microalbuminuria only in those patients with hypertension. In these patients good metabolic control and ACE inhibitor therapy are clearly able to prevent microalbuminuria.",

    "573": "High intestinal sodium absorption is one mechanism of hypertension and constipation. The sodium-proton-exchanger subtype 3 (NHE3) is an important mediator of sodium absorption in the gut. SAR218034 (SAR) is an orally nonabsorbable specific NHE3 inhibitor. The effect of SAR (1 mg/kg per day in chow) on feces sodium excretion, systolic blood pressure via tail cuff, and gene expression of NHE3 in the gut were studied in senescent lean hypertensive rats (spontaneously hypertensive rats-lean, loaded with NaCl 0.7% in drinking water) and in hypertensive, obese, and hyperinsulinemic rats (spontaneously hypertensive rats-obese, not loaded with NaCl). In spontaneously hypertensive rats-lean, inhibition of intestinal NHE3 by SAR increased feces sodium excretion and reduced urinary sodium excretion, whereas absolute sodium balance and serum sodium concentration were not changed. This suggests reduced intestinal sodium absorption in SAR-treated animals and was associated with increased feces water content (58% versus 42% in placebo treated animals; P=0.0001) and reduction in systolic blood pressure from 222 \u00b1 7 to 198 \u00b1 2 mm Hg (P=0.0001). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by ramipril plus NHE3 inhibition resulted in an additive blood pressure-lowering effect. In spontaneously hypertensive rats-obese, SAR lowered systolic blood pressure but did not modify serum insulin or cholesterol levels. Gene expression of NHE3 was upregulated in the ileum and colon but not in the jejunum of SAR-treated rats. Reduction of intestinal sodium absorption by selective NHE3 inhibition in the gut reduces high blood pressure and increases feces water excretion. Intestinal NHE3 blockade could be a new treatment strategy for elderly patients suffering from high blood pressure and constipation.",

The mechanism of this benefit has not been determined. After 3 weeks of lisinopril (L, 40 mg/day) run-in, 30 subjects entered a single-blinded, forced-titration, crossover study in which carvedilol (C, 20 then 40 mg/day) or a control renin-angiotensin blocker, valsartan (V, 160 then 320 mg/day) were added to L. Ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and heart rate monitoring was performed at the end of each period. Rate-pressure product (RPP, systolic BP \u00d7 heart rate, an indicator of cardiac oxygen consumption) was measured over 24 hours, daytime (6 am to midnight), and nighttime (midnight to 6 am) periods. Variability (standard deviation and range) of RPP, BP, and heart rate was also investigated. After 4\u00a0weeks, mean 24-hour systolic BP was about 8 mm Hg lower when either V or C was added to L (P < .01 each). Heart rate was consistently lower with C (8 beats/min over 24 hours, P < .000) but was slightly increased with V (about 2\u00a0beats/min, P\u00a0= NS). Consequently, C lowered RPP to a greater degree than V over 24 hours (about 8% vs. 2%, P < .000) and during daytime and nighttime periods (P < .000 each). In addition, RPP variability (SD but not range) was consistently lower on C than V. When added to L, C reduces the mean and variability (SD) of 24-hour heart rate and cardiac workload to a greater degree than valsartan. These effects may contribute to the outcome benefits observed with \u03b2-blocker-ACE inhibitor combinations.",

Therefore, treatment of post-operative AF would decrease health-care costs during hospitalization and improve the prognosis of patients following cardiovascular surgery. Current consensus guidelines recommend \u03b2-blockers, amiodarone and sotalol for post-operative AF prophylaxis. However, new pharmacological agents have been associated with a reduction in post-operative AF frequency, including inhibition of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, antioxidant agents, magnesium supplementation and antiarrhythmic drugs.

It was shown that all the patients suffered disturbances of regional cerebral blood flow even in the absence of focal neurological symptoms. Perfusion was especially impaired in the temporal, occipital and superior frontal lobes. The degree of the night-time fall in AP was related to the level of perfusion in the right temporal region (r = -0.5; p = 0.04) which confirms the danger of extreme AD decrease in hypertonics during sleep.

It was, therefore, hypothesised that ACE-2 expression might be related to cell cycle progression. To test this hypothesis, ACE-2 mRNA levels, protein levels and enzymatic activity were examined in fibrotic human lungs and in the alveolar epithelial cell lines A549 and MLE-12 studied at postconfluent (quiescent) versus subconfluent (proliferating) densities. ACE-2 mRNA, immunoreactive protein and enzymatic activity were all high in quiescent cells, but were severely downregulated or absent in actively proliferating cells. Upregulation of the enzyme in cells that were progressing to quiescence was completely inhibited by the transcription blocker actinomycin D or by SP600125, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In lung biopsy specimens obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, immunoreactive enzyme was absent in alveolar epithelia that were positive for proliferation markers, but was robustly expressed in alveolar epithelia devoid of proliferation markers. These data explain the loss of ACE-2 in lung fibrosis and demonstrate cell cycle-dependent regulation of this protective enzyme by a JNK-mediated transcriptional mechanism.", 
    "596": "As CKD continues to increase worldwide, along with the demand for related life-saving therapies, the financial burden of CKD will place an increasing drain on health care systems. Experimental studies showed that glomerular capillary hypertension and impaired sieving function with consequent protein overload play a pathogenic role in the progression of CKD. Consistently, human studies show that proteinuria is an independent predictor of progression and that its reduction is renoprotective. At comparable BP control, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), more effectively than non-RAS inhibitor therapy reduce proteinuria, slow progression to ESRD, and even improve the kidney function achieving disease regression in some cases. In participants with diabetes, RAS inhibitors delay the onset of microalbuminuria and its progression to macroalbuminuria, and ACE inhibitors may reduce the excess cardiovascular mortality associated with diabetic renal disease. In addition to RAS inhibitors, however, multimodal approaches including lifestyle modifications and multidrug therapy will be required in most cases to optimize control of the several risk factors for CKD and related cardiovascular morbidity. Whether novel medications may help further improve the cost-effectiveness of renoprotective interventions is a matter of investigation.",

Central aortic blood pressure (BP), augmentation pressure and index (AIx), carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (PWV), brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilatation (EDVD), office and ambulatory BP as well as orthostatic BP falls were evaluated under the influence of selected therapy. 27 patients completed the study protocol. Results showed that aortic systolic BP was significantly reduced by 10.7 mmHg, augmentation pressure - by 3.6 mmHg and AIx - by 6.5%. Carotid-radial PWV decreased by 0.8 m/s. Carotid-femoral PWV did not change. We also revealed the EDVD increase by week 12. The EDVD growth was correlated with degree of aortic systolic BP reduction (r=-0.48, p=0.02). Office and ambulatory BP declined by 15.8/10.0 and 10.0/7.5 mmHg respectively. The target BP &lt;140/90 mmHg was achieved in 20 (74.1%) persons.

Despite the well-documented hemodynamic abnormalities associated with the disease (e.g., elevated systemic vascular resistance), therapies that directly target these derangements have consistently failed to improve important clinical outcomes, unless they also act on the underlying pathophysiology of the disease (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors). Numerous clinical trials of vasodilators in the treatment of heart failure have resulted in either neutral or negative outcomes suggesting that systemic vascular resistance may be an inappropriate target of therapy. The reasons for failure in these studies are manifold, including a poor understanding of vasodilator agents and their secondary effects, poorly designed studies that include a markedly heterogeneous patient population and a paucity of objective end points that may be used as targets of therapy, to name a few. Future studies of vasodilators will need to consider these issues in trial design.",

AF patients have a different clinical profile: they are older, with more severe HF and comorbidities than those without AF. Despite this poor clinical profile, observational studies report a lower use of the recommended treatments such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers.

Furthermore, in patients with vascular disease, changes in albuminuria independently predict mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes, and drug-induced lowering of albuminuria with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers confers long-term cardiovascular and renal protection. However, few studies have directly examined whether these agents might also prevent the development of albuminuria and whether this translates into protection from cardiovascular disease events. The ROADMAP trial was conducted in an attempt to give answers to these questions. The results provide evidence that pharmacological blockade of angiotensin II receptors is effective in reducing the risk of new-onset albuminuria in type 2 diabetic patients. The study was not able to determine if this will also lead to a long-term reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "606": "Aldosterone, a specific mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) agonist and a key player in the development of hypertension, is synthesized as a final product of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Hypertension can be generally treated by negating the effects of angiotensin II through the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (ARBs). However, the efficacy of angiotensin II blockade by such drugs is sometimes diminished by the so-called \"aldosterone breakthrough\" effect, by which ACE-Is or ARBs (renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors) gradually lose their effectiveness against hypertension due to the overproduction of aldosterone, known as primary aldosteronism. Although MR antagonists are used to antagonize the effects of aldosterone, these drugs may, however, give rise to life-threatening adverse actions, such as hyperkalemia, particularly when used in conjunction with RAS inhibitors. Recently, several groups have reported that some dihydropyridine Ca(2+) channel blockers (CCBs) have inhibitory actions on aldosterone production in in vitro and in the clinical setting. Therefore, the use of such dihydropyridine CCBs to treat aldosterone-related hypertension may prove beneficial to circumvent such therapeutic problems. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism of action of CCBs on aldosterone production and clinical perspectives for CCB use to inhibit MR activity in hypertensive patients.",

From these models, we have learned the natural history and pathogenesis and assessed not only new diagnostic methods but also therapeutic and preventive interventions. Autoantibodies against cardiac troponin I appeared in spontaneously developing autoimmune myocarditis in PD-1 deficient mice, who lack the T-cell receptor costimulatory molecule PD-1. The passive transfer of this antibody induced myocardial dysfunction. Later, this autoantibody was found in patients with myocarditis. Mast cell deficiency had beneficial effects in the viral myocarditis model, and anti-allergic agents prevented viral myocarditis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocker and an aldosterone receptor antagonist improved viral myocarditis, suggesting that the renin-angiotension-aldosterone system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. Differential modulation of cytokine production was seen with various calcium channel blockers, and some calcium channel blocker improved viral myocarditis. Viral infection could lead to increased synthesis of immunoglobulin light chains (FLC). Serum levels of FLC were increased in myocarditis, and exogenously given FLC inhibited viral replication and improved myocarditis.

Genetic, endocrine, immunological, and environmental factors have been suggested in its pathogenesis. A great number of studies have related genetic polymorphisms as a factor that contributes to the development of endometriosis. This review presents a detailed description of the contribution of genetic polymorphisms in genes that regulate vascular function and tissue remodeling in endometriosis (alpha 2-HS glycoprotein [AHSG], epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], endostatin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1], angiotensin I-converting enzyme [ACE], and matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs]). Some polymorphisms of the VEGF (-460 C/T, +405 G/C, +936 C/T), PAI, MMP-1, 2, and 3 genes were widely studied, while polymorphisms of the AHSG, EGF, endostatin, and VEGF (-1154 G/A, -2578 A/C) genes were not. In this latter case, additional studies are required to confirm the findings of the few studies that have analyzed these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, studies that found a positive or negative association of SNP with endometriosis emphasize the relevance of studies with a large number of control cases to confirm their findings. The haplotype analysis was performed only for the VEGF (-460, +405, -1154 and -2578), ACE (-240/2350) and MMP-1, 2, 3, and 9 genes, and in most of them, there was no association with endometriosis.

Furthermore, methods of augmentation of the EPR effect are described, that result in better tumor delivery and improved therapeutic effect, where nitroglycerin, angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or angiotensin II-induced hypertension are employed. Consequently, better therapeutic effect and reduced systemic toxicity are generally observed. Obviously, the EPR effect based delivery of nanoprobes are also useful for tumor-selective imaging agents with using fluorescent or radio nuclei in nanoprobes. We also commented a key difference between passive tumor targeting and the EPR effect in tumors, particularly as related to drug retention in tumors: passive targeting of low-molecular-weight X-ray contrast agents involves a retention period of less than a few minutes, whereas the EPR effect of nanoparticles involves a prolonged retention time-days to weeks.", 
    "641": "Proximal arterial stiffening is an important predictor of events in systemic and pulmonary hypertension, partly through its contribution to downstream vascular abnormalities. However, much remains undetermined regarding the mechanisms involved in the vascular changes induced by arterial stiffening. We therefore addressed the hypothesis that high pulsatility flow, caused by proximal arterial stiffening, induces downstream pulmonary artery endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction that in turn leads to phenotypic change of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To test the hypothesis, we employed a model pulmonary circulation in which upstream compliance regulates the pulsatility of flow waves imposed onto a downstream vascular mimetic coculture composed of pulmonary ECs and SMCs. The effects of high pulsatility flow on SMCs were determined both in the presence and absence of ECs. In the presence of ECs, high pulsatility flow increased SMC size and expression of the contractile proteins, smooth muscle \u03b1-actin (SMA) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), without affecting proliferation. In the absence of ECs, high pulsatility flow decreased SMC expression of SMA and SM-MHC, without affecting SMC size or proliferation. To identify the molecular signals involved in the EC-mediated SMC responses, mRNA and/or protein expression of vasoconstrictors [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and endothelin (ET)-1], vasodilator (eNOS), and growth factor (TGF-\u03b21) in EC were examined. Results showed high pulsatility flow decreased eNOS and increased ACE, ET-1, and TGF-\u03b21 expression. ACE inhibition with ramiprilat, ET-1 receptor inhibition with bosentan, and treatment with the vasodilator bradykinin prevented flow-induced, EC-dependent SMC changes. In conclusion, high pulsatility flow stimulated SMC hypertrophy and contractile protein expression by altering EC production of vasoactive mediators and cytokines, supporting the idea of a coupling between proximal vascular stiffening, flow pulsatility, and downstream vascular function.", 
    "642": "Recent studies have shown that, in cirrhosis, portal angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] levels are increased and hepatic expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the Mas receptor are upregulated, but the effects of Ang-(1-7) on hepatic hemodynamics in cirrhosis have not been studied. This study investigated the effects of Ang-(1-7) on vasoconstrictor-induced perfusion pressure increases in cirrhotic rat livers. Ang II or the alpha 1 agonist methoxamine (MTX) were injected in the presence or absence of Ang-(1-7), and the perfusion pressure response was recorded. Denudation of vascular endothelial cells with sodium deoxycholate was used to investigate the contribution of endothelium to the effects of Ang-(1-7). Ang-(1-7) alone had no effect on perfusion pressure. However, it reduced the maximal vasoconstriction response and area under the pressure response curve to Ang II and MTX by >50% (P < 0.05). This effect of Ang-(1-7) was not blocked by Mas receptor inhibition with A779 or by Ang II type 1 and type 2 receptor and bradykinin B(2) receptor blockade and was not reproduced by the Mas receptor agonist AVE0991. D-Pro(7)-Ang-(1-7), a novel Ang-(1-7) receptor antagonist, completely abolished the vasodilatory effects of Ang-(1-7), as did inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl-ester, guanylate cyclase blockade with ODQ and endothelium denudation. The functional inhibition by D-Pro(7)-Ang-(1-7) was accompanied by significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation.

It is the principal component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that regulates blood pressure. Hence it is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. Here, we report the structures of an ACE homologue from Drosophila\u00a0melanogaster (AnCE; a proven structural model for the more complex human ACE) co-crystallized with mammalian peptide substrates (bradykinin, Thr(6) -bradykinin, angiotensin\u00a0I and a snake venom peptide inhibitor, bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b). The structures determined at 2-\u00c5 resolution illustrate that both angiotensin\u00a0II (the cleaved product of angiotensin\u00a0I by AnCE) and bradykinin-potentiating peptide-b bind in an analogous fashion at the active site of AnCE, but also exhibit significant differences. In addition, the binding of Arg-Pro-Pro, the cleavage product of bradykinin and Thr(6) - bradykinin, provides additional detail of the general peptide binding in AnCE.

    "665": "Specific features of the 24-h blood pressure (BP) pattern are linked to progressive injury of target tissues and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Several studies have consistently shown an association between blunted asleep BP decline and risk of fatal and nonfatal CVD events. Thus, there is growing focus on ways to properly control BP during nighttime sleep as well as during daytime activity. One strategy, termed chronotherapy, entails the timing of hypertension medications to endogenous circadian rhythm determinants of the 24-h BP pattern. Significant and clinically meaningful treatment-time differences in the beneficial and/or adverse effects of at least six different classes of hypertension medications, and their combinations, are now known. Generally, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are more effective with bedtime than morning dosing, and for dihydropyridine derivatives bedtime dosing significantly reduces risk of peripheral edema. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is highly circadian rhythmic and activates during nighttime sleep. Accordingly, evening/bedtime ingestion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) benazepril, captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, spirapril, trandolapril, and zofenopril exerts more marked effect on the asleep than awake systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) BP means. Likewise, the bedtime, in comparison with morning, ingestion schedule of the angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs irbesartan, olmesartan, telmisartan, and valsartan exerts greater therapeutic effect on asleep BP, plus significant increase in the sleep-time relative BP decline, with the additional benefit, independent of drug terminal half-life, of converting the 24-h BP profile into a more normal dipping pattern. This is the case also for the bedtime versus upon-awakening regimen of combination ARB-CCB, ACEI-CCB, and ARB-diuretic medications. The chronotherapy of conventional hypertension medications constitutes a new and cost-effective strategy for enhancing the control of daytime and nighttime SBP and DBP levels, normalizing the dipping status of their 24-h patterning, and potentially reducing the risk of CVD events and end-organ injury, for example, of the blood vessels and tissues of the heart, brain, kidney, and retina.",

A variety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies have been employed to prevent AF after CABG. Preoperative and postoperative beta blockers are recommended in all cardiac surgery patients as the first-line medication to prevent POAF. Sotalol and amiodarone are also effective and can be regarded as appropriate alternatives in high-risk patients. Corticosteroids and biatrial pacing may be considered in selected CABG patients but are associated with risk. Magnesium supplementation should be considered in patients with hypomagnesemia.

NWT-03 and VIL both reduced renal interleukin (Il)-1\u03b2/Il-13 mRNA expression and glomerulosclerosis. However, only NWT-03 additionally decreased renal tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 mRNA and P22(phox) protein expression, reduced albuminuria, and restored aortic EDR. Indomethacin added to the organ bath instantly improved aortic EDR, indicating a role for cyclooxygenase (COX)-derived contractile prostanoids in opposing relaxation in ZDF rats.

The R+T combination lowered clinic BP somewhat more with no further cardiovascular or renal protection. The aim of this substudy was to see whether these clinic BP changes reflected the changes of 24-hour BP, a BP with a better prognostic value. In 422 patients in whom 24-hour BP monitoring was performed either before or after 6 to 24 months of treatment, demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the 3 treated groups. Twenty-four-hour systolic BP was similarly reduced by R (-2.0 mm Hg) and T (-2.1 mm Hg), whereas the reduction was more than twice as large in the T+R group (-5.3 mm Hg), which showed a lower on-treatment 24-hour BP also in additional patients (n=408) in whom ambulatory BP was performed only on-treatment. Twenty-four-hour systolic BP was \u2248 14 mm Hg lower than clinic systolic BP at baseline, whereas during treatment the 2 values became progressively closer as clinic systolic BP was more tightly controlled and superimposable when clinic systolic BP was <120 mm Hg. Similar results were obtained for diastolic BP. These findings provide evidence on the relationship of clinic and ambulatory BP target drug treatment. They also show that in the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial, failure of the R+T combination to enhance cardiovascular and renal protection was not because of inability to more effectively control daily life BP.", 
    "678": "Mineralocorticoid-receptor antagonists (MRAs) reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in patients treated with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II-receptor blockers. The use of MRAs, however, is limited by the occurrence of hyperkalaemia, which frequently occurs in patients older than 65 years with impaired kidney function, and/or diabetes. Patients with these characteristics might still benefit from MRA therapy, however, and should not be excluded from this treatment option. This limitation raises the question of how to optimize the therapeutic use of MRAs in this population of patients. Understanding the individual variability in patients' responses to MRAs, in terms of albuminuria, blood pressure and serum potassium levels, might lead to targeted intervention. MRA use might be restricted to patients with high levels of mineralocorticoid activity, evaluated by circulating renin and aldosterone levels or renal excretion of potassium. In addition, reviewing the patient's diet and concomitant medications might prove useful in reducing the risk of developing subsequent hyperkalaemia. If hyperkalaemia does develop, treatment options exist to decrease potassium levels, including administration of calcium gluconate, insulin, \u03b2(2)-agonists, diuretics and cation-exchange resins. In combination with novel aldosterone blockers, these strategies might offer a rationale with which to optimize therapeutic intervention and extend the population of patients who can benefit from use of MRAs.", 
    "679": "Intracranial aneurysms (IA) are a relatively frequent vascular abnormality. The prevailing opinion is that cerebral aneurysmal disease is related to hemodynamic and genetic factors, associated with structural weakness in the arterial wall which was acquired by a specific, often unknown, event. Possibly the trigger moment of aneurysm formation may depend on the dynamic arterial growth, which is closely related to aging/atherosclerosis. In most individuals, an endovascular/microsurgical approach is possible in order to obliterate the IA. However, in a number of patients with an unruptured IA (UIA), the neurosurgeon's decision is to just \"sit back, observe, and wait\", based on the favorable natural history of some of the UIAs. Furthermore, some individuals need to be kept under close observation since they have a higher chance of developing IA, especially those with at least two affected first-degree relatives with an IA, subjects with polycystic kidney disease, and patients who have undergone an aneurysm intervention. In these examples prophylactic strategies should be adopted, if it is at all possible. The main question is deciding the best option of clinical treatment for these cases, when surgical approach is contraindicated, or for those subjects who are more prone to develop an IA. In the present article, we hypothetically suggest a pharmacologic form of treatment with statins, beta-adrenergic blocker agents, and/or angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blockers to inhibit or slow down IA formation, taking into consideration some pathophysiological aspects related to aneurysmal development, such as: hemodynamic stress, arterial wall inflammation, nitric oxide formation, and atheromatous disease.",

The regression of cardiovascular hypertrophy is currently considered an important therapeutic target in reducing the omplications of hypertension. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy by probiotic-fermented purple sweet potato yogurt (PSPY) with high \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content in spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) hearts. Six-week-old male SHRs were separated randomly and equally into 4 experimental groups: sterile water, captopril and 2 PSPY groups with different doses (10 and 100%) for 8 weeks. The changes in myocardial architecture and key molecules of the hypertrophy-related pathway in the excised left ventricle from these rats were determined by histopathological analysis, hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blot analysis. Abnormal myocardial architecture and enlarged interstitial spaces observed in the SHRs were significantly decreased in the captopril and PSPY groups compared with the sterile water group. Moreover, the increases in atrial natriuretic peptide, B-type natriuretic peptide, phosphorilated protein kinase C\u03b1 and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II levels in the left ventricle were accompanied by hypertension and increases in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 activities with enhanced cardiac hypertrophy. However, the protein levels of the hypertrophic-related pathways were completely reversed by the administration of PSPY. PSPY may repress the activation of ANP and BNP which subsequently inhibit the dephosphorylation of the nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 3 and ultimately prevent the progression of cardiac hypertrophy.",

Tools to control hyperglycemia have improved and it was shown that improvement in glycemic control diminished the risk of late diabetic complications, including nephropathy. Moreover, in patients with impaired renal function, aggressive treatment of hypertension and renoprotective blockade of the renin-angiotensin system were shown to postpone end-stage renal disease (ESRD), albeit for a short while. Despite these achievements, the incidence of ESRD caused by T1D in the US population has not decreased but rather has increased over the past 20 years, although it now occurs at slightly older ages. This state of affairs is a call to action. This should begin with adopting a new model of diabetic nephropathy in human beings. In that model, instead of microalbuminuria or proteinuria, the focus should be on diagnosis and treatment of progressive renal function decline that leads to ESRD. Such a model has received significant support in clinical and epidemiologic studies. Investigation of mechanisms of such progressive renal function decline should help in the identification of new therapeutic targets and the development of new interventions. To evaluate these interventions, accurate diagnostic algorithms are needed so T1D patients will be stratified according to time to onset to ESRD. Consistent with concepts of personalized medicine, the new interventions should be tailored to and evaluated in patients predicted to have rapid, moderate, or even slow progression to ESRD.",

Given the high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease, it is important to identify and treat related risk factors. However, there is growing uncertainty about the benefits of some recommended treatment targets. The National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recommend an A1C level of less than 7 percent in patients with diabetes mellitus, although there is no evidence that treatment to this goal reduces cardiovascular events or progression to end-stage renal disease. Optimal blood pressure goals are controversial, and further study is needed to determine these goals in relation to amount of proteinuria. Concurrent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers leads to worsening kidney function and is not recommended. Lipid-lowering therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, but not progression of chronic kidney disease. The treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, particularly the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and optimal hemoglobin goals, is also controversial. Studies have shown increased morbidity and mortality with use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents aimed at normalizing hemoglobin levels. Patients with chronic kidney disease are at high risk of morbidity and mortality from the use of intravenous contrast agents. Isotonic intravenous hydration with sodium bicarbonate or saline has been shown to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy. Gadolinium-based contrast agents should be avoided if the glomerular filtration rate is less than 30 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 because of the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.",

This study also aimed to explore the role of PPAR-\u03b3 in lisinopril and telmisartan mediated effects in i.c.v. STZ mice. Donepezil served as the positive control in the study. Mice underwent i.c.v. injection of STZ. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was employed for assessment of learning and memory. Various biochemical estimations, namely brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, nitrite/nitrate and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) levels and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, were also performed. The study showed that i.c.v. STZ significantly impaired learning and memory of the animals along with a significant enhancement in brain AChE, MPO, TBARS, nitrite/nitrate levels and reduction in brain GSH levels. Treatments of lisinopril/telmisartan/donepezil significantly attenuated STZ induced behavioral and biochemical changes. Pre-treatment with bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether (BADGE), a selective PPAR-\u03b3 antagonist, significantly abolished the beneficial effect of lisinopril/telmisartan in i.c.v. STZ treated animals.

Vasopeptidase inhibitors block angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity. We propose that increased activity of ACE and NEP contributes to pathophysiology of DIO. To address this issue C57Bl/6J mice or mice deficient in NEP were fed a high-fat diet and treated with ilepatril, enalapril, ACE inhibitor, or candoxatril, NEP inhibitor, using both prevention and intervention protocols. Endpoints included glucose utilization and neural function determination. In the prevention study glucose tolerance was impaired in DIO C57Bl/6J mice and improved with ilepatril or enalapril. Sensory nerve conduction velocity, thermal nociception, and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were impaired in DIO C57Bl/6J mice and improved with ilepatril or candoxatril. In the intervention study only enalapril improved glucose tolerance. Sensory nerve conduction velocity and intraepidermal nerve fiber density were improved by all three treatments, whereas thermal nociception was improved by ilepatril or candoxatril. In NEP-deficient mice DIO impaired glucose utilization and this was improved with enalapril. Nerve function was not impaired by DIO in NEP-deficient mice.

Seven hundred and one AD patients with at least 3 different cognitive evaluations and genotypic information for APOE and 6 genome wide association study-significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms were selected for this study. Mean differences in Global Deterioration Score and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) were evaluated using nonparametric tests, general linear model and mixed models for repeated measurements. Each chart was also reviewed for evidence of treatment with any cholinesterase inhibitor, memantine, or both. Relationships between therapeutic protocols, genetic markers, and progression were explored using stratified analysis looking for specific effects on progression in each therapeutic category separately. Neither calculation rendered a Bonferroni-corrected statistically significant difference in any genetic marker. Mixed model results suggested differences in the average point in MMSE test for patients carrying PICALM GA or AA genotype compared with GG carriers at the end of the follow-up (MMSE mean difference = -0.57; 95% confidence interval, -1.145 to 0.009; p = 0.047).

    "745": "We have documented recently that bradykinin (BK) directly inhibits activity of the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) via the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R)-G(q/11)-phospholipase C pathway. In this study, we took advantage of mice genetically engineered to lack bradykinin receptors (B1R, B2R(-/-)) to probe a physiological role of BK cascade in regulation of ENaC in native tissue, aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron. Under normal sodium intake (0.32% Na(+)), ENaC open probability (P(o)) was modestly elevated in B1R, B2R(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. This difference is augmented during elevated Na(+) intake (2.00% Na(+)) and negated during Na(+) restriction (<0.01% Na(+)). Saturation of systemic mineralocorticoid status with deoxycorticosterone acetate similarly increased ENaC activity in both mouse strains, suggesting that the effect of BK on ENaC is independent of aldosterone. It is accepted that angiotensin-converting enzyme represents the major pathway of BK degradation. Systemic inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme with captopril (30 mg/kg of body weight for 7 days) significantly decreases ENaC activity and P(o) in wild-type mice, but this effect is diminished in B1R, B2R(-/-) mice. At the cellular level, acute captopril (100 \u03bcmol/L) treatment sensitized BK signaling cascade and greatly potentiated the inhibitory effect of 100 nmol/L of BK on ENaC. We concluded that BK cascade has its own specific role in blunting ENaC activity, particularly under conditions of elevated sodium intake. Augmentation of BK signaling in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron inhibits ENaC-mediated Na(+) reabsorption, contributing to the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.",

Therapeutic inhibition ofTLPs is believed to be a novel strategy inthe development of a new generation antibiotics.In the present study inhibition of TLN and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) by small peptides were studied by in vitro binding assays and theoretical calculations. The capacity of the peptides to inhibitTLN induced cleavage ofthe transcription factor nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-\u03baB) was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs).Nine peptides inhibited ACE with IC50 values in the range 0.48 (IVY) to 1408 (HF) \u03bcM, while seven inhibited TLN with IC50 values in the range 0.00034 (IY) to 95640 (FW) \u03bcM. Calculations indicated that the peptides occupied the S1' and S2' subsites of ACE, and that IY, LW and IW occupiedthe S1' and S2' subsites, while FW, WL and WV occupiedthe S1 and S1' subsites of TLN. EMSA showed that peptides inhibited TLN induced cleavage of NF-\u03baB.

Individualizing therapy of ACE inhibitors with clinical risk factors in low-risk patients with stable coronary artery disease is not feasible. The concept of pharmacogenetics, by studying patient factors more individually, offers a first glimpse in the quest for the 'holy grail' of personalized medicine. As such, genetic targets in the direct pharmacodynamic pathway of ACE inhibitors, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, is a plausible candidate for such an approach. In the past few decades, results of pharmacogenetic studies were scarce and inconsistent. However, recently the first reports of larger pharmacogenetic studies are now confirming that the 'pharmacogenetic approach' might be feasible in the future. The current review focuses on the recent developments in pharmacogenetic research in response to ACE inhibitors in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

Zofenopril proved to be very effective in patients with coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, thanks to its unique effective mechanism of action for improving blood pressure control, left ventricular function and myocardial ischemia burden, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. The SMILE project involved more than 3500 patients with coronary artery disease and demonstrated that zofenopril treatment may reduce mortality and morbidity in patients with myocardial infarction, also when combined with acetyl salicylic acid and to a greater extent than lisinopril and ramipril. In addition, the results of the SMILE-ISCHEMIA study have demonstrated an interesting anti-ischemic effect of zofenopril, and these properties largely contribute to the overall clinical benefit of the drug. The effects of zofenopril on blood pressure control and cardiovascular protection clearly support its primary role for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

Targets included in the analysis covered all signaling pathways thought to be implicated in the therapeutic actions of all CVD drugs approved by US FDA. A total of 39 putative targets were identified. Three of these targets, calcineurin (CN), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were experimentally validated at a molecular level. Protective effects of AGS-IV were also compared with the CN inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) in cultured cardiomyocytes exposed to adriamycin. Network analysis of protein-protein interactions (PPI) was carried out with reference to the therapeutic profiles of approved CVD drugs.

Thus, we investigated the relationship between diastolic dysfunction, UACR, and diabetes mellitus (DM) in the EDEN study. We investigated the effect of switching from an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to a combination of losartan and hydrochlorothiazide on left ventricular (LV) relaxation in patients with hypertension and diastolic dysfunction. We enrolled 106 patients with and 265 patients without DM. All patients had diastolic dysfunction and had not achieved their treatment goals with an ACEi or ARB. The measurements of e' velocity and E/e' ratio was performed with echocardiography as markers of LV diastolic function. We switched the ACEi or ARB to losartan/hydrochlorothiazide and followed these patients for 24 weeks. UACR was decreased in patients with DM (123.4 \u00b1 288.4 to 66.5 \u00b1 169.2 mg/g creatinine; P = 0.0024), but not in patients without DM (51.2 \u00b1 181.8 to 39.2 \u00b1 247.9 mg/g creatinine; P = 0.1051). Among DM patients, there was a significant relationship between changes in UACR and changes in e' velocity (r = -0.144; P = 0.0257) and between changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate and changes in the E/e' ratio (r = -0.130; P = 0.0436). Among patients without DM, there was a significant relationship between changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and changes in E/e' (r = 0.205; P = 0.0010). Multivariate analysis demonstrated changes in hemoglobin A(1c) levels as one of the determinants of change of e' and E/e' in patients with DM, whereas hs-CRP was the determinant of change of e' among patients without DM. These data suggest that improvement in LV diastolic function is associated with an improvement of DM and a concomitant reduction in UACR among DM patients, and with a reduction of hs-CRP in patients without DM when thiazide is added to a renin-angiotensin blocker treatment regimen.",

Retrospective analysis of previously published drug trials revealed marked sex differences in efficacy and adverse effects in a number of cardiovascular drugs. This includes a higher mortality among women taking digoxin for heart failure, more torsade de pointes arrhythmia in QT prolonging drugs and more cough with ACE inhibitors. Trends towards a greater benefit for women and/or female animals have been observed in some studies for endothelin receptor antagonists, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the ACE-inhibitor ramipril and the aldosterone antagonist eplerenone. However, reproduction of these results in independent studies and solid statistical evidence is still lacking. Some drugs require a particularly careful dose adaptation in women: the beta-blocker metoprolol, the calcium channel blocker verapamil, loop-, and thiazide diuretics. In conclusion, sex differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics have to be taken into account for cardiovascular drug therapy in women.",

These properties could improve patient and graft long-term survival rates in select transplant recipients. In addition, monotherapy always diminishes the rate of non-compliance in chronic patients. We examined the evolution of 47 low immunological risk kidney transplant recipients with mTOR inhibitor monotherapy. The mean age was 45 \u00b1 10 years (range: 18-69 years), with 25 males y 22 females. We performed an immunological evaluation before and at 3 and 12 months after starting monotherapy by detection of donor-specific antibodies by microsphere cytometry and the determination of lymphocyte activity with production of ATP by CD4+ T-lymphocytes activated by PHA mitogen. We considered patients to be of low immunological risk when the patient had an ATP production less than 520 ng/dl and no history of acute rejection episode or donor-specific antibodies. Initially, 5 patients received immunosuppression induction without calcineurin inhibitors (mycophenolate, prednisone, mTOR inhibitors and anti-CD25), and 42 were converted to mTOR inhibitors due to secondary effects of calcineurin inhibitors or malignancies. A total of 34 recipients had received sirolimus and 13 everolimus. Eighteen out 47 patients (38.2%) received prednisone and 29 (61.7%) mycophenolate with mTor before starting monotherapy. The mean follow-up period after starting monotherapy was 46.9 months (95% CI: 38.8-55.0 months). At the end of the follow-up, 7 out of 47 recipients (11.5%) had to change immunosuppression without losing their grafts after 1 year, due to heavy proteinuria in 2 cases, pulmonary infection in 1, acute rejection in 1, hepatotoxicity in 1, vasculitis in 1 and a temporary inclusion on dialysis after acute pyelonephritis in 1. Four out of 47 patients (8.5%) lost their grafts, as a result of chronic rejection in 3 cases, and as a result of death with a functioning graft in 1. The rate of acute rejection was 2.1%, one episode, which was solved with steroid pulses and switching from mTOR inhibitors to tacrolimus and mycophenolate. No patients developed donor-specific antibodies, and all of them maintained an ATP production less than 520 ng/dl. The rates of graft and recipient survival were both 100% at 1 year, and 88.7% and 95.7% at 5 years. The percentages of patients on monotherapy were 97.9% and 70.5 % at 1 and 5 years, respectively. At the end of the follow-up, 36 out of 47 recipients remained on mTOR inhibitor monotherapy. Serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rates improved significantly, from 2.16 \u00b1 1.05 mg/dl to 1.49 \u00b1 0.56 mg/dl (P=.001) and from 39.23 \u00b1 25.23 ml/min to 52.23 \u00b1 23.20 ml/min (P=.001), respectively. Proteinuria increased but not significantly, from 306.6 \u00b1 400 mg/24h to 418.1 \u00b1 514.1mg/24h (P=.17). The patients treated with mTOR inhibitors received significantly more erythropoietin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers than before starting mTOR, but there was no change in the treatment with statins or hypotensive agents. Body weight and the percentage of diabetic recipients were similar during the study. No cases of non-compliance were observed during the follow-up.

We aimed to clarify the longitudinal effect of VVV of BP on deterioration of renal function in patients with non-diabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD). We retrospectively studied 56 patients with non-diabetic CKD (stage 3 or 4) who visited our nephrology clinic between September 1994 and May 2011. VVV of BP was defined as the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (CV) of office BP measured at 12 consecutive visits. Main outcomes were the annual decline in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the composite renal end point defined as a doubling of serum creatinine or the need for dialysis. The median observation period was 83 months. Standard deviation and CV of office systolic BP (SBP) were significantly associated with the slope of the eGFR after adjustments for confounders. The adjusted risk for composite renal end points more than doubled for each increment of 1-standard deviation of the standard deviation of office SBP (hazard ratio (HR) 2.20, P=0.001), and for each increment of 1-standard deviation of the CV of office SBP (HR 2.12, P=0.002).

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 plays an important role in tissue remodelling during peritoneal injury caused by peritoneal dialysis (PD), but MMP-2 inhibitors have not yet been used clinically. Recently, it was reported that captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), can inhibit MMP-2. 2. To investigate the potential usefulness of ACEI during PD, the molecular interaction between the MMP-2 active site and the active form of temocapril (temocaprilat) was investigated using molecular modelling. Furthermore, the effects of temocapril on MMP-2 activity in peritoneal effluents and the peritoneal solute transport rate of PD patients were determined. 3. Temocaprilat bound to the MMP-2 active centre and recognized two hydrophobic substrate-binding sites in the MMP-2 molecular model. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in peritoneal effluents was directly inhibited by temocaprilat (IC(50) 0.47 \u03bcmol/L). In one patient given temocapril, the peritoneal solute transport rate decreased gradually during PD. 4. Temocapril may prove to be an important candidate for development as a novel therapeutic agent for MMP-2 inhibition to prevent peritoneal injury caused by PD.",

We have previously shown that brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors can reduce the incidence of Alzheimer diseases (AD) in elderly hypertensive patients and that hypertension treatment with brain penetrating ACE inhibitors slowed the rate of cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients with hypertension. We speculate that the favorable effects might be due to the direct effects of brain-penetrating ACE inhibitors on RAS in the brain, since no significant differences were found in the levels of blood pressure among the groups treated with several antihypertensive drugs. Brain penetrating ACE inhibitors might have benefits not only for the prevention but also for the treatment of mild to moderate AD with hypertension.",

All of them introduce new onset diabetes mellitus and various kinds of diabetic complications. RAAS suppression by using not only ACE inhibitor, Ang II receptor blockade (ARB) but also aldosterone receptor blockade improved insulin secretion and IR.

    "805": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in pathophysiology of kidney and cardiovascular disease, and their interactions. Clinical studies have demonstrated that RAAS inhibition reduces cardiovascular and renal events, particularly in patients with renal dysfunction. It may be assumed that impairment of renal function induces various injurious substances such as inflammation and oxidative molecules, which may activate RAAS, and RAAS, in turn, enhances inflammations and oxidative stress. Studies have shown that indices of renal protection, such as reductions of albuminuria, are closely associated with cardiovascular protection. In addition, decrements of renal function are also associated with worse prognosis. Inhibitors of RAAS decrease urinary albumin excretion but also reduce GFR. From the clinical point of view, the most appropriate antihypertensive regime would be the one that reduces albuminuria but maintain GFR.",

Of note, CASE-J trial demonstrated that a systemic blockade of RAS significantly reduced the incidence of newly occurring type 2 diabetes, notably in obese patients with hypertension.

Most of the deleterious actions of the RAAS on insulin signals appear to be mediated through activation of the serine/threonine kinase, oxidative stress and tissue-inflammation in insulin-sensitive organs. Both experimental and clinical studies demonstrated that angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone could play a role in the development of insulin resistance, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Large randomized clinical trials revealed that blockade of the RAAS with either angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors or AT1 receptor blockers results in decreased T2DM incidence, with a minor attenuation of markers for insulin resistance. This review focuses on the role of RAAS in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, as well as on clinical relevance of RAAS blockade in the prevention and treatment of the metabolic syndrome and pre-diabetes.",

The authors reported that angiotensin II significantly increased TRAP-positive multinuclear osteoclasts with the up-regulation of RANKL expression through extracellular kinase of osteoblast. These effects were abolished with co-treatment of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARB). Recently, RANK-RANKL-OPG system is proved to be involved in vascular calcification and RAAS also might be involved in the development of the disease.

However, the role of central angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in memory function is still unclear. The present study investigated the involvement of central ACE in colchicine-induced memory impairment in the context of cholinergic function and oxidative stress. Memory impairment was induced by intracerebral colchicine administration in mice. The ACE inhibitor, perindopril (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg/day), was administered orally for 14 days. Memory function was evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test from the 14(th) day on after colchicine injection. Donepezil was used as a standard. Parameters of oxidative stress and cholinergic function, ACE activity in serum and the brain were estimated after the completion of behavioral studies. Colchicine caused memory impairment as revealed by no significant change in latency to reach a hidden platform in the MWM test. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in MDA, ROS, and nitrite levels with a reduction in GSH level and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in the brain of colchicine-treated mice. Colchicine significantly increased brain ACE activity without affecting serum ACE. Donepezil prevented colchicine-induced memory impairment in mice. The antidementic effect of perindopril may be attributed to reduced oxidative stress and improvement in cholinergic function. Moreover, the elevated brain ACE activity was also inhibited by perindopril. The study showed that central ACE plays an important role in colchicine-induced memory deficit, corroborating a number of studies that show that treatment with ACE inhibitors could be neuroprotective.",

ACE-like activity was detected, as well as an Ang II receptor with low affinity for AT(1) and AT(2) selective receptor antagonists (pK(B) values of 5.62\u00b10.23 and 5.08\u00b10.25). A disulfide reducing agent almost abolished the Ang II effect, while an alpha adrenoceptor antagonist, or removing the endothelium, did not modify the Ang II effect. These results indicate that the B. jararaca aorta has an Ang II receptor pharmacologically distinct from AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, and the vasoconstrictor effect observed is independent of catecholamine or endothelium modulation.

The following variables were measured: blood flow rate, peripheral vascular resistance indices at the extra- and intracranial levels, metabolic indices of cerebrovascular responsiveness, and coefficient of variability as an indicator of the cerebrovascular reserve capacity under conditions of antihypertensive treatment. Three antihypertensive therapeutic regimens were employed, viz. lisinopril plus indapamide, bisoprolol plus indapamide, and amlodipine plus indapamide. It was shown that all the three regimen resulted in positive changes in the parameters of blood flow and peripheral vascular resistance. At the same time, the use of amlodipine plus indapamide ensured a more gradual reduction of peripheral vascular resistance and the most pronounced increase of cerebrovascular reserve capacity compared with the two remaining regimens.

Here, we studied two common sequelae of endothelial dysfunction in diabetes: glomerular capillary growth and effects on neighboring podocytes. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes increased glomerular capillary volume in both C57BL/6 and eNOS(-/-) mice. Inhibiting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor attenuated albuminuria in diabetic C57BL/6 mice but not in diabetic eNOS(-/-) mice, even though it inhibited glomerular capillary enlargement in both. In eNOS(-/-) mice, an acute podocytopathy and heavy albuminuria occurred as early as 2 weeks after inducing diabetes, but treatment with either captopril or losartan prevented these effects. In vitro, serum derived from diabetic eNOS(-/-) mice augmented actin filament rearrangement in cultured podocytes. Furthermore, conditioned medium derived from eNOS(-/-) glomerular endothelial cells exposed to both high glucose and angiotensin II activated podocyte RhoA. Taken together, these results suggest that the combined effects of eNOS deficiency and hyperglycemia contribute to podocyte injury, highlighting the importance of communication between endothelial cells and podocytes in diabetes. Identifying mediators of this communication may lead to the future development of therapies targeting endothelial dysfunction in albuminuric individuals with diabetes.",

The renin inhibitor, aliskiren, by suppressing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) proximally, may limit breakthrough compared to conventional RAAS blockade. This open-label study (NCT01129557) randomized subjects to aliskiren 300 mg daily (A), valsartan 320 mg daily (V), or aliskiren 150 mg + valsartan 160 mg daily (A+V) for 9 months. Eligible subjects had proteinuria >300 mg/day, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >45 mL/min/1.73 m(2), and systolic blood pressure (BP) >130 or diastolic BP >80 mm Hg. Serum and 24-hour urine aldosterone (indexed to 24-hour urine Na) were checked before initiation of therapy and at 3, 6, and 9 months. Aldosterone breakthrough was defined as a sustained increase from baseline aldosterone by study end. The study was intended to enroll 120 subjects but was terminated early by the sponsor. We present here the results of 33 subjects who completed the protocol, of which 12 were randomized to A, 11 were randomized to V, and 10 were randomized to A+V.

Five weeks-old SHR and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with captopril at 30 mg/kg/day, in drinking water for 2 or 14 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured, and isolated kidneys were tested for perfusion pressure and AT1R expression; while Ang II and Ang-(1-7) concentrations were determined in plasma. Captopril did not modify SBP in WKY rats and avoided its increase as SHR aged. Plasma Ang-II concentration was \u223c4-5 folds higher in SHR rats, and captopril reduced it (P<0.05); while captopril increased Ang-(1-7) by \u223c2 fold in all rat groups. Captopril increased Ang II-induced pressor response in kidneys of WKY and SHR rats, phenomenon not observed in kidneys stimulated with phenylephrine, a \u03b1\u2081-adrenoceptor agonist. Captopril did not modify AT1R in kidney cortex and medulla among rat strains and ages. Data indicate that captopril increased Ang II-induced kidney perfusion pressure but not AT\u2081R density in kidney of WKY and SHR rats, due to blockade of angiotensin II synthesis; however, ACE inhibitors may have other actions like activating signaling processes that could contribute to their diverse effects.",

Duck skin byproducts were hydrolyzed using nine proteases (Alcalase, Collagenase, Flavourzyme, Neutrase, papain, pepsin, Protamex, trypsin, and \u03b1-chymotrypsin) to produce an antihypertensive peptide. Of the various hydrolysates produced, the \u03b1-chymotrypsin hydrolysate exhibited the highest ACE inhibitory activity. The hydrolysate was purified using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The amino acid sequence of the ACE inhibitory peptide was identified as a hexapeptide Trp-Tyr-Pro-Ala-Ala-Pro, with a molecular weight of 693.90 Da. The peptide had an IC50 value of 137 \u03bcM, and the inhibitory pattern of the purified ACE inhibitor from duck skin byproducts was determined to be competitive by Lineweaver-Burk plots. In addition, the peptide was synthesized and the ACE inhibitory activity was verified in vivo.

Several observational studies have suggested the use of a dual blockade of the RAS to benefit from a better cardiorenal protection. However, recent randomized controlled studies failed to demonstrate that a dual blockade exert a better protection than single blockade, but showed a higher risk for renal complications and hyperkalemia. To decrease the residual risk, other opportunities may be recommended such as reinforcement of low salt diet, use of supraphysiological dose of a monotherapy inhibiting the RAS (perhaps prescribed at the evening) or addition of an aldosterone antagonist. However, all these approaches, as dual therapy, may also increase the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency and thus require to be used under strict medical supervision.",

    "895": "Adverse remodeling involves a complicated process of structural and functional changes in the left ventricle (LV). LV remodeling is progressive and, if left unchecked, culminates in heart failure that portends a poor prognosis. Clinical trials in heart failure have employed various techniques to assess ventricular remodeling while focusing on therapeutic-specific strategies to halt or reverse remodeling. These strategies include (1) those designed to reduce wall stress by limiting LV dilatation and reducing LV loading conditions (nitrates and epicardial restraint), (2) those designed to block neurohormonal activation, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor blockers, and aldosterone receptor blockers, (3) ionotropic agents/cardiac glycosides, and (4) cardiac resynchronization therapy. Strategies in development include mechanical assist devices and myocardial regeneration. To date, trials have demonstrated a linkage between indices of remodeling and clinical outcomes measures. Indices of remodeling have facilitated identification of targets for novel pharmaceutical agents and new device therapies.",

In the combined studies the overall relative risk of ACEI-treated patients versus controls was 0.61 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.51-0.75; P < 0.001). Among Asian patients, the relative risk was 0.42 (95% CI 0.32-0.56; P < 0.001).

    "900": "A little is known about the behavior of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in glomerulo-nephritis (GN), although it is activated in other models of injury. To study renal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) gene expression in patients with GN to determine its role in the disease process and other factors that may influence the course of the disease and the prognosis, e.g. treatment with ACE inhibitor (ACEI) drugs, we studied 20 patients with GN allocated to two groups: ten patients received an ACEI drug and ten patients did not receive ACEI in addition to a control group of ten healthy subjects. Routine and special laboratory investigation, histopathological studies and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis for renal ACE mRNA were done for both the study and the control groups. There was a statistically significant increase in ACE mRNA gene expression in the GN groups than in control group, but no statistically significant difference in ACE mRNA gene expression between the patients group that received and the group that did not receive ACEI. A significant correlation was found between the ACE mRNA gene expression and the mean blood pressure, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and 24-h urinary protein. In conclusion, a higher level of ACE mRNA gene expression in patients suffering from GN may suggest a role of the RAS in the process of GN, perhaps contributing to glomerular hypertrophy and matrix overproduction. The use of ACEI drugs possibly slows the rate of progression of renal failure and plays a role in controlling the pathophysiology.",

Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is identified as a main therapeutic target in controlling high blood pressure. The present study investigated the ACE inhibitory property of a flavonoid-rich apple peel extract (FAE), its constituents, selected flavonoids and some quercetin metabolites using a biochemical assay of ACE inhibition and a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) model. FAE, all the tested flavonoids except genistein, and two quercetin metabolites (quercetin-3-O-glucuronic acid and quercetin-3-O-sulfate) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited ACE. Enzyme kinetic analysis revealed that flavonoids are competitive inhibitors of ACE. In the HUVEC model, FAE, quercetin-3-O-glucoside and quercetin-3-O-glucuronic acid inhibited significantly (p<0.05) ACE activity. Overall, FAE and most of the flavonoids tested showed ACE inhibition in vitro which needs further investigations using animal and human clinical trials.",

The racial/ethnic difference persisted after adjustment for age, gender, income, drug coverage, location, and health status. Patterns of adherence to statins and angiotensin-converting enzymes/angiotensin II receptor blockers were similar. Among beneficiaries with close-to-full drug coverage, minorities were still less likely to adhere relative to whites: odds ratio 0.70 (95% CI 0.65-0.75) for blacks and odds ratio 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.90) for Native Americans.",

Seven isolates were screened for their ability to produce peptides and free isoflavones in soy milk. The antihypertensive, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties of the resulting fermented soy milks were evaluated in vitro using biochemical assays. Isolates 1-5 were found to be producers of fermented soy milk with angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitory activity (ACEI). Isolate 3 was found to be a producer of free isoflavones that increased the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of fermented soy milk. LAB isolates 2-5 were submitted to genetic profiling and a characterization scheme. These isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium , and none of them contained virulence determinants or resistance to antibiotics.

However, this treatment is not widely used for renal allograft recipients mainly because of the potential side effects, including a decrease in renal function as well as onset of hyperkalemia or anemia. Herein we investigated the effects of ACEI introduction to hypertensive renal transplantation patients who did not display renal artery stenosis. At least 2 months after transplantation, we exchanged amlodipine (5 mg) for either ramipril or perindopril (5 mg) in 25 patients who were free of renal artery stenosis as determined indirectly by measuring the renal arterial resistance index with the noninvasive, inexpensive Doppler ultrasound method. The resistance index was evaluated again at 2 weeks. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, calculated creatinine clearance, serum potassium, hemoglobin and hematocrit were also measured before as well as at 2, 4, and 12 weeks after conversion to ACEI. The conversion did not change the mean renal arterial resistance index, nor did it influence renal function or blood count, and it was equally effective for controlling blood pressure. The serum potassium level increased at 2 and 4 weeks; however, it was within the normal range in all patients. Our data suggested that measurement of the renal arterial resistance index is a noninvasive, inexpensive, and reliable preselection method before introduction of ACEI in renal allograft recipients.",

We studied the status of ACEI/ARB prescriptions and serum creatinine (Scr) and potassium monitoring in CKD patients. A retrospective observational study was conducted on patients who had at least two sets of Scr data at outpatient visit. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the second Scr value was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease four-variable equation. CKD was defined and staged according to the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Guideline. Patients with diabetes and/or hypertension with an eGFR over 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and without proteinuria were defined as the CKD-at-risk group. The percentages and factors associated with ACEI/ARB prescription and Scr and potassium monitoring were calculated and analyzed by logistic regression. Among the 5714 subjects included, ACEIs/ARBs were prescribed to over 50% of patients in the CKD-at-risk group and in CKD stages 1-5. After adjusting for age, sex, potassium level, eGFR, and co-morbidities, the odds ratios for prescriptions of ACEIs/ARBs were 1.66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.44-1.91, p < 0.001) and 2.80 (95% CI 2.12-3.70, p < 0.001) in CKD stage 3, and stages 4 and 5, respectively, compared with the reference group (eGFR\u226560 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). During the year of ACEI/ARB treatment, Scr was monitored in 91.6% of ACEI/ARB-treated patients, while potassium was monitored in only 38.1%. Renal function status was the independent factor for monitoring of Scr and potassium. In conclusion, prescription of ACEIs/ARBs was common in all stages of CKD. Most patients underwent Scr monitoring, but potassium monitoring was less frequent, and this should be improved in clinical practice.",

Patients with aneurysm diameters below or equal to 55 mm (termed 'small AAAs') are managed with aneurysm surveillance as there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend surgery in these cases. As more patients are screened, there will be an increasing number of small AAAs identified. There is interest in pharmaceutical interventions (for example angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antibiotics, beta-blockers, statins) which could be given to such patients to delay or reverse aneurysm expansion and reduce the need for elective surgical repair.",

    "929": "Seven trials involving 1558 participants were included in this review; 457 were involved in four trials of antibiotic medication, and 1101 were involved in three trials of beta-blocker medication. Five of the studies were rated at a high risk of bias.Individually, all of the included trials reported non-significant differences in AAA expansion rates between their intervention and control groups.The two major drug groups were then analysed separately. For AAA expansion it was only possible to combine two of the antibiotic trials in a meta-analysis. This demonstrated that roxithromycin had a small but significant protective effect (MD -0.86 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.57 to -0.14). When referral to AAA surgery was compared (including all four antibiotic trials in the meta-analysis), non-significantly fewer patients were referred in the intervention groups (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.57) than the control groups. When only the trials reporting actual elective surgery were included in a subgroup analysis, the result remained statistically non-significant (OR 1.17; 95% CI 0.57 to 2.42).For the beta-blocker trials, when all were combined in a meta-analysis, there was a very small, non-significant protective effect for propranolol on AAA expansion (MD -0.08 mm; 95% CI -0.25 to 0.10), and non-significantly fewer patients were referred to AAA surgery in the propranolol group (OR 0.74; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05). Bronchospasm and shortness of breath were the main adverse effects from the beta-blockers. In one trial the adverse effects were reportedly so severe that the trial was stopped early after two years.",

The quality of the evidence makes it unclear whether this translates into fewer referrals to AAA surgery, owing mainly to the small sample sizes of the studies.Antibiotics were generally well tolerated with minimal adverse effects. Propranolol was poorly tolerated by patients in all of the beta-blocker trials and demonstrated only minimal and non-significant protective effects. Further research on beta-blockers for AAA needs to consider the use of drugs other than propranolol.In general, there is surprisingly little high quality evidence on medical treatment for small AAAs, especially in relation to the use of newer beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins.", 
    "931": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children is a rare but devastating condition. Once a critical amount of nephron mass has been lost, progression of CKD is irreversible and results in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and need of renal replacement therapy. The time course of childhood CKD is highly variable. While in children suffering from congenital anomalies of the kidneys and the urinary tract, progression of CKD in general is slow, in children with acquired glomerulopathies, disease progression can be accelerated resulting in ESRD within months. However, irrespective of the underlying kidney disease, hypertension and proteinuria are independent risk factors for progression. Thus, in order to prevent progression, the primary objective of treatment should always aim for efficient control of blood pressure and reduction of urinary protein excretion. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system preserves kidney function not only by lowering blood pressure, but also by reducing proteinuria and exerting additional anti-proteinuric, anti-fibrotic, and anti-inflammatory effects. Besides, intensified blood pressure control, aiming for a target blood pressure below the 50th percentile, may exert additive renoprotective effects. Additionally, other modifiable risk factors, such as anemia, metabolic acidosis, dyslipidemia, and altered bone-mineral homeostasis may also contribute to CKD progression. In conclusion, beyond strict blood pressure control and reduction of urinary protein excretion, identification and treatment of both, renal disease-related and conventional risk factors are mandatory in children with CKD in order to prevent deterioration of kidney function.",

We included women who were Medicaid beneficiaries from at least 3 months prior to last menstrual period to 1 month postdelivery, and were successfully linked to infant records. Maternal exposure to antihypertensive medications was derived from Medicaid pharmacy claim files, and duration of exposure was assigned based on the days' supply dispensed. We identified 1,106,757 Medicaid patients in our cohort, of whom 48,453 (4.4%) were exposed to antihypertensive medications during pregnancy. The prevalence of antihypertensive use increased from 3.5% to 4.9% during the study period. Antihypertensive medication users were older than nonusers, more likely to be white or black, and more likely to have comorbid diabetes mellitus and renal disease. Overall, 1.9% of pregnant women were exposed during the first trimester, 1.7% during the second trimester, and 3.2% during the third trimester. The range of antihypertensive medications to which patients were exposed was highly heterogeneous and frequently included agents other than methyldopa or labetalol. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor exposure, which is contraindicated in late pregnancy, occurred in 928 (4.9%) antihypertensive medication users in the second trimester and 383 (1.1%) in the third trimester.

Nine pigs were subjected to four periods of coronary BK infusion (4 min) and another nine animals to four periods of SS (4 min). Finally, 10 min of I/R was induced in both groups. The single-peaked BK-induced tPA release declined toward baseline by repeated infusions, but tPA release reappeared during I/R. In contrast, total tPA release during repeated SS and subsequent I/R was more stable, and SS-induced total tPA and norepinephrine (NE) releases were strongly correlated. Surprisingly, the instantaneous SS-induced tPA release was biphasic with a stable first peak, and a second peak declining toward baseline by repeated stimulations. The fluctuations in cardiac release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and the endogenous BK inhibitor angiotensin-converting enzyme, could not explain the diverging tPA release patterns. Different tPA release patterns were demonstrated during SS and BK stimulation, as well as diverging responses to repeated stimulations and subsequent I/R. This study demonstrates strong association between tPA and NE during SS and possibly two different sources or mechanisms for SS-induced tPA release.",

We compared chlorthalidone, the active control, with each of the other three agents with respect to the primary outcome, fatal coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction, and several other clinical endpoints. The arms were similar with respect to the primary endpoint, although some differences were found for other endpoints, most notably heart failure. Although the desire was to achieve similar blood pressure reductions in the four arms, we found some systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure differences. A natural question is to what degree can observed treatment group differences in cardiovascular outcomes be attributed to these blood pressure differences. The purpose of this paper was to delineate the problems inherent in attempting to answer this question, and to present analyses intended to overcome these problems.",

Qualification of the impurities is the process of acquiring and evaluating data that establishes biological safety of an individual impurity; thus, revealing the need and scope of impurity profiling of drugs in pharmaceutical research. As no stability-indicating method is available for identification of degradation products of trandolapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), under stress testing, the development of an accurate method is needed for quantification and qualification of degradation products. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was used for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of trandolapril and its degradation products. Chromatographic separation was achieved in less than 4 min, with improved peak resolution and sensitivity. Thanks to this method, the kinetics of trandolapril degradation under various operating conditions and the characterization of the structure of the by-products formed during stress testing have been determined. Thereafter, a mechanism of trandolapril degradation in acid and neutral conditions, including all the identified products, was then proposed.",

The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured by the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (TEAC), the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical assay, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP). The ability of the extract to scavenge three specific reactive oxygen species (superoxide radical anion (O(2)(-)), hydroxyl radical (HO()) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))) was also investigated in order to better evaluate its antioxidant properties. Even if the measures of TAC were relatively low, results clearly established an antioxidant potential of SOD-MC that exhibited the highest radical-scavenging activity towards O(2)(-), with a IC(50) 12-fold lower than that of H(2)O(2) or HO(). This lets hypothesis that the antioxidant potential of SOD-MC could be mainly due to its high level of SOD. Moreover, for the first time, an ACE inhibitory activity of SOD-MC (IC(50)=2.4\u00b10.1mg/mL) was demonstrated, showing that its use as a functional food ingredient with potential preventive benefits in the context of hypertension may have important public health implications and should be carefully considered.",

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring for diagnosis of hypertension, though logical, will place an additional financial burden on primary care at a time of austerity. Home blood pressure measurement may be a more practical option. Previous guidance recommended the used of thiazide diuretics as a first-line treatment option.2 Five years later, the new guidelines propose a major change, with an initial emphasis on the use of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, moving the use of thiazide-like diuretics to a third-line option. In addition, bendroflumethiazide, the mainstay of treatment in the UK over many years, has been replaced with chlortalidone, the starting doses of which are not readily available in this country. Cost-effectiveness analysis and a presumed risk of metabolic disorders has guided the rationale for these changes to the therapeutic algorithm, however this may not be robust. Importantly, unless there are special circumstances, reducing the blood pressure in hypertensive patients is more important than the means used to lower it. In future, it will be important to 'personalise' treatment more effectively and base management on lifetime risk.", 
    "974": "IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, has significant morbidity and mortality as 20-40% of patients progress to end-stage renal disease within 20 years of onset. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the progression of IgAN, we systematically evaluated renal biopsies from such patients. This showed that the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway was activated in the mesangium of patients presenting with over 1 g/day proteinuria and elevated blood pressure, but absent in biopsy specimens of patients with IgAN and modest proteinuria (<1 g/day). ERK activation was not associated with elevated galactose-deficient IgA1 or IgG specific for galactose-deficient IgA1 in the serum. In human mesangial cells in vitro, ERK activation through mesangial IgA1 receptor (CD71) controlled pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and was induced by large-molecular-mass IgA1-containing circulating immune complexes purified from patient sera. Moreover, IgA1-dependent ERK activation required renin-angiotensin system as its blockade was efficient in reducing proteinuria in those patients exhibiting substantial mesangial activation of ERK. Thus, ERK activation alters mesangial cell-podocyte crosstalk, leading to renal dysfunction in IgAN. Assessment of MAPK/ERK activation in diagnostic renal biopsies may predict the therapeutic efficacy of renin-angiotensin system blockers in IgAN.", 
    "975": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common manifestation of symptomatic atherosclerosis that leads to a significantly elevated risk of cardiovascular events, including major limb loss, myocardial infarction, stroke and death. The prevalence proportions of PAD increase dramatically with age and appear to progress more aggressively in women than in men. Several studies have indicated that the use of secondary medical prevention is generally insufficient among PAD patients. However, current national and international guidelines recommend lipid-lowering and anti-platelet therapy, supplemented with aggressive blood pressure lowering treatment. We aimed to determine whether there were age-, gender-, geography or time related differences in the use of secondary medical prevention, following primary vascular reconstruction. We also sought to describe the prognoses for the same population, according to the association between the use of ACE/ATII inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor antagonists) or beta blockers and clinical outcomes (all cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, major amputation and/or recurrent vascular surgery) in a population-based, long-term follow-up study. We established a data base by linking four population based administrative and health-care registries. All Danish patients undergoing primary vascular surgical reconstruction due to atherosclerotic disease between 1997 and 2007 were included and identified in the Danish Vascular Registry; a total of 20,761 patients were followed during a median of 582 days (range of 30 to 4,379 days). Data regarding all prescriptions filled by the study population were obtained from the Medical Registry of the Danish Medicines Agency. Study I: Age- and gender-related differences. We found moderate to low use of secondary medical prevention. However, this use has increased in recent years and the age- and gender-related differences in use have been reduced or eliminated. Study II: Geographic or time related differences. The use of evidence-based secondary medical prevention, especially lipid-lowering drugs, increased substantially over time, regardless of socio-demographic and clinical factors. No substantial differences in pharmacological use according to location of residence were observed. Study III: Use of ACE/ATII and prognosis. We found the use of ACE inhibitors to be associated with lower all cause mortality but also an increased long-term risk of recurrent vascular reconstruction and myocardial infarction. Study IV: Use of beta blockers and prognosis. We found beta blocker use to be associated with a lower risk of major amputation, but also an increased risk of new myocardial infarction and stroke. No association were found regarding all cause mortality or the risk of recurrent vascular surgery. In conclusion, the use of secondary medical prevention following primary vascular surgery (between 1996 and 2006 in Denmark) shifted towards a more evidence-based treatment, as reduction in age-, gender- and geography related differences were observed early in the study period. However, recommendations for the current clinical guidelines suggest that additional improvement can be made. The treatment of hypertension in PAD patients is complex, and our results are also complex but indicate that ACE/ATII and beta blockers are safe for use in symptomatic PAD patients.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), and \u03b2-blockers have been used as routine treatment options for heart failure for the majority of patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction who tolerate these agents. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) have also demonstrated significant benefits in the treatment of heart failure, which include a reduction in sudden cardiac death and ventricular remodeling; however, these agents have not been recommended for most patients with heart failure. In the most recent American College of Cardiology Foundation and American Heart Association guidelines, MRAs are recommended for patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV symptoms or previous acute myocardial infarction, provided an absence of contraindications or risk factors for developing hyperkalemia. Based on more recent evidence, it is likely that future recommendations and guidelines will further expand the use of MRAs to patients with mild heart failure as well. These agents have the potential to be recommended nearly as universally as ACE inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers because of the potential to reduce mortality and hospital admissions for heart failure.

The authors tested the additivity of the \u03b2-blocker nebivolol, which has vasodilating activity, with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril in patients with stage 2 diastolic hypertension. The BP effects of placebo (n=93), nebivolol 5 mg to 20 mg daily (n = 185), lisinopril 10 mg to 40 mg daily (n=189), and nebivolol 5 mg to 20 mg + lisinopril 10 mg to 40 mg (n=189) during 6 weeks of treatment were compared. The primary end point was change in diastolic BP (DBP). For the full cohort, baseline BP was 163.8/104.4 mm Hg, mean age was 49.2 years, 58% were men, 62% were white, and 34% were black. DBP fell by 17.2 \u00b1 10.2 mm Hg with the combination, greater than placebo (8.0 \u00b1 9.2, P<.0001), nebivolol (13.3 \u00b1 8.9, P=.0010), and lisinopril (12.0 \u00b1 9.8, P<.0001).

    "999": "BbKI is a kallikrein inhibitor with a reactive site sequence similar to that of kinins, the vasoactive peptides inserted in kininogen moieties. This structural similarity probably contributes to the strong interaction with plasma kallikrein, the enzyme that releases, from high-molecular weight kininogen (HMWK), the proinflammatory peptide bradykinin, which acts on B(2) receptors (B(2)R). BbKI was examined on smooth muscle contraction and Ca(2+) mobilization, in which the kallikrein-kinin system is involved. Contrary to expectations, BbKI (1.8 \u03bcm) increased [Ca(2+)](c) and contraction, as observed with BK (2.0 \u03bcm). Not blocked by B(1) receptors (B(1)R), the BbKI agonistic effect was blocked by the B(2)R antagonist, HOE-140 (6 \u03bcm), and the involvement of B(2)R was confirmed in B(2)R-knockout mice intestine. The same tissue response was obtained using a synthetic peptide derived from the BbKI reactive site structure, more resistant than BK to angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) hydrolysis. Depending on the concentration, BbKI has a dual effect. At a low concentration, BbKI acts as a potent kallikrein inhibitor; however, due to the similarity to BK, in high concentrations, BbKI greatly increases Ca(2+) release from internal storages, as a consequence of its interaction with B(2)R. Therefore, the antagonistic and agonistic effects of BbKI may be considered in conditions of B(2)R involvement.", 
    "1000": "Hypertension is major risk factor leading to cerebrovascular pathologies. N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and renin-angiotensin system are involved in neuronal plasticity, as well as cognitive functions in the hippocampus. In this study, we examined the effects of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor, on the levels of hippocampal NMDAR subunits; NR2A and NR2B in L-NAME (N(\u03b5)-nitro-L-arginine Methyl Ester)-induced hypertensive rats. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured as a marker for lipid peroxidation. Compared with the control group, the MDA level was significantly increased after 8 weeks in the L-NAME-treated group. Rats treated with lisinopril and L-NAME plus lisinopril were found to have significantly decreased hippocampal MDA levels. Regarding the hippocampal concentrations of NR2A and NR2B, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. We demonstrated that lisinopril treatment has no direct regulatory effect on the levels of NR2A and NR2B in the rat hippocampus. Our results showed that Lisinopril could act as an antioxidant agent against hypertension-induced oxidative stress in rat hippocampus. The findings support that the use of lisinopril may offer a good alternative in the treatment of hypertension by reducing not only blood pressure but also prevent hypertensive complications in the brain.", 
    "1001": "Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) improve survival and reduce morbidity in patients with heart failure, reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), and mild-to-severe symptoms, and in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. These clinical benefits are observed in addition to those of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and beta-blockers. The morbidity and mortality benefits of MRAs may be mediated by several proposed actions, including antifibrotic mechanisms that slow heart failure progression, prevent or reverse cardiac remodelling, or reduce arrhythmogenesis. Both eplerenone and spironolactone have demonstrated survival benefits in individual clinical trials. Pharmacologic differences exist between the drugs, which may be relevant for therapeutic decision making in individual patients. Although serious hyperkalaemia events were reported in the major MRA clinical trials, these risks can be mitigated through appropriate patient selection, dose selection, patient education, monitoring, and follow-up. When used appropriately, MRAs significantly improve outcomes across the spectrum of patients with HF-REF.", 
    "1002": "Hypertension and heart failure (HF) are common diseases that, despite advances in medical therapy, continue to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, innovative therapeutic strategies are needed. Inhibition of the neutral endopeptidase (NEPinh) had been investigated as a potential novel therapeutic approach because of its ability to increase the plasma concentrations of the natriuretic peptides (NPs). Indeed, the NPs have potent natriuretic and vasodilator properties, inhibit the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, lower sympathetic drive, and have antiproliferative and antihypertrophic effects. Such potentially beneficial effects can be theoretically achieved by the use of NEPinh. However, studies have shown that NEPinh alone does not result in clinically meaningful blood pressure-lowering actions. More recently, NEPinh has been used in combination with other cardiovascular agents, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antagonists of the angiotensin receptor. Another future possible combination would be the use of NEPinh with NPs or their newly developed chimeric peptides. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the use and effects of NEPinh alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents for the treatment of human cardiovascular disease such as HF and hypertension.",

Four thousand eight hundred and fifty-three patients with total cholesterol \u22646.5 mmol/L (250 mg/L) were further randomized to atorvastatin or placebo. Over 5.5 years, there were 399 CV events (fatal coronary heart disease (CHD), non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, and fatal and non-fatal stroke), 96 cases of new-onset renal impairment, and 220 deaths. Cases were age, sex, and ethnicity matched with 1525 controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between CV events, renal impairment, all-cause mortality, and PRA. For those on antihypertensive (AHT) treatment at the baseline (91.5%), PRA was influenced by prior drug treatment. The median (inter-quartile range; ng/mL/h) levels were 1.04 (0.52, 1.3) for BBs, 1.30 (0.78, 2.72) for CCBs, 1.56 (0.91, 3.50) for diuretics, and 2.33 (1.30, 5.57) for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CV and other events were estimated for 1-SD increase in log-transformed PRA levels and by categorizing PRA into quartiles with the lowest as the referent category.

Their absorption values were in the range of 25-60%, while calculated KOWWIN logP values were from -0.94 to 6.61. Additionally, perindopril (absorption 70%, KOWWIN logP 2.59) and moexipril (absorption 22%, KOWWIN logP 3.36) were introduced for the theoretical considerations due to their high/low absorption values which were on the opposite sites in comparison with the majority of ACE inhibitors (25-60%). In the theoretical considerations it was shown that the solubility data (logS) must be considered, as independent variable, simultaneously with KOWWIN logP to obtain reliable correlation (r(2)=0.7208) between absorption and ACE inhibitors lipophilicity. As the main topic of this study, the relationships between literature available and absorption data predicted by multiple linear regression (MLR) using logS values besides chromatographically obtained hydrophobicity parameters C(0) (r(2)=0.6424) or \u03c6(0) (r(2)=0.6762) were studied proving that these parameters could be used in ACE inhibitors absorption evaluation. The UHPLC-MS method provides the direct application of experimentally obtained \u03c6(0) values that is the advantage of this method. For better MLR correlation of ACE inhibitors absorption with C(0) parameters (RP-TLC) and logS, mathematical conversion of C(0) parameters to logC(0) values was necessary based on requisite for probability value of regression analysis (P<0.05).

Ninety-three yeast strains isolated from Colombian Kumis in different geographic regions were molecularly identified, and their milk fermentation performances were determined. Molecular identification evidenced that Galactomyces geotrichum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Clavispora lusitaniae and Candida tropicalis, were the dominant species. Eighteen out of 93 strains produced fermented milk with ACE-inhibitory (ACEI) activity values ranging from 8.69 to 88.19%. Digestion of fermented milk samples by pepsin and pancreatin demonstrated an increase in ACEI activity, with C. lusitaniae KL4A as the best producer of ACEI peptides. Moreover, sensory analysis of the products containing the major ACE-inhibitory activity pointed out that P. kudriavzevii KL84A and Kluyveromyces marxianus KL26A could be selected as potential adjunct starter cultures in Kumis, since they made a considerable contribution to the ACE inhibitory activity and produced fermented milk without bitter taste. In this study we observed that Colombian Kumis can be an excellent vehicle for the isolation of yeasts with a potential to enhance bioactive peptides produced during milk fermentation.",

Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials have found that antihypertensive drug therapy reduces cardiovascular events in patients aged younger than 80 years and in patients aged 80 years and older in the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial. Although the optimal blood pressure treatment goal has not been determined, existing epidemiologic and clinical trial data suggest that a reasonable therapeutic blood pressure goal should be <140/90 mm Hg in patients younger than 80 years and a systolic blood pressure of 140-145 mm Hg if tolerated in patients aged 80 years and older. Non-pharmacologic lifestyle measures should be encouraged both to prevent development of hypertension and as adjunctive therapy in patients with hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics have all reduced cardiovascular events in randomized trials.

Mild stress was induced by applying mild electric foot shocks of 0.15 mA intensity for 0.5 s. The stress-induced alteration in cognition was assessed using a Morris water maze test. The animals were subjected to mild electric foot shocks 5 min before we recorded escape latency time (ELT), an index of learning, during the first 4 days of a 5-day trial in the Morris water maze. The time spent in target quadrant (TSTQ), an index of retrieval, was noted on the fifth day without prior administration of electric foot shock. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), and telmisartan (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg), an angiotensin II receptor blocker, were employed to assess the role of angiotensin neuropeptides. The application of mild electric shocks significantly decreased ELT and increased TSTQ, indicating enhancement in stress-induced learning and memory. However, administration of lisinopril and telmisartan significantly attenuated the stress-induced decrease in ELT and increase in TSTQ. It may be concluded that mild electric foot shock-induced stress triggers the release of angiotensin neuropeptides that may be responsible for memory enhancement.",

    "1027": "Micro- or macroalbuminuria is associated with increased cardiovascular risk factors among patients with type 2 diabetes, but whether albuminuria within the normal range predicts long-term cardiovascular risk is unknown. We evaluated the relationships between albuminuria and cardiovascular events in 1208 hypertensive, normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes from the BErgamo NEphrologic Diabetes Complication Trial (BENEDICT), all of whom received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) therapy at the end of the trial and were followed for a median of 9.2 years. The main outcome was time to the first of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery revascularization; or hospitalization for heart failure. Overall, 189 (15.6%) of the patients experienced a main outcome event (2.14 events/100 patient-years); 24 events were fatal. Albuminuria independently predicted events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.08). Second-degree polynomial multivariable analysis showed a continuous nonlinear relationship between albuminuria and events without thresholds.

This relationship was similar in the subgroup originally randomly assigned to non-ACEI therapy. Among those originally receiving ACEI therapy, however, the event rate was uniformly low and was not significantly associated with albuminuria. Taken together, among normoalbuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes, any degree of measurable albuminuria bears significant cardiovascular risk. The association with risk is continuous but is lost with early ACEI therapy.", 
    "1028": "ACE type 2 (ACE2) functions as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system by cleaving angiotensin II (AII) into angiotensin 1-7 (A1-7). This study assessed the role of endogenous ACE2 in maintaining insulin sensitivity. Twelve-week-old male ACE2 knockout (ACE2KO) mice had normal insulin sensitivities when fed a standard diet. AII infusion or a high-fat, high-sucrose (HFHS) diet impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity more severely in ACE2KO mice than in their wild-type (WT) littermates. The strain difference in glucose tolerance was not eliminated by an AII receptor type 1 (AT1) blocker but was eradicated by A1-7 or an AT1 blocker combined with the A1-7 inhibitor (A779). The expression of GLUT4 and a transcriptional factor, myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) 2A, was dramatically reduced in the skeletal muscles of the standard diet-fed ACE2KO mice. The expression of GLUT4 and MEF2A was increased by A1-7 in ACE2KO mice and decreased by A779 in WT mice. A1-7 enhanced upregulation of MEF2A and GLUT4 during differentiation of myoblast cells. In conclusion, ACE2 protects against high-calorie diet-induced insulin resistance in mice. This mechanism may involve the transcriptional regulation of GLUT4 via an A1-7-dependent pathway.",

    "1033": "In the present study it was hypothesized that voluntary aerobic exercise favours a pro-fibrotic phenotype and promotes adverse remodelling in hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) in an angiotensin II-dependent manner. To test this, female SHRs at the age of 1 year were started to perform free running wheel exercise. Captopril was used to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Normotensive rats and SHRs kept in regular cages were used as sedentary controls. Training intensity, expressed as mean running velocity, was positively correlated with the left ventricular mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b2(1), collagen-III and biglycan but negatively correlated with the ratio of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA)2a to Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX). A pro-fibrotic phenotype was verified by Picrosirius red staining. Sixty-seven per cent of SHRs performing free running wheel exercise died either spontaneously or had to be killed during a 6 month follow-up. In the presence of captopril, aerobic exercise did not show a similar positive correlation between training intensity and the expression of fibrotic markers. Moreover, in SHRs receiving captopril and performing free running wheel exercise, a training intensity-dependent reverse remodelling of the SERCA2a-to-NCX ratio was observed. None of these rats died spontaneously or had to be killed. In captopril-treated SHRs performing exercise, expression of mRNA for decorin, a natural inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2(1), was up-regulated. Despite these differences between SHR-training groups with and without captopril, positive training effects (lower resting heart rate and no progression of hypertension) were found in both groups. In conclusion, high aerobic exercise induces an angiotensin II-dependent adverse remodelling in chronic pressure overloaded hearts. However, high physical activity can potentially induce reverse remodelling in the presence of RAS inhibition.",

    "1036": "In this study, 13\u200a832 patients with incident pneumonia from the stroke patient population were enrolled. After adjustment for time-varying confounding factors, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use was associated with a decreased pneumonia risk (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.68-0.87) and a significant dose-response relationship (P \u200a<\u200a 0.01). The pneumonia risk associated with angiotensin II receptor blockers use was not significant (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.87-1.19).", 
    "1037": "Our study revealed a significant protective effect with dose-response relationship of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use on hospitalization for pneumonia among stroke patients. Further studies to confirm the protective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use on pneumonia risk are warranted.", 
    "1038": "Generic substitution is a major cause of medical mistakes in the general population. Danish legislation obligates pharmacies to substitute prescribed medicine with the cheapest equivalent formulation, despite variations in product name, packaging, shape and colour. Consequently, medical mistakes occur. Scientific evidence on the consequences of generic substitution is sparse. Call upon fellow health workers to report medical mistakes to the national entities and scientific peers, in order to increase awareness and scientific evidence about the problem.", 
    "1039": "High Na(+) intake is a reality in nowadays and is frequently accompanied by renal and cardiovascular alterations. In this study, renal mechanisms underlying perinatal Na(+) overload-programmed alterations in Na(+) transporters and the renin/angiotensin system (RAS) were investigated, together with effects of short-term treatment with enalapril in terms of reprogramming molecular alterations in kidney.", 
    "1040": "Male adult Wistar rats were obtained from dams maintained throughout pregnancy and lactation on a standard diet and drinking water (control) or 0.17 M NaCl (saline group). Enalapril (100 mg/l), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered for three weeks after weaning. Ninety day old offspring from dams that drank saline presented with proximal tubules exhibiting increased (Na(+)+K(+))ATPase expression and activity. Ouabain-insensitive Na(+)-ATPase activity remained unchanged but its response to angiotensin II (Ang II) was lost. PKC, PKA, renal thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), macrophage infiltration and collagen deposition markedly increased, and AT(2) receptor expression decreased while AT(1) expression was unaltered. Early treatment with enalapril reduced expression and activity of (Na(+)+K(+))ATPase, partially recovered the response of Na(+)-ATPase to Ang II, and reduced PKC and PKA activities independently of whether offspring were exposed to high perinatal Na(+) or not. In addition, treatment with enalapril per se reduced AT(2) receptor expression, and increased TBARS, macrophage infiltration and collagen deposition. The perinatally Na(+)-overloaded offspring presented high numbers of Ang II-positive cortical cells, and significantly lower circulating Ang I, indicating that programming/reprogramming impacted systemic and local RAS.", 
    "1041": "Maternal Na(+) overload programmed alterations in renal Na(+) transporters and in its regulation, as well as severe structural lesions in adult offspring. Enalapril was beneficial predominantly through its influence on Na(+) pumping activities in adult offspring. However, side effects including down-regulation of PKA, PKC and AT(2) receptors and increased TBARS could impair renal function in later life.", 
    "1042": "The endocannabinoid system reportedly plays a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. This system is expressed also in adipose tissue, which could thus be involved in cardiac disorders through modulation of metabolically triggered inflammation. The current study aims to determine the relevance of the endocannabinoid system in epicardial adipose tissue in heart disease.", 
    "1043": "Expression of the endocannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, and of the endocannabinoid-degrading enzyme, fatty acid amidohydrolase, and activation of protein kinase A (PKA), phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible (i)NOS, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) (a member of the reperfusion-injury salvage kinase pathway), were analyzed by Western blot in patients after coronary artery bypass surgery (ischemics; N = 18) or valve surgery (nonischemics; N = 15) and in preadipocytes isolated from epicardial adipose tissue.", 
    "1044": "In ischemics, the CB1-to-CB2 expression ratio shifted toward CB1 and was accompanied by higher PKA activation. In contrast, in nonischemics, CB2, fatty acid amidohydrolase, PLC and PKC, and ERK1/2 were upregulated. Moreover, NO production and iNOS-to-eNOS ratios were higher in preadipocytes from ischemics.", 
    "1045": "These results show a different modulation and functioning of the endocannabinoid system in ischemics compared with nonischemics. Hence, while CB2, PLC and PKC, ERK1/2, and eNOS are more strongly expressed in patients without ischemic heart disease, high CB1 and PKA expression is associated with low survival intracellular pathway activation and high iNOS activation in ischemic heart disease patients. The changes in the endocannabinoid system in ischemics may contribute to cardiac dysfunction and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target.", 
    "1046": "This report provides a review of early and late effects of radiation in normal tissues and organs with respect to radiation protection. It was instigated following a recommendation in Publication 103 (ICRP, 2007), and it provides updated estimates of 'practical' threshold doses for tissue injury defined at the level of 1% incidence. Estimates are given for morbidity and mortality endpoints in all organ systems following acute, fractionated, or chronic exposure. The organ systems comprise the haematopoietic, immune, reproductive, circulatory, respiratory, musculoskeletal, endocrine, and nervous systems; the digestive and urinary tracts; the skin; and the eye. Particular attention is paid to circulatory disease and cataracts because of recent evidence of higher incidences of injury than expected after lower doses; hence, threshold doses appear to be lower than previously considered. This is largely because of the increasing incidences with increasing times after exposure. In the context of protection, it is the threshold doses for very long follow-up times that are the most relevant for workers and the public; for example, the atomic bomb survivors with 40-50years of follow-up. Radiotherapy data generally apply for shorter follow-up times because of competing causes of death in cancer patients, and hence the risks of radiation-induced circulatory disease at those earlier times are lower. A variety of biological response modifiers have been used to help reduce late reactions in many tissues. These include antioxidants, radical scavengers, inhibitors of apoptosis, anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, growth factors, and cytokines. In many cases, these give dose modification factors of 1.1-1.2, and in a few cases 1.5-2, indicating the potential for increasing threshold doses in known exposure cases. In contrast, there are agents that enhance radiation responses, notably other cytotoxic agents such as antimetabolites, alkylating agents, anti-angiogenic drugs, and antibiotics, as well as genetic and comorbidity factors. Most tissues show a sparing effect of dose fractionation, so that total doses for a given endpoint are higher if the dose is fractionated rather than when given as a single dose. However, for reactions manifesting very late after low total doses, particularly for cataracts and circulatory disease, it appears that the rate of dose delivery does not modify the low incidence. This implies that the injury in these cases and at these low dose levels is caused by single-hit irreparable-type events. For these two tissues, a threshold dose of 0.5Gy is proposed herein for practical purposes, irrespective of the rate of dose delivery, and future studies may elucidate this judgement further.", 
    "1047": "The preferred initial treatment for patients with stable coronary artery disease is the best available medical therapy. We hypothesized that in patients with functionally significant stenoses, as determined by measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) plus the best available medical therapy would be superior to the best available medical therapy alone.", 
    "1048": "In patients with stable coronary artery disease for whom PCI was being considered, we assessed all stenoses by measuring FFR. Patients in whom at least one stenosis was functionally significant (FFR, \u22640.80) were randomly assigned to FFR-guided PCI plus the best available medical therapy (PCI group) or the best available medical therapy alone (medical-therapy group). Patients in whom all stenoses had an FFR of more than 0.80 were entered into a registry and received the best available medical therapy. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, or urgent revascularization.", 
    "1049": "Recruitment was halted prematurely after enrollment of 1220 patients (888 who underwent randomization and 332 enrolled in the registry) because of a significant between-group difference in the percentage of patients who had a primary end-point event: 4.3% in the PCI group and 12.7% in the medical-therapy group (hazard ratio with PCI, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.53; P<0.001). The difference was driven by a lower rate of urgent revascularization in the PCI group than in the medical-therapy group (1.6% vs. 11.1%; hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.30; P<0.001); in particular, in the PCI group, fewer urgent revascularizations were triggered by a myocardial infarction or evidence of ischemia on electrocardiography (hazard ratio, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.43; P<0.001). Among patients in the registry, 3.0% had a primary end-point event.", 
    "1050": "In patients with stable coronary artery disease and functionally significant stenoses, FFR-guided PCI plus the best available medical therapy, as compared with the best available medical therapy alone, decreased the need for urgent revascularization. In patients without ischemia, the outcome appeared to be favorable with the best available medical therapy alone. (Funded by St. Jude Medical; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01132495.).", 
    "1051": "Short term randomized trials have shown the effectiveness of a fixed dose combination therapy (known as Polypill) on reducing blood pressure and serum cholesterol but the impact of Polypill on cardiovascular disease risk or mortality has not yet been directly investigated. Previous studies combined the effects of each component assuming a multiplicative joint risk model that may have led to overestimating the combined effects. We conducted an updated meta-analysis of randomized trials of anti-hypertensives, and aspirin. We used the estimated effect sizes applying a more conservative assumption to estimate the number of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke deaths that could have been averted by Polypill in Iranians aged 55 years or older in 2006.", 
    "1052": "We searched Medline and reviewed previous meta-analyses to select randomized trials on Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-inhibitors, thiazides, aspirin, and statins. We used a random-effects model to pool relative risks for each component and estimated the joint relative risks using multiplicative and additive assumptions for 4 combinations of Polypill components. We used age- and cause-specific mortality, separately by gender, and estimated the number of preventable deaths from IHD and stroke.", 
    "1053": "Under the additive joint RR assumption, the standard Polypill formulation was estimated to prevent 28500 (95% CI: 21700, 34100) IHD deaths and 12700 (95% CI: 8800, 15900) stroke deaths. Removing aspirin from the combination decreased preventable IHD deaths by 15% under the additive assumption (5600 deaths) and by 21% under the multiplicative assumption (6800 deaths) and reduced preventable stroke deaths under both additive and multiplicative assumptions by 3% (300 deaths). There was no significant difference between Polypill combinations with anti-hypertensive agents in full-dose or half-dose.", 
    "1054": "Polypill can prevent a large number of IHD and stroke deaths in Iran. The cost-effectiveness, feasibility, and acceptability of this prevention strategy remain to be investigated.", 
    "1055": "Angioedema secondary to the use of ACE-inhibitors is well recognised, with a high rate of airway intervention required. Several treatments have been described, but little evidence exists for any of them. We describe the successful use of fresh frozen plasma in two cases.", 
    "1056": "This proficiency testing program is established to evaluate the pharmaceutical preparation analysis capacity of laboratories recommended by 18 countries and economies. It was authorized by Asia Pacific Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (APLAC), and organized by Shanghai Institute for Food and Drug Control (SIFDC) and China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment (CNAS). The 0.3sigma test is used to evaluate the homogeneity and stability of the proficiency testing sample. The results of the laboratories were assessed by Z-score. The robust average and the robust standard deviation of the participants' results were calculated as assigned value and standard deviation for performance assessment of hydrochlorothiazide and captopril using robust statistics. Thirty-three of 38 laboratories recommended by 18 countries and economies sent their results back. Twenty-four laboratories' results were observed as satisfactory. Five laboratories were identified as having reported at least one questionable result. Four laboratories were identified as having reported at least one unsatisfactory result.",

    "1059": "Of 50119 potentially eligible patients, we matched 11498 cases with 11498 controls. Mortality at 30 days was 13%; 34% used statins, 30% ACE inhibitors, and 4% ARBs. In adjusted models, prior statin use was associated with decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], .68-.82) and mechanical ventilation (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, .70-.94), and inpatient use with decreased mortality (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, .59-.78) and mechanical ventilation (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, .60-.90). Prior (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, .80-.97) and inpatient (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, .48-.69) ACE inhibitor use was associated with decreased mortality. Prior (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, .58-.92) and inpatient ARB use (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, .30-.72) was only associated with decreased mortality. Use of all 3 medications was associated with reduced length of stay.", 
    "1060": "Statins, and to a lesser extent ACE inhibitors and ARBs, are associated with improved pneumonia-related outcomes. Prospective cohort and randomized controlled trials are needed to examine potential mechanisms of action and whether acute initiation at the time of presentation with these infections is beneficial.", 
    "1061": "In the fermentation of milk by certain lactic acid bacteria, casein is degraded into bioactive tripeptides shown to lower blood pressure in experimental animal models and in mildly hypertensive humans. This effect is suggested to result mainly in inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme 1 (ACE-1).Due to the complexity of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), several other enzymes than ACE-1 can participate in the production of vasoactive components. Therefore, in the present study we investigated effects of tripeptides isoleucine-proline-proline (IPP), valine-proline-proline (VPP) and leucine-proline-proline (LPP) on some endothelial enzymes that are important in RAS or otherwise have a role in the endothelial function. The enzymes investigated were renin, chymase, neutral endopeptidase (NEP), prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), cathepsin G, endothelin converting enzyme 1 (ECE-1), and cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX -1 and COX-2).The tripeptides inhibited prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) dose-dependently. IPP was the most potent inhibitor (IC50 486\u00b195\u2009\u00b5M). Contrary, cathepsin G was activated by IPP, VPP and LPP as well as the amino acids proline and isoleucine. The other investigated enzymes were not affected. Inhibition of POP and activation of cathepsin G do not explain the blood pressure lowering effects of the tripeptides. Thus the inhibition of ACE-1 remains the most plausible mechanism of the antihypertensive effects of the tripeptides.", 
    "1062": "This review highlights factors of importance for the clinical care of pregnant women with pregestational diabetes and microalbuminuria or diabetic nephropathy with particular focus on the role of intensive antihypertensive treatment during pregnancy. Most information in the literature comes from women with type 1 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy, but this is probably also valid for women with type 2 diabetes. Careful counseling of women with diabetic nephropathy before pregnancy with estimation of the risk for the mother and fetus is important. Pregnancy does not result in worsening of kidney function in women with diabetic nephropathy and normal serum creatinine, but pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and preterm delivery are common. Intensive metabolic control before and during pregnancy, low-dose aspirin from 12 gestational weeks onward, and intensive antihypertensive treatment are important. Methyldopa, labetalol, and nifedipine are regarded safe in pregnancy, whereas angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, AngII antagonists, or statins should be paused before pregnancy. Case series and pathophysiological studies support the use of a stringent goal for BP and albumin excretion in pregnant women with diabetic nephropathy. Screening for diabetic retinopathy before and during pregnancy is mandatory and laser treatment should be performed if indicated. Pregnancy outcome in women with diabetic nephropathy has improved considerably with a take-home-baby rate of approximately 95%. Further research on the benefits and risks of intensive antihypertensive treatment in this population is needed."
