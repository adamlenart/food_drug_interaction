Short-term outcomes are most relevant to the practitioner and include such measures as blood pressure control, laboratory changes, and quality of life. In contrast, long-term outcomes, typically measured in randomized clinical trials, are of particular interest to policy makers and guidelines writers, and focus on whether treatments affect survival and the incidence of major cardiovascular events. Intermediate-term outcomes, usually measurable within months of starting treatment, deal with such clinical surrogates as treatment-induced changes in left ventricular structure, arterial compliance, and renal function. No longer are the traditional short-term outcomes adequate to describe a new drug; hypertension specialists, formulary committees, healthcare economists, and even regulatory agencies now expect sponsors to plan studies that define a drug's full range of outcomes. This article briefly discusses some of the criteria for these outcome measures.", 
    "1": "In the paper available information concerning the influence of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) on cough, bronchial hyperreactivity and bronchoconstriction are reviewed. Cough occurs in 0.7% to 19% of patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors according to various reports. In the mechanism of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough accumulation of bradykinin and substance P due to decreased degradation of this mediators caused by ACE-I may be involved. Part of tussive effect may be mediated via prostaglandins and histamine. In a few studies symptoms of airway obstruction and asthma worsening in relation to treatment with this drugs was reported. However, majority of reports suggest safety in taking ACE-I by patients with asthma. The only effective method to relieve angiotensin converting enzyme-induced cough is a drug withdrawal. The change of drugs within the whole class of ACE-I does not bring effect.",

    "3": "Cap 100 mg.kg-1.d-1 was given p.o. to SHR. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), left ventricular weight (LVW), and body weight (BW) were measured at 16-wk old. The level of angiotensin II (Ang II), c-myc mRNA, and oncoprotein were determined by immunohistochemical method, Northern blot, and Western blot, respectively.", 
    "4": "Cap reduced SBP, LVW/BW in SHR, with a decrease of Ang II and c-myc expression in LV. Local cardial Ang II mainly distributed in cardiomyocytes. Cap inhibited cardial Ang II production and c-myc expression (histochemical staining intensity index, 0.49 +/- 0.04 vs 0.83 +/- 0.24, P < 0.01). The c-myc oncoprotein was prevailingly located in cardiac fibroblasts. The c-myc oncoprotein in Cap treated SHR was lower than that of WKY.", 
    "5": "High expression of c-myc in fibroblasts played an important role in the development of LVH in SHR. Inhibitory effects of Cap on LVH was associated with a decreased myocardial Ang II and interstitial fibroblasts c-myc expression. The c-myc oncoprotein post-transcriptional translation was also interrupted by Cap.", 
    "6": "Aldosterone biosynthesis in kidney has been proved by means of kidney perfusion in vitro, high performance liquid chromatography, radioimmunoassay and TR-PCR, indicating that aldosterone biosynthesis is possible in tissues other than adrenal. Bilateral nephrectomy was carried out in male Wistar rats and the plasma renin activity would disappear after 30 hours. However, RT-PCR showed that the vasculature in the nephrectomized rats was still able to express renin mRNA. It means that the vasculature is different from the heart which depends on taking up renin from the circulation, while the vasculature takes renin produced locally in its own tissue to initiate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), inhibits not only the production of angiotensin II, but also the synthesis of aldosterone in the vasculature. ACEI reversion of vascular remodeling is probably related with its inhibition of aldosterone synthesis in the vasculature.", 
    "7": "Ninty patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension (EH) were randomly divided into three groups and treated with Enalapril (E), Metoprolol (M) and Nifedipine (N) respectively. After a six-week-treatment, SBP and DBP of each of the three groups decreased significantly (vs. pre-treatment, P < 0.001). Plasma concentration of ET, NO, cGAMP and MDA in group M remained unchanged, and that of MDA in group N, especially of the stage II EH, decreased remarkably (vs. pretreatment, P < 0.05; vs. that of stage I EH, P < 0.05). While that of ET, NO, cGMP, and MDA in group E changed significantly (vs. Pretreatment, P < 0.01) and that of ET and MDA of stage II EH in group E exhibited more remarkable changes (vs. that of stage I, P < 0.05). It is suggested that E, and at some degree N, may protect the vascular endothelium from being damaged in EH, and also may contribute to prevent EH from development.",

    "9": "In 45 patients with a high clinical likelihood of renovascular hypertension (RVH) and unimpaired renal function, dynamic imaging was performed after an intravenous bolus injection of 148 MBq (99m)Tc MAG3 for both baseline renoscintigraphy and captopril renography following oral application of 50 mg captopril. RCA was measured according to the Sfakianakis method: RCA = cortical counts at 20 min/counts at peak x100%. An increase in RCA of >/=5% from baseline was considered indicative of RAS. After renography, all patients underwent selective transfemoral angiography with the digital subtraction technique. A luminal reduction of >/=50% was considered as proof of RAS.", 
    "10": "The number of kidneys that had a change of >/=5% in RCA values was 12 (27.2%) in normal kidneys, 7 (58.3%) in the patients with bilateral RAS, 14 (82.3%) in the patients with unilateral RAS, and 21 (72.4%) in overall kidneys with RAS. The positive test ratio in pathologic groups was significantly higher than normal (p < 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of the RCA test were 72.4 and 72.7%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 63.6 and 80%, respectively.", 
    "11": "Quantitative measurements of RCA can be used as a diagnostic parameter of renal artery stenosis and may contribute of the diagnostic accuracy of visual interpretation and other renographic diagnostic criteria.", 
    "12": "Because of its high blood flow and function to excrete and metabolize xenobiotics, the kidney is especially prone to injury by drugs and chemicals. In elderly patients, renal function is also often reduced by age itself or comorbid diseases leading to a high incidence of adverse drug reactions both to the kidney itself and to other organs because of drug accumulation. This paper reviews this issue with specific emphasis on drugs that are often used in elderly subjects such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors, antibiotics, and immunosuppressive drugs.", 
    "13": "Two hormonal systems with opposite effects are activated in congestive heart failure: the renin-angiotensin system that promotes vasoconstriction, cardiac hypertrophy and salt retention, and the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), which has vasorelaxant and natriuretic effects. It could be of therapeutic interest to associate prevention of angiotensin II formation, by inhibition of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE), with potentiation of the ANF effects, by inhibition of neprilysin (NEP).", 
    "14": "The effects of long-term therapy with fasidotril, a mixed NEP/ACE inhibitor, were assessed in rats submitted to coronary artery ligation. Twenty-four hours after ligation, 172 rats were assigned to either placebo or fasidotril therapy (180 mg/kg/day, orally) for 40 weeks. The date of spontaneous death was recorded, myocardial infarct size was determined and rats were classified as having small, moderate or large infarcts.", 
    "15": "In rats with moderate infarcts, fasidotril prolonged survival, 50% of the control rats dying during the 40-week observation period compared with 30% of treated rats (P = 0.04, log-rank test)). In rats with large infarcts, mortality was significantly reduced during the initial 25 weeks of therapy, during which 23.5% of animals died compared to 53.8% in untreated rats (P = 0.015). Cardiac hypertrophy was significantly attenuated by fasidotril for the three infarct sizes. Plasma renin activity was not increased by therapy, which presumably reflected the inhibition of renal renin secretion by endogenous ANF. Fasidotril therapy had no significant effects on arterial blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "16": "In addition to its beneficial effects on survival and cardiac hypertrophy, the lack of hypotensive effect of fasidotril is of interest by reducing the risk of renal hypoperfusion and differentiates the mixed inhibitor from selective ACE inhibitors.", 
    "17": "The finding that the systemic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is not activated in most types of chronic renal disease has led to the suggestion that a local, intrarenal RAS may be an important determinant in the relentless progression of renal disease. Therefore, cell specific changes in various components of the RAS in response to renal mass reduction and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition were examined. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to sham surgery, subtotal nephrectomy (STNx) alone or STNx treated with the ACE inhibitor, perindopril, and sacrificed after 12 weeks. In sham rats, renin mRNA and protein were only present in the juxtaglomerular apparatus. In contrast, in STNx kidneys, renin and angiotensin II expression were noted predominantly in renal tubular epithelial cells in association with overexpression of the prosclerotic cytokine, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). In perindopril-treated STNx rats expression of renin and TGF-beta1 were similar to control animals. These finding indicate that following renal mass reduction there is pathological tubular expression of various components of the RAS. Furthermore, in contrast to the juxtaglomerular apparatus, tubular renin expression was reduced with ACE inhibition. These changes within the intrarenal RAS may be pathogenetically linked to the development of tubulointerstitial injury.", 
    "18": "A change in endothelial function is a common phenomenon in patients with essential hypertension and in animals with hypertension, whether primary or induced by a salt-rich diet. In hypertensive subjects, there may be a change in the synthesis, or the effect, of nitric oxide. Nevertheless, hypertensive vasoconstriction is at present associated, above all, with the degradation of this mediator by free radicals, such as the superoxide anion, released in the dysfunctional vascular endothelium. These radicals are also formed when hypoxanthine is turned into xanthine, and when the latter becomes uric acid, both having been catalysed by the enzyme xanthine oxidase. In physiological conditions, the concentration of superoxide radicals remains low within the organism as a result of its reaction with the superoxide dismutase enzyme. However, in pathological situations, such as arterial hypertension, there may be an increase in the production of these radicals or a deficiency of the superoxide dismutase enzyme. In hypertensive patients, the release of vasoconstrictor peroxides derived from the activity of cyclo-oxygenase in the endothelium and the vascular smooth muscle is also important. The excess free radicals released by the dysfunctional endothelium also stimulate the synthesis of these contracting agents. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that endothelin-1, which is similarly synthesized and released in the vascular endothelium, is the most powerful known endogenous vasoconstrictor. This peptide would therefore play a prominent part in some forms of hypertension. Although no changes in endothelin plasma levels have been found in essential hypertension, there may be an increase in its local concentration. It should be borne in mind that endothelin could strengthen the effect of other vasoconstrictors. Moreover, it may also provoke the release of free radicals and of cyclo-oxygenase-derived vasoconstrictor factors. The latest theories therefore indicate that the increase in vasoconstriction, which characterizes arterial hypertension, is associated with a greater production of free radicals. At the present time, antioxidant agents and xanthine oxydase-inhibiting compounds are being used to treat hypertension and other pathologies linked to endothelial dysfunction. In addition, it is thought that the therapeutic benefit of some anti-hypertensive drugs, such as calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, could be in part due to the inhibition of the production of free radicals that they provoke.", 
    "19": "The prognostically favourable effect of secondary prevention in patients with proven coronary heart disease (CHD: documented myocardial infarction, angiographically proven coronary artery stenosis > 60% and/[or] status after coronary artery surgery) has been demonstrated. But it has not been adequately shown to what extent the guidelines laid down by specialist societies is being followed in routine clinical practice. Nor have there been any large-size standardized investigations of whether in-hospital rehabilitation decreases cardiovascular risk factors. It was the aim of this study to investigate the acute effects on cardiovascular risk factors of in-hospital post-infarction rehabilitation.", 
    "20": "From January to May 1997, at 18 rehabilitation clinics, 2441 consecutive patients (22% women, aged 65 +/- 10 years, 78% men, aged 60 +/- 10 years) with proven CHD were included in this post-infarction after-care (PIN) study. During their hospital stay (26 +/- 5 days) they undertook physical training appropriate for cardiological follow-up treatment, as well as various other modes of treatment to affect risk factors. Diagnosis, treatment and standardized data were prospectively recorded on admission and discharge.", 
    "21": "At discharge the proportions of patients with conventionally defined risk factors were significantly lower than on admission (P < 0.001). The proportion was 8% in patients with arterial blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg (vs. 24% on admission), 5% in smokers (vs. 39% on admission), 30% vs. 60% in patients with cholesterol levels > 200 mg/dl, 67% vs. 87% in those with low density lipids > 100 mg/dl, 15% vs. 22%, in those with serum triglyceride levels > 200 mg/dl, 11% vs. 14% in those with glucose levels > 140 mg/dl, and 15% vs. 18% in patient with a body/mass index > 30 kg/m2. There was an increase in the proportion of patients who during their hospital stay were prescribed additional drugs: from 85% to 86% for acetylsalicylic acid (P < 0.05), 61% to 77% for beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, 33% to 67% for cholesterol synthesis enzyme (CSE) inhibitors, and 51% to 57% for angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.", 
    "22": "Modifiable cardiovascular risk factors can be reduced by various methods of rehabilitation and more intensive drug treatment during hospitalization. By taking account of evidence-based medicine favourable conditions can be created for longterm ambulant after-care.", 
    "23": "Heightened activity of the renin-angiotensin system has been linked to the development of both essential hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. Blunting of the renal vasoconstrictor response to Ang II, specifically when it is corrected by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, is a feature which we have employed as a marker for activation of the intrarenal RAS. In this study we tested the hypothesis that variation in the renal vasodilator response to ACE inhibition in healthy humans reflected the variation in angiotensin-mediated renal vasoconstriction provoked by a low-salt diet.", 
    "24": "We studied 20 healthy people (ages 19 to 57; 15 males) who were in balance on a low sodium diet. Ang II was infused for 45 minutes (3 ng/kg/min), followed by 25 mg captopril and a repeat Ang II infusion; PAH clearance was measured at the end of each interval.", 
    "25": "All subjects responded to captopril with a rise in renal plasma flow (range 43 to 242, mean 118 + 12 ml/min/1.73 m2). Individual vasodilator response to captopril was a strong inverse predictor of the precaptopril vasoconstrictor response to Ang II (P = 0.006, r = -0.59). There was a stronger, positive correlation of the vasodilator response to captopril and enhancement of Ang II responsiveness after captopril (r = 0.57). Plasma renin activity was significantly correlated with captopril response among the large responders (P = 0.003; r = 0.83), but not at all among those with little response.", 
    "26": "These results suggest substantial variation in angiotensin-mediated control of the renal circulation in healthy individuals on a low sodium intake. Variation in the vasodilator response to captopril, correlated with responses to Ang II, provides a measure of that control.", 
    "27": "Regulation of blood pressure is of crucial importance in the management of patients with chronic renal failure. In the predialysis phase, hypertension is common. Apart from volume overload and an inappropriately activated renin-angiotensin system, overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system appears to play a role as well. Sympathetic outflow may be enhanced by elevated Angiotensin II levels. Maintenance treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition normalizes sympathetic overactivity in hypertensive patients with chronic renal failure. In view of the unfavourable role of increased sympathetic activity in cardiovascular disease and prognosis, normalization of sympathetic outflow may be a new treatment goal. Hemodialysis is often complicated by sudden hypotension, causing considerable distress and morbidity. Reduction of blood volume causes sympatho-excitation, vasoconstriction and tachycardia. Sudden hypotension, however, is accompanied by acute withdrawal of sympathetic activity, vasodilation and relative bradycardia, also known as the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. Subtle fluctuations in vasomotor tone in hypovolemic conditions can elicit this reflex. In a series of experiments we showed that reduction of blood volume plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypovolemic hypotension. Autonomic neuropathy and dysfunction of the central opioid system have been proposed as causative mechanisms in dialysis-related hypotension. We, however, could not confirm a pathogenetic role for either mechanism.", 
    "28": "Capillary electrophoresis with a coated capillary was applied to the determination of captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. The proposed method using a 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 5.5 and salicylic acid as an internal standard was developed for the quantitative determination of captopril in commercially available pharmaceuticals.", 
    "29": "In 1994, we reported a 3.4 +/- 0.8 year follow-up of the eight patients who experienced remission of nephrotic syndrome during the Collaborative Study Group-sponsored, multicenter trial of captopril therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes with nephropathy (Captopril Study). Of the 409 patients randomized to treatment on the Captopril Study, 108 had nephrotic syndrome (24-hour proteinuria >/= 3.5 g of protein) at baseline. Of these 108 patients, 8 experienced remission of nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria </= 1.0 g/24 h of protein). Remission was significantly associated with captopril therapy and control of systolic blood pressure. The present study describes the status of these eight patients during a follow-up of 7.7 +/- 0.3 years. Since our previous report, one patient has been lost to follow-up and one patient progressed to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 3.7 years after completion of the Captopril Study. The remaining six patients remain in remission of nephrotic syndrome (mean 24-hour proteinuria, 1.03 +/- 0.3 g of protein) and have stable serum creatinine levels (mean, 1.58 +/- 0.3 mg/dL) and body weights (mean, 69.8 +/- 5.3 kg). Of the six patients, one has discontinued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) therapy because of hypotension. Excluding the patient who progressed to ESRD, the current mean systolic blood pressure is 135 +/- 6 mm Hg and mean diastolic blood pressure is 78 +/- 4 mm Hg. We conclude that long-term remission of nephrotic syndrome and preservation of renal function is achievable in some patients with type 1 diabetes. Control of blood pressure and ACEi therapy appear to be important in achieving long-term remission.", 
    "30": "We retrospectively analyzed the blood pressure (BP) and cardiothoracic index (CTi) of 67 hemodialysis patients with hypertension who could be followed up for at least 8 months. A new treatment policy was adopted, aimed at strict volume control. Dietary salt restriction was strongly emphasized. Ultrafiltration (UF) was applied during regular dialysis sessions and sometimes in additional sessions, as long as BP and CTi remained at greater than normal values. All antihypertensive drugs were discontinued at the beginning of treatment. Average BP decreased from 173 +/- 17/102 +/- 9 to 139 +/- 18/86 +/- 11 mm Hg after 6 months and to 118 +/- 12/73 +/- 6 mm Hg after 36 months. Corresponding values for CTi were 52% +/- 4%, 47% +/- 3%, and 42% +/- 4%, respectively. Conventional relatively short dialysis (three times weekly for at least 4 hours) can achieve normal BPs with prolonged effort in most patients, whereas improvement in heart condition facilitates this.", 
    "31": "Long-term administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) reduces the risk of cardiovascular death, recurrence of MI, and unstable angina, suggesting that captopril may possess antithrombotic properties that have not been clearly elucidated. We assessed the short-term antithrombotic effects of captopril on platelet aggregation, platelet-subendothelium interaction, and the expression of major glycoproteins on platelet surface. A double-blind study was carried out in 25 patients with MI. Blood samples were taken before (baseline) and 12 days after treatment in both the control and captopril groups. Platelet aggregation was tested by conventional aggregometry using common activating agents. Platelet interaction with deeply damaged subendothelial surface was evaluated in a perfusion model, with blood maintained under flow conditions. Deposition of platelets was quantified by using computer-assisted morphometric techniques on histological sections, and it was expressed as a percentage of total vessel surface covered by platelets (CS) and as a ratio between large aggregates (T) and surface covered by platelets (100XT/CS). Glycoprotein expression was measured using flow cytometric techniques. Aggregometric responses showed no significant variations; however, in the captopril group, 100XT/CS decreased after 12 days of treatment (100XT/CS: 36+/-12.1% captopril versus 64+/-8.0% baseline; P=0.005). This parameter was also significantly decreased from that found in control group patients (100XT/CS:67=/-4.5%, P=0.008). Flow cytometry showed a 30% reduction in glycoprotein IIb/IIIa expression (P=0.02). Captopril reduced the formation of large aggregates in a perfusion system, which might be related to a down-regulation of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex on the platelet surface. These results suggest that captopril exerts an antiplatelet effect that may contribute to its beneficial action in MI.", 
    "32": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) have become the treatment of choice for posttransplantation erythrocytosis (PTE). Yet the pathogenesis of PTE and the mechanisms of action of ACEI remain unclear. Therefore, we studied the dose response to erythropoietin (Ep), angiotensin II (AII), and the ACEI enalaprilat on the in vitro proliferation of erythroid progenitors in patients with PTE and in controls. We also evaluated ACE polymorphism in the two groups.", 
    "33": "Twelve patients with PTE and 12 renal transplant patients without PTE were studied. Erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) were isolated from peripheral blood using standard methods. Ep sensitivity was determined for four patients with PTE and three control patients, using 0-3 U/ml Ep. AII dose response was studied in four patients with PTE and five control patients, using AII concentrations of 0-1000 nM. The effect of enalaprilat was studied in eight patients with PTE and eight control patients, using drug concentrations of 0-10 ng/ml. ACE gene insertion/deletion polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction.", 
    "34": "PTE patients showed a significant shift of the Ep response curve to the left compared with controls, with 50% maximal growth occurring at a lower Ep concentration (0.3 U/ml vs. 0.95 U/ml, P<0.025.) However, there was no difference in the number of BFU-E colonies between PTE patients and controls. AII added to the growth medium produced only minor stimulation in both groups. PTE patients showed significant inhibition of BFU-E growth with 10 ng/ml enalaprilat, but controls showed no inhibition of BFU-E growth with ACEI. There was no difference in ACE polymorphism between PTE and controls.", 
    "35": "Our data suggest that PTE is associated with increased erythroid progenitor sensitivity to Ep. The effect of ACEI to decrease hematocrit in patients with PTE may be due to inhibition of red cell precursor growth.", 
    "36": "The elimination of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]) by conventional LDL apheresis techniques can only be achieved in a cell-free medium and thus requires the initial separation of plasma from the blood cells. The present paper describes the first LDL hemoperfusion system which is able to adsorb LDL and Lp(a) directly from whole blood. This simplifies the procedure substantially. The adsorber consists of polyacrylate ligands linked to a modified polyacrylamide matrix. These negatively charged polyacrylate ligands interact with the positively charged apoprotein B moiety of LDL and Lp(a), which results in selective adsorption of these lipoproteins onto the column. Three hypercholesterolemic patients suffering from overt atherosclerotic complications were treated weekly by direct adsorption of lipoproteins (DALI) (n = 20 sessions each). All patients were on the highest tolerated dose of cholesterol synthesis enzyme (CSE) inhibitors. About 1.3 patient blood volumes were treated per session. The anticoagulation was performed with acid citrate dextrose (ACD-A). The following acute reductions were achieved: LDL: 66%; Lp(a): 63%; and triglycerides: 29%. High density lipoprotein (HDL) (-13%) and fibrinogen (-16%) were not substantially reduced. The sessions were essentially uneventful. Due to a low ACD-A infusion rate, no hypocalcemic episodes were registered. One patient on enalapril was treated without complications when this angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor was withdrawn 2 days prior to apheresis. In summary, in our hands, DALI apheresis proved to be a simple, safe, and efficient method of lipid apheresis in hypercholesterolemic patients refractory to conservative lipid lowering therapy.", 
    "37": "Besides reperfusion treatment, which is the most powerful approach to the underlying pathophysiological cause of myocardial infarction, adjunctive therapies should be considered to reduce clinical symptoms, and improve left ventricular function and mortality rates. Randomized clinical trials and overviews of adjunctive therapy with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors showed that these treatments may further reduce mortality rates by approximately 10%. On the basis of this evidence, guidelines suggest that (1) all patients with acute myocardial infarction who do not have clear contraindications should be treated within 24 hours from the onset of symptoms with intravenous beta-blockers. If tolerated, the treatment should be continued for at least 2 to 3 years and perhaps longer; (2) ACE inhibitor treatment should be started during the first day after myocardial infarction in most patients after timely and careful observation of the patient's hemodynamic and clinical status and after administration of routinely recommended treatments (thrombolysis, aspirin, and beta-blockers). In the patients showing neither clinical symptoms nor instrumental signs of left ventricular dysfunction, ACE inhibitor treatment can be stopped at the time of hospital discharge and ventricular function reevaluated after an adequate period of time.", 
    "38": "Pulmonary function abnormalities participate in causing exercise disability in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Impaired pulmonary gas transfer is one of these abnormalities. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors improve diffusion for carbon monoxide and exercise capacity, an effect that is seemingly mediated through prostaglandin activation because it is inhibited by cyclooxygenase blockade with aspirin. This suggests the possibility that aspirin may disturb the pulmonary function and exercise ability in CHF, at least in those patients who are taking ACE inhibitors. This study was aimed at probing this hypothesis.", 
    "39": "A dose of 325 mg aspirin was given daily for 8 weeks to 26 consecutive patients with primary dilated cardiomyopathy (New York Heart Association class II or III) whose current outpatient antifailure therapy included (group 1, 18 cases) or did not include (group 2, 8 cases) an ACE inhibitor in addition to digoxin and furosemide. During the study ACE inhibition was continued in group 1 by giving enalapril 20 mg daily.", 
    "40": "Tests repeated at 8 weeks proved that aspirin was deleterious in group 1. Compared with run-in, rest carbon dioxide, peak exercise oxygen uptake (peak VO(2 )), and tidal volume levels were diminished in this group; the ratio of exercise minute ventilation to carbon dioxide production (VE/VCO(2)) was augmented and its variations were inversely related to those of peak VO(2). Similar results were not observed in group 2; however, once this part of the study was completed and enalapril was included in the current therapeutic regimen, an inhibitory effect of aspirin on carbon dioxide, peak VO(2), peak tidal volume, and VE/VCO(2) at 1 L levels became evident and was similar to that observed in group 1.", 
    "41": "Aspirin does not affect ventilation efficiency and peak VO(2 ) in patients with CHF not taking ACE inhibitors, but it worsens the pulmonary diffusion for carbon monoxide, VO(2 ), and the ventilatory response to exercise in the presence of ACE inhibition. This may be relevant in patients with CHF from ischemic heart disease. Whether the same may be true of smaller aspirin doses was not investigated in this study.", 
    "42": "We evaluated whether elevated blood pressure (BP) levels with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) affect the in-hospital course, short-term, and 1-year outcome. Data were derived from a nationwide survey of 2,212 consecutive patients with AMI. Patients were stratified into 3 groups according to admission BP levels: 1,320 patients had normal BP, 840 patients had high BP, and 52 patients had excessive BP. In-hospital (7 days) course, short-term (30 days), and 1-year outcome was compared between the groups. The 3 groups were similar with respect to age, but patients with excessive BP were more likely to be women and have a history of systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The rate of thrombolytic therapy was similar among the 3 groups, but patients with excessively elevated BP were treated during hospitalization much more often with beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics. The incidence of stroke, transient ischemic attack, and bleeding complications were comparable in the 3 groups. In-hospital mortality was 5.0% , 4.0%, and 1.9% in the normal, high, and excessively elevated BP groups, respectively (p = 0.19). The short-term rehospitalization or mortality rate was similar among the 3 groups. The 1-year mortality rate was 12.3%, 14.1%, and 10.2% in the normal, high, and excessively elevated BP groups, respectively (p = 0.61). A multivariate logistic regression analysis yielded age, women, and Killip class > or = 2 as the only significant predictors of mortality during follow-up. Thus, with the current medical therapy, excessively elevated BP levels with AMI is not associated with a worse short-term or 1-year outcome.",

Apart from optimum hypotensive effect and modulating influence on morphofunctional parameters of the heart losartan was found to be endowed with a broad spectrum of neurohumoral effects (reduction in the ejection of catecholamines, natriuretic hormone, stabilization of indices for the renin-angiotensin system etc.). Moreover, the given drug preparation does not have appreciable effect on the activity of the kallikrein-kinin system, by which property it differs favourably from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "48": "Submitted in the paper are data on clinical, hemodynamic, and neurohumoral effects of monotherapy with an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme berlipril (enalapril maleate) and a calcium antagonist of the benzothiazepine series retalzem (diltiazem resinate) versus their combination therapy. The combination therapy offers a number of important advantages over monotherapy with the above-named agents, consisting in apparent hypotensive action and a greater activation of endothelium-derived vasodilating and antiaggregation substances.", 
    "49": "Overall, forty-five patients with essential hypertension (EH) were examined. EH patients revealed dysbalance between lipid peroxidation and the antioxidant system. These disorders were found to correlate, to a certain extent, with severity of the malady, and to affect the character of the course of the process. Enalapril in a dose of 2.5 to 20 mg for 15 days, along with its hypotensive effect, has an antioxidant action on the metabolic processes at the expense of increase in the activity of enzymes of the antioxidant defense, such as catalase and peroxidase, which fact leads to augmentation of the antiperoxidative potential and prevention of further EH progression.", 
    "50": "In this study, telmisartan, a new angiotensin AT ( 1 ) receptor antagonist given as monotherapy and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), was compared with lisinopril as monotherapy and in combination with HCTZ. This 52-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, dose-titration study of 578 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension (mean diastolic blood pressure [DBP], >/=95 mm Hg), compared the efficacy and safety of telmisartan (n = 385) with lisinopril (n = 193). Dosage could be increased for both telmisartan (40 --> 80 --> 160 mg) and lisinopril (10 --> 20 --> 40 mg) at each of the first 2 monthly visits if DBP control (<90 mm Hg) had not been established. Once DBP control was established, patients entered the 48-week maintenance period. During this period, the dose of the study drug was fixed, although open-label HCTZ at 12.5 mg or 25 mg was added, when needed, to regain DBP control. At the end of the titration period, DBP control was achieved on monotherapy by 67% and 63% of the telmisartan and lisinopril patients, respectively. At the end of the maintenance period, supine DBP was controlled in 83% and 87% of the telmisartan and lisinopril patients, respectively, with systolic blood pressure over DBP reductions of 23.8/16.6 mm Hg for telmisartan and 19.9/15.6 mm Hg for lisinopril. Treatment-related side effects occurred in fewer telmisartan-treated patients (28%) than in lisinopril-treated patients (40%; P =.001). Significantly fewer patients (P =.018) receiving telmisartan experienced treatment-related cough (3% v 7%), and cough led to discontinuation significantly less often (P =.007) with telmisartan treatment than with lisinopril treatment (0.3% v 3.1%). In addition, two cases of angioedema were observed, both in the lisinopril group. The selective AT (1) receptor antagonist, telmisartan, is extremely effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate hypertension both as monotherapy and in combination with HCTZ and is at least comparable in efficacy to lisinopril, with a tolerability profile that may offer advantages in terms of a reduced incidence of adverse events.", 
    "51": "The main pharmacodynamic difference between angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACE-i) and angiotensin-II-receptor antagonists (AII-r) is that ACE-i increase levels of bradykinin, which, in addition to vasodilation, may cause a decrease in insulin resistance. Hypertensive patients with diabetes type II suffering from side effects from ACE-i are frequently changed over to AII-r. The objectives of this study were (1) to study whether this procedure reduces metabolic control, (2) to study effects on blood pressure and forearm blood flow (FLOW), and (3) to study possible associations between the variables hemoglobin A (1c) (HbA(1c)) and FLOW. A self-controlled sequential comparison is required to address such questions. Sixteen patients were treated with 10 mg enalapril or equipotent doses of other ACE-i for 6 months and subsequently with the AII-r losartan at 50 mg daily for 6 more months. Patients were examined at the outpatient clinic every 4 to 8 weeks during the trial. FLOW was measured by iridium strain gauge venous occlusion plethysmography. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased by 4 +/- 5 mm Hg (P <.05) after 6 months of losartan treatment as compared with the point of withdrawal of ACE-i. FLOW decreased by 5.4 +/- 5.0 mL/100 mL tissue/min (P <.001), and HbA (1c) increased by 0.6 +/- 0.8 mmol/L (P <.05). Other metabolic variables, including cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides, were not significantly influenced by the change in therapy. Multiple regression analysis revealed that after adjustment for difference in HbA (1c), the correlation between FLOW and MAP was unchanged, and after adjustment for difference in FLOW, the correlation between HbA (1c) and MAP was no longer significant. Replacement of ACE-i by AII-r in hypertensive patients with type II diabetes mellitus induced a significant increase in HbA (1c) and MAP and a decrease in FLOW. The associations of HbA (1c) and FLOW with MAP were at least partly independent of each other, suggesting that mechanisms other than the bradykinin system (eg, the angiotensin (2) -receptor system) are involved. Our study design did not control for placebo and time effects, and so the data are of a preliminary nature.", 
    "52": "We performed a placebo-controlled trial on the effects of a combined antihypertensive treatment with delapril, a new nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and indapamide, a sulfonamide diuretic. We studied 28 elderly patients aged 65-85 years (mean age, 69 +/- 1 years) who took 30 mg delapril in combination with 1.25 mg indapamide once daily for 24 weeks. In the present study (performed simultaneously with our trial on the effects of delapril/indapamide on left ventricular mass in elderly patients with hypertension and on the same patients), we report the effects of this drug combination on glomerular filtration rate. Sitting arterial pressure (mean +/- SE) decreased from 156 +/- 1. 5/101 +/- 1 mm Hg at baseline to 133 +/- 1/73 +/- 1 mm Hg at the end of the 24-week treatment period (p < 0.0001). No significant changes in heart rate or episodes of orthostatic hypotension were observed. Glomerular filtration rate increased from 91.8 +/- 4.42 mL/min at baseline to 106.3 +/- 4.5 mL/min (p < 0.001) at the end of treatment. Our results show that the combination of delapril and indapamide is effective in the elderly hypertensive patient, with a favorable effect on the prevention of deterioration of kidney function.", 
    "53": "The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of long-term ACE inhibition with ramipril on myocardial hypertrophy and its molecular background in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHR-SP). Therefore, 1-month-old pre-hypertensive SHR-SP were randomized into three groups and exposed lifelong via drinking water to 1 mg/kg/day ramipril (anti-hypertensive dose, RHI), 10 micrograms/kg/day ramipril (non-anti-hypertensive dose, RLO) or placebo. After 15 months cardiac tissue was collected from ten rats each for immunohistochemistry and Northern blot analysis of structural proteins, proteins of the extracellular matrix and several growth factors. Results showed that RHI, but not RLO, treatment prevented development of myocyte hypertrophy (ANP). Furthermore, unlike placebo-treated rats, the ramipril-treated animals had no evidence of degeneration and loss of structural proteins (alpha -actinin), inflammatory infiltrates (CD45) and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (collagen, fibronectin, vimentin). Only in RHI-treated animals, mRNA levels for TGF- beta(1)as well as of collagen alpha(1)(I) and fibronectin were downregulated compared to placebo-treated animals. In contrast, VEGF mRNA levels increased significantly in both groups of ramipril-treated animals v. placebo-treated SHR-SP. Thus, the reported life prolonging effect of high doses of ramipril which is associated with prevention of hypertension and hypertrophy is accompanied by prevention of the development of necrosis and fibrosis. The role of VEGF, however, seems to be independent of this effect.", 
    "54": "Type 2 diabetes is a strong independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, which is responsible for at least 50% of deaths in this disease. After acute myocardial infarction, mortality in diabetic patients is twice that observed in non-diabetic patients. This high mortality is partly related to poor care. Thrombolysis, cardioselective beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are more effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic than non-diabetic patients, and strict glycaemic control can decrease mortality significantly. Secondary prevention by pharmacological and non-pharmacological means is also very effective in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease, although often poorly used by patients and physicians. Diabetic patients with stable angina or silent myocardial ischaemia should be diagnosed early in the course of the disease, if necessary by non-invasive investigation. The diagnosis of coronary heart disease in diabetic patients may lead to modifications in treatment goals and modalities. As the prevalence of diabetic patients with coronary heart disease is increasing, it might be feasible to establish special cardiodiabetic units in which they could benefit from close daily cooperation between diabetologists and cardiologists.", 
    "55": "Poor compliance with antihypertensive therapy is a major cause of unsatisfactory blood pressure control. The doctor has a key role in all steps that lead the patient to adopt a treatment and to take it as prescribed lifelong. Compliance with therapy is a parameter which is difficult to assess. There is often an important mismatch between the subjective views of physicians and patients regarding long-term drug taking. Electronic monitoring of compliance represents a valuable method to evaluate the \"real time\" compliance of the patient. Discussing a compliance recording with a patient may help to identify and solve problems linked with everyday adherence to antihypertensive treatment. Improving compliance is an important task not only for the doctors, but also for all healthcare providers.", 
    "56": "Results from long term trials suggest that first line treatment with the diuretic chlorthalidone is not associated with any adverse effects on quality of life including cognitive performance. Similar findings may be true for other diuretics but there is less evidence. However chlorthalidone and other diuretics do produce erectile problems in around 10% to 15% of middle aged men while the proportion of older men affected is not known. Beta blockers have mixed effects but recent drugs of this class have minor, if any adverse impacts. Calcium channel blockers, especially dihydropyridines, are associated with higher discontinuation rates. ACE inhibitors appear to cause minimal impairment to QoL; they do not interfere with cognitive function or sexual performance and are associated with a low withdrawal rate. Greater control of blood pressure is associated with improved quality of life as are strategies such as weight loss and increased physical exercise.", 
    "57": "Three questions related to cancer and blood pressure are discussed. (i) Is cancer related in some way to hypertension, or to blood pressure? Several studies show a relation of blood pressure and cancer in populations. However, our own experience, based on a cohort of 15,411 subjects with BP measured in the 1970s and with 1,392 fatal cancers since, shows no relation of cancer risk and diastolic pressure. Nor were cancer numbers (n=72) observed in the 1,078 untreated hypertensives of the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic different from those expected (n=71.2) in a control population matched for age, sex and smoking habit. (ii) Do antihypertensive drugs promote cancer? Atenolol and calcium channel blockers have been suspected of this, but evidence of larger studies, including two of our own, is negative: relative risk for cancer in our patients taking CCB was 1.02 (CI 0.82-1.27). (iii) Do antihypertensive drugs protect against cancer? A study of ours based on the Glasgow Clinic raises this possibility: relative risk for incident cancer amongst 1,559 patients taking ACE inhibitor was 0.72 (CI 0.55-0.92).", 
    "58": "Diabetes mellitus and hypertension is often associated, but with a different type of development in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, renal disease, starting with microalbuminuria, is associated with increasing blood pressure or hypertension, whereas the patient without renal disease is most often normotensive. Poor metabolic control is a predictor of microalbuminuria or incipient nephropathy, but with microalbuminuria hypertension is an important risk factor for progression along with poor glycemic control. The same is the case for overt renal disease, and metabolic control is important in all stages of renal disease in type 1 diabetes. It has also been shown that good metabolic control as well as antihypertensive treatment, especially with ACE-inhibitors, often combined with other agents is quite effective in preventing progression in renal disease in all its stages. In type 2 diabetes, blood pressure elevation is often found as early as at the actual diagnosis, and blood pressure significantly increases according to the degree of albuminuria, normo-microalbuminuria and clinical proteinuria (macroalbuminuria). Elevated blood pressure is an important risk for renal disease but more importantly so also for cardiovascular disease. Several studies document that antihypertensive treatment in particular with ACE-inhibitors is important in preventing microalbuminuria, in treating microalbuminuria and thus preventing progression, also in overt renal disease. Near-normalization of blood pressure is vital. Regarding cardiovascular disease, a series of studies now document that antihypertensive treatment with various antihypertensive agents is able to significantly reduce a number of major cardiovascular complications in diabetes, such as cardiac disease, stroke, and also microvacular disease, including retinopathy. Several studies show that antihypertensive treatment should be started at a level higher than 140-150/90. The blood pressure to be achieved during treatment is probably around 140/85 mmHg or even 130/80 mmHg as a pragmatic goal. However, there is no sign of a J-shaped curve in any of the studies, and therefore even lower blood pressure could be advantageous. Even mortality, at least from diabetes-related causes can be effected by antihypertensive treatment. With more advanced renal disease, normalization of blood pressure is increasingly difficult, especially systolic blood pressure, and therefore it is recommendable to screen patients much earlier on with focus on blood pressure recordings and measurements of albuminuria, including microalbuminuria, and to treat early.", 
    "59": "The need for drug combinations in the management of hypertension arises from the fact that the majority of hypertensive patients need at least two drugs to control the blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg. The importance of achieving such goal blood pressures is emphasised by longitudinal studies demonstrating that the achieved blood pressure is the main determinant of outcome and from population surveys in a number of countries that reveal that in general, less than 30% of treated hypertensive patients have blood pressures below 140/90 mmHg. Good combinations of antihypertensive drugs use agents from different classes with different primary actions so that the hypotensive effects are fully additive while side effects are minimised. The particular value of combining drugs for treating hypertension is that it permits the use of low doses, which in turn improves adherence to therapy and control of hypertension. Effective combinations for the treatment of essential hypertension and of systolic hypertension in the elderly are discussed, as are the potential advantages of fixed low dose combinations.", 
    "60": "Over recent years, a number of imidazole derivatives that specifically bind to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor, thereafter called sartans, have been developed and made available to the clinician. Whether targeting antihypertensive treatment with such a high specificity within the renin cascade may carry major clinical advantage over inhibiting angiotensin converting-enzyme remains to be demonstrated. In short-term studies, the efficacy of these drugs at reducing blood pressure was similar to that of established comparators, whereas overall side effect profile was comparable to that of placebo.", 
    "61": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce the risk of death, worsening heart failure and recurrent infarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. They have also been shown to reduce mortality in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. They have been demonstrated to reduce major vascular events and progression of renal disease in diabetes with hypertension, compared to placebo and to calcium channel blockers. Current trials are evaluating their role in preventing major vascular events in patients with coronary artery disease, strokes and Type II diabetes who are normotensive.", 
    "62": "Hypertension is an important risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction may be a key mechanism. The nitric oxide mediated vasodilator function of the endothelium has been widely studied as a test of endothelial integrity in patients with hypertension and impaired basal and muscarinic agonist stimulated components of nitric oxide mediated vascular tone have been found in coronary, forearm and cutaneous resistance vessels and in coronary and forearm conduit vessels. The underlying abnormalities of these changes are unknown but it is likely to be a secondary phenomenon due to increased blood pressure. However, endothelial dysfunction as assessed by response to muscarinic agonists does not occur in all patients and antihypertensive therapy so far has been mostly unable to reverse it. Although widely used the response to acetylcholine has some shortcomings and it remains to be established what parameter best reflects endothelial dysfunction. The relationship of such abnormalities to the present or future atherosclerosis needs to be defined.", 
    "63": "Established in 1968 the Glasgow Blood Pressure Clinic has over 11,000 patients on its computer record. Up to 1980, mortality from all-causes and from cardiovascular causes was high: relative risks compared with two local control populations were greater than 2.0. Since 1980, all-cause mortality has decreased to 1.31 (859 deaths, CI 1.23-1.39). Lower mortality from cardiovascular causes, particularly coronary heart disease, contributes to the decrease. Reasons for the decrease are under investigation currently. Referral of patients with slightly lower blood pressure contributes, as may better blood pressure control with newer antihypertensive drugs. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were introduced in 1980 and during the 16-year period to 1995, all-cause mortality has decreased most in patients taking ACE inhibitor. A decrease also occurred in patients taking antihypertensive drugs other than ACE inhibitor.", 
    "64": "Overviews (meta-analyses) of the major ongoing randomized trials of blood pressure lowering drugs will be conducted to determine the effects of: first, newer versus older classes of blood pressure lowering drugs in patients with hypertension; and second, blood pressure lowering treatments versus untreated or less treated control conditions in patient groups at high risk of cardiovascular events. The principal study outcomes are stroke, coronary heart disease, total cardiovascular events and total cardiovascular deaths. The overviews have been prospectively designed and will be conducted on individual patient data. The analyses will be conducted as a collaboration between the principal investigators of participating trials involving about 270,000 patients. Full data should be available in 2003, with the first round of analyses performed in 1999-2000. The combination of trial results should provide good statistical power to detect even modest differences between the effects on the main study outcomes.", 
    "65": "In 1998 the final results were presented of two large intervention trials in hypertension, the Hypertension Optimal Treatment Study (HOT) and the Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP). Both were initiated from Sweden although the HOT Study was conducted in 26 countries worldwide and the CAPPP Study in Finland and Sweden. The HOT and CAPPP trials and their principal results will be reviewed briefly here. In addition a brief up-date will be provided of three ongoing intervention trials in hypertension that were also initiated from Sweden: the Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension-2 (STOP-Hypertension-), the Nordic Diltiazem (NORDIL) Study and the Study on Cognition and Prognosis in Elderly Hypertensives (SCOPE).", 
    "66": "In 1988, the Systolic Hypertension in China (Syst-China) Collaborative Group started to investigate whether active treatment could reduce the incidence of stroke and other cardiovascular complications of isolated systolic hypertension. After stratification for center, sex and previous cardiovascular complications, alternate patients (n = 1253) were assigned nitrendipine 10-40 mg daily, with the possible addition of captopril 12.5-50.0 mg daily, or hydrochlorothiazide 12.5-50.0 mg daily, or both drugs. In 1141 control patients, matching placebos were employed similarly. At entry, sitting blood pressure averaged 170 mm Hg systolic and 86 mm Hg diastolic, age averaged 66 years, and total serum cholesterol was 5.1 mmol/L. At 2 years, the between-group differences were 9.1 mm Hg systolic (95% confidence interval: 7.6-10.7 mm Hg) and 3.2 mm Hg diastolic (2.4-4.0). Active treatment reduced total stroke by 38% (p=0.01), all-cause mortality by 39% (p=0.003), cardiovascular mortality by 39% (p=0.03), stroke mortality by 58% (p=0.02) and all fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular endpoints by 37% (p=0.004). In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment prevents stroke and other cardiovascular complications in older Chinese patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Treatment of 1000 Chinese patients for 5 years could prevent 55 deaths, 39 strokes, or 59 major cardiovascular endpoints.", 
    "67": "The Syst-Eur study investigated whether active antihypertensive treatment could reduce cardiovascular complications in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Patients (> or = 60 years) were randomly assigned to active treatment (n = 2398), i.e. nitrendipine, with the possible addition of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide, or matching placebos (n= 2297). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the between-group difference in blood pressure amounted to 10.1/4.5 mm Hg (P < 0.001). Active treatment reduced the total incidence of stroke (primary endpoint) by 42% (P = 0.003), of all cardiac endpoints by 26% (P = 0.03), and of all cardiovascular endpoints combined by 31% (P < 0.001). Cardiovascular mortality was slightly lower on active treatment (-27%; P = 0.07), but all-cause mortality was not influenced (-14%; P = 0.22). For total (P = 0.009) and cardiovascular mortality (P = 0.09), the benefit of antihypertensive treatment weakened with advancing age and for total mortality it decreased with higher systolic blood pressure at entry (P = 0.05). The benefits of active treatment were not independently related to gender or to the presence of cardiovascular complications at entry. Further analyses also suggested benefit in patients who were taking nitrendipine as the sole therapy. The per-protocol analysis largely confirmed the intention-to-treat results. It can be concluded that stepwise antihypertensive drug treatment, starting with the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker nitrendipine, improves prognosis in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension.", 
    "68": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors exert a beneficial effect on nephritis. We investigated the effects of KD3-671, an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist (2-propyl-8-oxo-1-[(2'-(H-tetrazole-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]-4,5,6,7-t etrahydro-cycloheptimidazole), on anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-associated nephritis in rats. Untreated nephritic rats had massive proteinuria, glomerular lesions including crescent formation, a significant augmentation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive cells, alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive cells, and the increase in deposition of proteoglycan, fibronectin and desmin in the glomeruli. Administration of KD3-671 to nephritic rats prevented the development of intense proteinuria, glomerular alterations and the increase in plasma urea nitrogen. KD3-671 suppressed the deposition of matrix protein and the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and desmin in the nephritic glomeruli. Captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, suppressed urinary protein excretion and the expression of desmin in the nephritic glomeruli, but not other parameters. These results suggest that KD3-671 may be a useful medicine against glomerulonephritis and glomerulosclerosis.", 
    "69": "Septic shock causes an extensive inflammatory reaction including increased capillary leakage and a decrease in systemic blood pressure. Human septic shock can be replicated in the endotoxaemic pig. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in the degradation of bradykinin, an inflammatory mediator, and in the regulation of blood pressure. Inhibition of ACE is a common approach to reduce hypertension as well as left ventricular insufficiency. Fifteen anaesthetised pigs received a continuous 3 h endotoxin infusion. The animals were randomly given an inhibitor of ACE (enalpril) [at a dose (0.5 mg x kg-1) that did not per se reduce mean arterial blood pressure (MAP); (n = 7)], or the corresponding volume of saline (n = 8). Another seven pigs were randomised for treatment with enalapril (0.5 mg x kg-1) + saline (n = 3). Four pigs were randomised to serve as untreated controls (saline + saline). Basic physiologic variables were registered. Endotoxaemia progressively reduced MAP. This decrease was significantly augmented by enalapril. Hypovolemia caused by increased permeability or salt/water excretion did not seem to explain this effect as neither blood haemoglobin nor plasma sodium differed between the two groups of endotoxaemic pigs. Inhibitors of ACE are known to potentiate the cardio-depressant effect of bradykinin. This may explain the reduction in MAP by enalapril during porcine endotoxaemia.", 
    "70": "Symptoms of hereditary angioedema are intermittent edema of subcutaneous tissues, abdominal organs, upper airways, and brain. Because of spontaneous mutation, in 20% of patients a familial history is lacking. Serological hallmarks are diminished complement factor 4 and C1-esterase inhibitor. The heterogenicity of the clinical symptoms frequently leads to false or delayed diagnosis.", 
    "71": "We report on a 50-year-old male patient with intermittent joint swellings, abdominal complaints, pleural effusions, ascites and headaches with disturbances of consciousness since early adulthood. Diagnosis was systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunosuppressive therapy was ineffective over months. Careful re-evaluation of the patient's clinical history and further laboratory examinations led to the diagnosis of an hereditary angioedema. Anamnestic and laboratory exploration of family members disclosed four other cases. Two of them also were symptomatic for decades without adequate diagnosis.", 
    "72": "In case of intermittent swellings, abdominal complaints, laryngeal edema, pleural effusions or ascites, differential diagnosis should involve hereditary angioedema. With early diagnosis and adequate treatment, prognosis is good. Since ACE inhibitors can aggravate the disease they are contraindicated. Diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment are discussed by reviewing the literature.", 
    "73": "The effect of competing elimination pathways on the metabolic and excretory clearance estimates was examined with tracer concentrations of [(3)H]enalapril, which was both metabolized and excreted by the rat kidney. Perturbation was achieved with use of the carboxylesterase inhibitor paraoxon, which inhibited [(3)H]enalapril metabolism to [(3)H]enalaprilat in rat renal S9 fraction. At 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 10 microM paraoxon, esterolysis of enalapril was inhibited by 76 +/- 7, 93 +/- 5, 96 +/- 5, and 93 +/- 6%, respectively. The lowest concentration (0.1 microM) of paraoxon was chosen for single-pass isolated perfused kidney (IPK) studies because viability was least compromised, and the sodium and glucose reabsorptive functions of the IPK remained constant. After an equilibration period (15-20 min at constant pressure, 90-100 mm Hg), perfusion of the rat kidney with [(3)H]enalapril was carried out under constant flow (8 ml/min) for 30 min in the absence and presence of paraoxon (0.1 microM). The metabolic (from 1.83 +/- 0.52 to 1.48 +/- 0.47 ml/min/g) and total renal (from 1.87 +/- 0.46 to 1. 57 +/- 0.41 ml/min/g) clearances of [(3)H]enalapril in the IPKs were decreased significantly (p <.05) in the presence of paraoxon when compared with controls. Concomitantly, the urinary clearance (from 0. 04 +/- 0.07 to 0.09 +/- 0.09 ml/min/g) and the fractional excretion (from 0.23 +/- 0.18 to 0.52 +/- 0.25) of [(3)H]enalapril doubled (p <.05). The study illustrates that a reduction in cellular metabolism of the kidney brings forth a rise in the estimate of clearance of its complimentary pathway, estimate of the excretory (urinary) clearance.",

    "75": "We investigated the effect of ACE inhibition with trandolapril on the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients with reduced left ventricular function secondary to acute myocardial infarction. The patients in this study were those who qualified for inclusion into the TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study and who had sinus rhythm on the ECG obtained at randomization. Patients who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion were randomized to treatment with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril or placebo and were followed up for 2 to 4 years. Development and time to occurrence of atrial fibrillation in one 12-lead ECG recorded at the outpatient visits was the primary end point of this investigation. Of the 1749 patients included in the TRACE study, 1577 had sinus rhythm on the ECG recorded at randomization. Of these patients, 790 were randomized to trandolapril treatment and 787 to placebo treatment. The groups differed only slightly with respect to baseline characteristics. A total of 64 patients developed atrial fibrillation during the 2- to 4-year follow-up period. Significantly more patients developed atrial fibrillation in the placebo group than in the trandolapril group, 5.3% (n=42) versus 2.8% (n=22), respectively, P<0.05. Cox multivariable regression analysis, adjusting for important baseline characteristics, revealed that trandolapril treatment significantly reduced the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.76; P<0.01).",

    "81": "Relations between ACE gene polymorphism and genetic predisposition to CGN were not found. Patients with genotype II were most sensitive to IACE and cosaar treatment. Lack of an early anti proteinuric response in homozygotes DD does not determine effectiveness of long-term IACE treatment and should not be a reason for the above drug discontinuation.", 
    "82": "In response to humoral and mechanical stimuli, the myocardium adapts to increased work load through hypertrophy of individual muscle cells. Myocardial hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cell size in the absence of cell division and is accompanied by changes in gene expression. Angiotensin II (Ang II), the effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), regulates volume and electrolyte homeostasis and is involved in cardiac and vascular growth in rats. In this review, the role of RAS in myocyte protein synthesis (myocyte hypertrophy) and in induction of gene expression will be discussed in rat cardiomyocytes in culture. Traditional RAS can be considered as a system in which circulating Ang II is delivered to target tissues or cells. However, a local RAS has also been described in cardiac cells and evidence has been accumulated for autocrine and/or paracrine pathways by which biological actions of Ang II can be mediated. These actions of Ang II are primarily mediated through Ang II receptors subtype I (AT1-R). When evaluating the effects of Ang II in situ, both changes in circulating levels and local production have to be taken into account. Contrasting results have been found concerning the in vitro effect of Ang II on the protein synthesis in cardiac myocytes and can be at least partly be attributed to methodological problems such as assay of de novo protein synthesis and isolation and separation procedure of cardiac myocytes. The Ang II-induced hypertrophic effect also depends on the existence of nonmyocytes in a cardiocyte culture. In rat cardiocytes, AngII also causes induction of many immediately-early genes (c-fos, c-jun, jun-B, Egr-1 and c-myc) and induces also late markers of cardiac hypertrophy (skeletal alpha-actin and atrial natriuretic peptide expression) and growth factors (TGF-beta 1 gene expression). In vivo AngII via AT1-R, causes not only ventricular hypertrophy but also a shift to the fetal phenotype of the myocardium. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AngII receptor antagonists of the subtype I not only induce the regression but also prevent the development of cardiac hypertrophy in experimental rat models.", 
    "83": "Previous studies that were based on daytime arterial pressure recordings indicate that lifetime treatment with captopril exacerbates the hypertensive response to a high NaCl diet in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but has no such effect in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The present study used 24-h recording methods to examine the hypothesis that during the normal waking hours of rats (night-time) the hypertensive response to a high NaCl diet is exacerbated in SHR and induced in WKY rats treated with lifetime captopril.", 
    "84": "SHR and WKY rats were (1) untreated, (2), lifetime captopril treated or (3) lifetime captopril treated but removed from the treatment 2 weeks prior to exposure to a high (8%) NaCl diet", 
    "85": "Compared to untreated SHR, in SHR that were continuously treated with captopril, the high NaCl diet caused a more rapid and greater rise in arterial pressure. Discontinuation of the captopril treatment did not significantly diminish this NaCl-sensitivity. In untreated WKY rats, the high NaCl diet did not alter mean arterial pressure, but in the lifetime captopril-treated WKY rats the high NaCl diet induced a rapid rise in arterial pressure. In WKY rats, discontinuation of the lifetime captopril treatment did not diminish this NaCl-induced rise in arterial pressure, even though baseline mean arterial pressure in this group is similar to that in untreated WKY rats.", 
    "86": "Lifetime captopril treatment accelerates the hypertensive response to a high NaCl diet in SHR, and it induces a similar response in WKY rats. In both strains, the lifetime captopril treatment causes a change in the response that is not dependent on concurrent administration of the drug. This finding further suggests that lifetime captopril treatment causes a long-term resetting of cardiovascular response mechanisms.",

Wistar- Kyoto rats (WKY) (n = 8) served as normotensive controls. At 16 weeks of age, angiotensin II (100 pmol) was microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla of anaesthetized rats.", 
    "89": "Blood pressure decreased significantly in the rats treated with either imidapril or TCV-116. Pressor responses to angiotensin II microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla were comparable in the untreated SHR, the imidapril-treated SHR and WKY (12 +/- 2, 15 +/- 4 and 10 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively), but were abolished in SHR treated with TCV-116 (0 +/- 2 mmHg, P< 0.01). Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in the brain stem was significantly lower in SHR treated with imidapril (0.70 +/- 0.06 nmol/mg per h), but significantly higher in SHR treated with TCV-116 (1.62 +/- 0.04 nmol/mg per h) than in the untreated SHR (1.37 +/- 0.05 nmol/mg per h).", 
    "90": "Chronic oral treatment with imidapril and TCV-116 may have divergent influences on the renin-angiotensin system within the brain stem. TCV-116, but not imidapril, abolishes the pressor effect of angiotensin II in the rostral ventrolateral medulla.",

    "96": "Whey peptides in a yogurt-like product fermented by Lactobacillus helveticus CPN4 were fractionated by a Sep-pak C-18 cartridge followed by two-step reverse-phase HPLC. The antihypertensive activity was measured by systolic blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after oral administration of each fraction. Five major peptides in the final fraction were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC and were measured for these antihypertensive activities in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The only peptide in the final fraction that showed strong antihypertensive activity had a sequence of Tyr-Pro, which is found in alpha s1-casein (CN), beta-CN, and kappa-CN. The synthetic peptide Tyr-Pro yielded significant antihypertensive activity from 2 to 8 h after oral administration of 1 mg of peptide/kg of body weight, and the effect was maximal at 6 h after oral administration. The antihypertensive effect of the peptide was dependent on the peptide dosage from 0.1 to 10 mg of peptide/kg of body weight. The concentration of Tyr-Pro peptide increased during fermentation and reached about 8.1 micrograms/ml of whey in the pH 4.3 yogurt-like product. The antihypertensive peptide had a low inhibitory activity against angiotensin I-converting enzyme. The inhibition of 50% of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (IC50) was 720 microM.", 
    "97": "Hypertension in blacks is usually characterized by low renin, expanded volume and sensitivity to salt. Diuretics are the preferred initial therapy, but response to calcium channel antagonists is also good. The blood pressure response to monotherapy with beta blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is blunted, but this effect is abolished with concomitant use of diuretics. The two major types of hypertension in older persons are isolated systolic hypertension and combined systolic and diastolic hypertension. Strong data support the treatment of combined hypertension in patients 60 to 79 years of age and isolated systolic hypertension in patients 60 to 96 years of age. Diuretics and long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists are the recommended initial therapies for isolated systolic hypertension. More studies are necessary before recommendations can be made about the treatment of combined hypertension in patients 80 years of age and older.", 
    "98": "Hospital admissions due to adverse drug reactions are an important concern, but there are few data concerning the specific situation in Switzerland. During one year we therefore prospectively studied all admissions to our medical department to determine the profile. 138 of 2168 patients presented a total of 150 adverse drug reactions at hospitalisation (6.4%) and among them 65% of the admissions were directly related to adverse drug reaction. Age stratification revealed that with each decade of age there was an increasing risk of adverse drug reactions and that the patients were sicker (more diagnoses), were consuming more drugs and had longer stays. The majority of adverse drug reactions were type A reactions and therefore potentially preventable. Cardio- and cerebrovascular drugs (diuretics, ACE-inhibitors, platelet aggregation inhibiting therapy) accounted for 65% of the side effects. Analysed by affected organ system, the most frequent adverse drug reactions were gastrointestinal complications followed by dehydration (contracted extracellular fluid volume) and hypo-/hyperkalaemia. Non-compliance by the patients was less frequently at the origin of the admission than iatrogenic causes related to physician errors. The patients generally did not know the reasons, details and side effects of their medical treatment. Based on our data, we estimate that the national number of drug-related hospital admissions caused by inappropriate or unnecessary treatment is 12,000-16,000, with direct annual extra costs of 70-100 million Swiss francs. Adverse drug reactions therefore represent a serious medical and financial problem. Specialised computing systems designed to reduce these events should be introduced in hospitals and ambulatory care.", 
    "99": "The funny current (I(f)) contributes to phase IV spontaneous depolarization in cardiac pacemaker tissue. Enhanced I(f) activity in myocardial tissue may lead to increased automaticity and therefore tachyarrhythmia. We measured the amount of I(f) activity in the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in human atrial tissue and correlated the mRNA amount to left atrial filling pressure and atrial fibrillation (AF).", 
    "100": "A total of 34 patients undergoing open heart surgery were included (15 men and 19 women, aged 55+/-10 years). Atrial tissue was obtained from the right atrial free wall, the right atrial appendage, the left atrial free wall, and the left atrial appendage, respectively. The mRNA amount of the I(f) channel was measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and was normalized to the mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. We found that the I(f) channel mRNA was present at all the atrial sampling sites. A higher left atrial filling pressure, an indicator of congestive heart failure, was associated with a higher I(f) mRNA level (r2 = 0.446, P < 0.01 by linear regression). We also found that the mRNA amount was significantly higher in patients with AF than in patients without AF (1.68+/-0.49 vs 1.27+/-0.43; P < 0.05). Age, sex, right atrial filling pressure, left atrial dimension, and left ventricular ejection fraction had no significant effect on the mRNA level.",

    "102": "Systemic arterial elastic properties, important determinants of left ventricular function and coronary blood flow, are compromised in myocardial infarction (MI). The cardiac effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) has been extensively studied, whereas their arterial effect has been poorly reported in MI. The aim of this work was to study the effect of prolonged ACEI enalapril treatment on systemic arterial structure and elastic properties in rats with MI. One week after the induction of an MI, 40 male Wistar rats received either no treatment (n = 20) or ACEI enalapril (2 mg/kg; n = 20) for 17 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, blood pressure, cardiac output, total peripheral resistance, systemic arterial compliance, characteristic impedance, and left ventricular power were measured in anesthetized rats. Then the rats were killed for infarct-size determination and aortic histomorphometric study. Infarct size, heart, and left and right ventricular weights were similar in the ACEI-treated and untreated infarcted rats. Prolonged ACEI enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure by 17% (p < 0.001), total peripheral resistance by 22% (p < 0.01), and characteristic impedance by 26% (p < 0.03), and increased systemic arterial compliance by 35% (p < 0.01), in comparison with untreated infarcted rats. Enalapril reduced aortic media wall thickness by 9% (p < 0.02) and increased elastin content by 22% (p < 0.03) and elastin-to-collagen content ratio by 42% (p < 0.01). Enalapril did not affect cardiac output and left ventricular power. Smooth muscle cell nuclei number and size and collagen content of aortic wall were similar in the ACEI-treated and untreated infarcted rats. These results indicate that long-term treatment with ACEI enalapril improves arterial elastic properties through structural modifications of arterial wall in rats with MI. This vascular effect may contribute to improve the left ventricular function and the coronary perfusion of infarcted myocardium, and added to the cardiac effect, may explain the prevention of left ventricular remodeling observed with ACEI in this model.", 
    "103": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinapril and the angiotensin II-receptor antagonist losartan on insulin sensitivity in two types of genetic hypertensive rats with insulin resistance. Quinapril (3 mg/kg) and losartan (10 mg/kg) decreased the systolic blood pressure to almost the same extent in both spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rats. Quinapril increased the glucose requirement for the euglycemic clamp test in both SHRs and Dahl S rats, whereas losartan increased it in SHRs but not in Dahl S rats. The severity of the metabolic abnormalities may be responsible for the failure of losartan to improve the insulin sensitivity in Dahl S rats because serum insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acids (FFAs) were higher in the Dahl S rats than in SHRs. A kinin antagonist, Hoe 140, inhibited the increase in the glucose requirement by quinapril without affecting the depressor effect of quinapril in SHRs. In conclusion, quinapril improved the insulin sensitivity more effectively than did losartan in the genetic hypertensive rats with insulin resistance and relatively severe metabolic abnormalities. Based on our findings, one of the mechanisms underlying the difference between quinapril and losartan may thus be endogenous kinins.", 
    "104": "Cyclosporine A (CsA)-induced hypertension has been shown to be dependent on the level of dietary salt. The present study assessed the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the development of CsA-induced hypertension and nephrotoxicity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) on a high-sodium diet. In addition, we examined whether ACE inhibition prevents the detrimental effects of CsA on blood pressure, kidney function and vascular morphology in SHR on high sodium intake. Eight-week-old SHR were divided into three different groups (n = 8 in each group): (i) SHR control group receiving a high-sodium diet (Na 2.6% of the dry weight of the chow), (ii) CsA group (5 mg/kg s.c.) on a high-sodium diet and (iii) CsA + enalapril group (30 mg/kg p.o.) on a high-sodium diet. At the end of the six-week experimental period, systolic blood pressure in the CsA group was significantly higher compared to the control group (245+/-6 vs 208+/-9 mmHg, respectively, p < 0.05). Plasma renin activity was increased 20-fold by CsA treatment (p < 0.05 compared to controls). CsA increased serum creatinine by 22%, the 24-h urinary protein excretion by 190% and the 24-h urinary excretions of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium by 150%, 25% and 140%, respectively (p < 0.05 compared to controls). Histologically, the kidneys of CsA-treated SHR showed severe thickening of the media of the afferent arteriole and fibrinoid necrosis of the arteriolar wall. Interestingly, CsA induced vascular injury also in the small myocardial arteries. Enalapril treatment prevented CsA-induced hypertension and deterioration of kidney function as well as CsA-induced vascular injuries in the kidneys and myocardium. Enalapril also decreased left ventricular weight-to body weight ratio and prevented CsA-induced increases in urinary calcium and phosphorus excretions. Our findings indicate that CsA has a detrimental effect on blood pressure, kidney function and vascular morphology in SHR on high sodium intake. ACE inhibition prevents the CsA-induced hypertension, nephrotoxicity and vascular injuries. Our findings thus suggest that increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system is involved in the pathogenesis of CsA-induced hypertension and nephrotoxicity in SHR on a high-sodium diet.", 
    "105": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in serum and skeletal muscle to blood pressure and the long-term antihypertensive effects of fosinopril and atenolol. We examined 50 hypertensive patients randomized to receive 20 mg fosinopril or 50 mg atenolol daily for 16 weeks. ACE activity was measured in biopsy specimens from skeletal muscle. Measurements of office and ambulatory blood pressure, serum ACE, and left ventricular wall thickness were also performed. The same investigations were performed in a cross-sectional study of 50 healthy elderly men. Muscle ACE correlated inversely to blood pressure in cross-sectional analyses in both populations (p < 0.05). During atenolol treatment muscle ACE activity tended to increase (14%, p = 0.059), and this increase correlated inversely to the changes in standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.62, p = 0.0044, and r = 0.54, p = 0.016, respectively). Muscle ACE was also inversely correlated to left ventricular wall thickness when the two populations were pooled (r =-0.29, p = 0.0053). In the fosinopril group, muscle ACE activity was not different during treatment than at baseline (-2. 1%, p = 0.68). The inverse relationship between blood pressure and muscle ACE levels in this study indicate that muscle tissue ACE levels are influenced by haemodynamic factors in humans.", 
    "106": "Developing male Sprague-Dawley rats (125 g) with adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) nephrosis (AN) were treated with growth hormone (GH) which may induce hyperfiltration potentiating glomerulosclerosis. Since captopril (CAP) reduces hyperfiltration, we studied its effects in GH-treated rats with AN. After 41, 76, and 90 days of therapy, urine protein excretion was significantly (P<0.05) reduced in GH-treated AN plus CAP compared with AN rats receiving GH alone. After 90 days, urine protein, creatinine ratio was significantly (P<0.05) increased in GH-treated AN (95.2+/-13.9) compared with untreated AN (64.8+/-7.8) and GH-treated AN rats plus CAP (41.8+/-8.8). The mean serum cholesterol level was significantly (P<0.05) reduced in GH-treated AN rats receiving CAP compared with AN rats receiving GH alone and untreated AN controls. Histologically tubular dilation was significantly (P<0.05) reduced in GH-treated AN rats plus CAP compared with AN rats receiving GH alone. Tubular atrophy and scarring were significantly (P<0.05) increased in AN rats treated with GH compared with untreated AN rats, and normalized in GH-treated AN rats plus CAP. We conclude that CAP reduces the proteinuric response of GH in rats with AN and ameliorates tubular injury.", 
    "107": "Lipid abnormalities in renal disease are associated with both a progressive decline in renal function and cardiovascular complications. Whether or not lipid anomalies are causal is not yet clear. Experimental studies have demonstrated that potentially atherogenic lipoproteins, such as low density lipoproteins (LDL), are associated with renal pathophysiological changes that result in progressive glomerular and interstitial damage and an ultimate reduction in renal function. These findings indicate that hyperlipidemia accelerates glomerular and interstitial damage in renal disease. Clinical studies also show that renal function declines more rapidly among patients with primary renal disease or diabetic nephropathy who have hyperlipidemia. However, few reports have demonstrated the effect of hypolipidemic agents on the progression of renal function among patients with renal disease, and those renal patients who were treated with lipid-lowering agents have not been clinically studied under large-scale controlled conditions. In addition, although cardiovascular complications are the most important factors associated with mortality in dialysis patients, randomized, large-scale trials studying the relationship between therapeutic intervention by lipid-lowering agents and prevention of cardiovascular complications have not been implemented.",

Such trials will clarify the effect of treating dyslipidemia on the progression of renal insufficiency and dialysis-related cardiovascular complications.", 
    "111": "Proteinuria is associated with a progressive loss of renal function; we recently found that both intrarenal effects of proteinuria and the state of systemic nephrosis play an independent role in proteinuria-induced renal damage. Reduction of proteinuria is an important mechanism underlying the renoprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi). Both the reduction of proteinuria and the attenuation of the systemic state of nephrosis may be involved in the renoprotection by ACEi.",

It was attempted to modify therapeutic efficacy of ACEi by increasing lisinopril dose and by dietary sodium restriction, respectively. In this analysis, we aimed to delineate the contribution of proteinuria reduction and the reduction of other intermediate parameters such as hyperlipidemia and blood pressure on the protection against focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS).", 
    "113": "We found that in adriamycin nephrosis, ACEi significantly reduced proteinuria, lipids, and blood pressure and provided protection against FGS.

    "115": "A transient significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) from 107 +/- 3 to 98 +/- 3 mmHg (P < 0.05) was observed in elderly (59-69 years of age), healthy volunteers 25-30 min following ingestion of a test meal. In young volunteers (22-34 years of age), a postprandial decrease of MAP from 88 +/- 3 to 83 +/- 4 mmHg was also noted but it was not statistically significant. A 40% decrease in bradykinin (BK) content of circulatory high molecular weight kininogen had previously been observed in human subjects given the same test meal. We presently demonstrate by specific ELISA that the stable pentapeptide metabolite (1-5 BK) of BK increases from 2.5 +/- 1.0 to 11.0 +/- 2.5 pg/ml plasma (P < 0.05) in elderly volunteers and from 2.0 +/- 1.0 to 10.3 +/- 3.2 pg/ml plasma (P < 0.05) in young volunteers 3 h following food intake. This result suggests that ingestion of food stimulates BK release from kininogen in normal man. Postprandial splanchnic vasodilatation, demonstrated by a decrease of plasma half-life of intravenously administered indocyanine green (ICG), a marker of mesenteric blood flow to the liver, from 4.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.0 +/- 0.1 min (P < 0.05) in young volunteers and from 5.2 +/- 1.0 to 4.0 +/- 0.5 min (P < 0.05) in elderly volunteers, accompanied BK release. The participation of BK in this response was investigated in subjects given the BK-potentiating drug captopril prior to food intake. Postprandial decreases of ICG half-lives were not changed by this treatment in either young or elderly subjects, a result which may indicate that BK released following food intake plays no role in postprandial splanchnic vasodilatation in normal man.", 
    "116": "The cerebral blood flow (CBF) is autoregulated to a steady flow within certain ranges. CBF increases and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) decreases dramatically with breakthrough of autoregulation when systemic arterial blood pressure exceeded the upper limit of the range. Many kinds of components in the brain as well neurogenic factors affect the autoregulation. The breakthrough of autoregulation does not occur in the presence of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, prostanoids (PG) administered in the brain, sympathetic denervation, and sinoaortic denervation. The abolishment of breakthrough of autoregulation may be due to an increased tolerance of cerebral vessels to hypertension and the inhibition of the release of a vasodilator substance such as NO or PG. It appears that the tone of brain microvessels is controlled towards dilation by cholinergic innervation originating from the nucleus basalis of Meynert, glutamatergic or GABAergic mediated GABAA receptor, and by a mediator such as NO, bradykinin, PGs. Also, it is likely that candidates for constricting factors in intraparenchymal microvessels are norepinephrinergic from the superior cervical ganglion, serotonergic involved in 5-HT1D beta- and 5-HT2B-specific receptor subtypes, GABAergic mediated GABAB receptor, thromboxane, PG F2 alpha and the angiotensin system. The autoregulation of CBF is maintained by these neurogenic factors to prevent brain ischemia and hyperemia.",

Despite this, there is little evidence that inhibition of endogenous bradykinin breakdown actually contributes to the effects of ACE inhibitors, or indeed, other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin II type I receptor (AT(1)) antagonists, and no evidence at all that it does so in patients with heart failure.",

At the end of each treatment period, forearm blood flow was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography during an intrabrachial infusion of bradykinin before and after an intrabrachial infusion of Hoe-140 (a potent, selective, and long-acting bradykinin antagonist). Bradykinin caused profound vasodilatation after enalapril (peak, 357+/-67%) and less after losartan (peak, 230+/-46%). Despite this, Hoe-140 had no discernible effects after enalapril or losartan. Similarly, this was despite the finding that Hoe-140 significantly reduced vasodilatation to bradykinin after enalapril (peak, 192+/-35%) and losartan (peak, 66+/-13%).",

    "120": "Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular eubacteria that is dependent on a eukaryotic host cell for a variety of metabolites. For years, it has been speculated that chlamydiae are energy parasites, totally dependent on their host cell for ATP and other high-energy intermediates. To determine whether C. trachomatis contains functional enzymes that produce energy or reducing power, four enzymes involved in glycolysis or the pentose phosphate pathway, specifically pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, were cloned, sequenced and expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences obtained show high homology to other pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymes. In contrast to numerous other bacterial species, chlamydial glycolytic genes are not arranged in an operon, but are dispersed throughout the genome. Results from reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicate that all four genes are maximally expressed in the middle of the chlamydial developmental cycle. The chlamydial genes are capable of complementing mutant E. coli strains lacking the respective enzyme activities. In vitro enzyme analysis indicates that recombinant chlamydial enzymes expressed in E. coli are active and, interestingly, recombinant chlamydial pyruvate kinase is not regulated allosterically by fructose 1,6 bisphosphate or AMP, as found with other bacterial pyruvate kinases. In summary, identification and characterization of these glucose-catabolizing enzymes indicate that chlamydia contains the functional capacity to produce its own ATP and reducing power.", 
    "121": "The hypertensive transgenic rat model TGR(mRen2)27 has been used to investigate the development of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy in response to two different drug regimes. Cardiac hypertrophy was shown to be related to age and gender with the copy number of mouse renin transgenes having an additive effect. A similar observation was noted for hypertrophy in the vasculature, which was assessed using flow cytometry cell cycle DNA analysis of aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. Chronic treatment from weaning with equihypotensive doses of perindopril (2 mg/kg/day) or hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide (4 mg/day of each) prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Perindopril treatment also effectively prevented the development of vascular hypertrophy; however, treatment with hydralazine and hydrochlorothiazide was not as effective despite equivalent blood pressure reduction. These studies have demonstrated the presence of marked vascular and cardiac hypertrophy in the hypertensive transgenic TGR(mRen2)27 model of hypertension. Furthermore, these results provide new evidence to support the role of a locally activated renin angiotensin system in the blood vessel wall, which is involved in the pathogenesis of vascular hypertrophy in this transgenic rat model.",

Changes in the diameter of distal arterioles in response to topical application of iloprost, forskolin, cholera toxin, acetylcholine, and nitroprusside were measured with a video micrometer. Arteriolar responses to each of the vasodilator agonists used in this study were significantly reduced in the captopril-treated rats, relative to the untreated controls. The maximum dilation of the arterioles, determined during superfusion with Ca2+-free physiologic salt solution containing 10(-4) mol/L adenosine, was also reduced in the captopril-treated rats, suggesting structural remodeling of the arteriolar wall. These observations indicate that chronic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with captopril leads to significant alterations in arteriolar structure and reactivity, and that angiotensin II may play a protective role in maintaining normal vascular structure and vasodilator reactivity in the microcirculation.", 
    "123": "To compare two popular strategies for intensifying treatment for hypertension, a double-blind, randomized, prospective, parallel-group, and partial crossover study was done. After 2 weeks of placebo run-in (baseline) and 3 weeks of 5 mg enalapril once daily, 217 patients were randomized to 6 weeks of treatment with either a low-dose combination therapy (5 mg enalapril + 5 mg felodipine ER once daily, Lexxel, Astra Merck, Inc.), or a higher dose of monotherapy (10 mg enalapril once daily, Vasotec, Merck & Co., Inc.). The group randomized to the combination had significantly greater reductions in sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure (BP)--14.2/10.6 mm Hg compared with baseline versus 9.6/7.4 mm Hg (P < .05/.01)--as well as a greater percentage of patients having achieved either diastolic BP < 90 mm Hg or a decline of at least 10 mm Hg (responders), 59% v 41% (P < .01). When patients originally taking 10 mg enalapril were crossed over to the combination therapy for a further 6 weeks, there was a further BP reduction and increase in response rate, with loss of significant differences compared with those treated continuously with the combination for the entire 12 weeks. The greater BP-lowering efficacy of the combination was independent of age, gender, and race. There were no significant differences in tolerability between the regimens. These data support the hypothesis that in patients who do not achieve goal BP reduction with a low dose of an antihypertensive agent, a combination of two drugs with complementary mechanisms of action is more effective than increasing the dose of the first agent.", 
    "124": "We measured the serum lipid profile, together with plasma fibrinogen and serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), glucose, bilirubin, and albumin levels in 491 patients (310 men) who were referred for the management of primary dyslipidemia. All these variables have been shown to predict vascular events. The patients were not taking lipid-lowering drugs; hypertension was present in 156 (31.7%) of them. Of the hypertensive patients, 52 (33%) were not receiving any treatment to control their blood pressure. This omission was not due to a lower prevalence of established vascular disease. The treated hypertensives were divided into three groups according to their treatment: 62 were taking lipid-hostile antihypertensives (beta-blockers, thiazides), 37 were taking lipid-neutral antihypertensives (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, Ca-channel blockers, angiotensin II receptor blockers, indapamide sustained release), and five were taking lipid-friendly antihypertensives (doxazosin). Lipid-hostile antihypertensive drugs were associated with a significantly higher fibrinogen concentration when compared with untreated hypertensives or those taking lipid-neutral/lipid-friendly drugs (median values: 383, 353, and 336 mg/dL, respectively; P < .01). Lipid-neutral/lipid-friendly antihypertensive drugs were associated with lower Lp(a) levels when compared with untreated hypertensives (median values: 22 and 45 mg/dL, respectively; P < .05). The serum bilirubin level was significantly lower in the untreated hypertensives when compared with normotensives or the treated hypertensives. There were no significant differences in lipids, glucose, or albumin among the groups of hypertensives or normotensives. The influence of antihypertensive drugs on additional cardiovascular risk factors should be considered when selecting medication to reduce blood pressure.", 
    "125": "A positive history of arterial hypertension (HBP) is present in as many as 30% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and their clinical outcome could be greatly improved by drugs enhancing blood pressure control and preserving ventricular function. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the importance of a history of HBP on the clinical efficacy of early treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor zofenopril in patients with anterior AMI. We summarize the results of a post-hoc analysis of data from the Survival of Myocardial Infarction Long-term Evaluation (SMILE) study, which randomly evaluated the efficacy of zofenopril given within 24 h of symptom onset to patients with anterior AMI not undergoing thrombolysis. Of 1441 patients who entered the study, 565 (39.2%) had a history of HBP. The mean follow-up time was 12 months and the main outcome measures were 6-week combined occurrence of death and severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and 1-year mortality. After 6-week of treatment with zofenopril the relative risk of death or severe CHF was 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.81; 2P < .05) in the hypertensive group and 0.89 (0.74-1.08; 2P = .62) for normotensive patients, whereas the 1-year risk of death was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.23,0.89; 2P < .05) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.52-1.17; 2P = .22), respectively. The 6-week prevalence of mild-to-moderate CHF was also significantly reduced by zofenopril in the hypertensive population (14.1% v 9.4%; 2P < .05). The present data suggest that treatment with zofenopril started within 24 h of the onset of anterior AMI could be highly beneficial in patients with a history of HBP.", 
    "126": "In view of the internal counter-regulation mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), complete blockade would not seem to be possible if only one of its components is targeted. Instead of increasing the dosage of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or that of an angiotensin II antagonist (AA), blockade of the system at two different levels by neutralising the internal counter-regulation mechanism could provide more effective blockade and, therefore, more pronounced biological effects. For this reason, the authors undertook two studies in a model of mild salt depletion of a normotensive subject, which showed additive effects on the lowering of the blood pressure and renin secretion during combined administration of captopril and losartan, then enalapril and losartan. There was no additive effect on plasma aldosterone levels. The administration of the ACE inhibitor neutralised the expected increases in plasma Angiotensin II values due to the losartan. All combinations of ACE inhibitor and AA were tested in spontaneous hypertensive rats using a dosage scale from 1 to 30, the results of which showed the beneficial effects of combined blockade on left ventricular mass and the deleterious effects on renal function when blockade of the RAS is too complete. Based on the results obtained in normotensive subjects and homogeneous groups of hypertensive animals, the authors conclude that low doses of an AA and of an ACE inhibitor is more effective in lowering the blood pressure than higher doses of each drug administered separately. How can these results be applied clinically in hypertension and cardiac failure? The choice between increasing the dose of each of the two drugs or the association of low doses of both drugs will depend more on the tolerance of each therapeutic strategy than on the efficacy. The choice between the two strategies will also depend on the demonstration of consequences specific to each modality of inhibition of the system, especially with respect to the effects of accumulation of bradykinin and to stimulation of type 2 receptors. The additive effects of a combined treatment should be validated by repeated administration in hypertensive patients.", 
    "127": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are associated with a greater reduction in mortality in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy than in ischaemic cardiomyopathy after the results of the V-HeFT-II and SOLVD trials in symptomatic patients. However, a recent analysis of the global, symptomatic and therapeutic, results of the SOLVD trials, demonstrated a similar reduction in mortality with ACE inhibitors in ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies. Moreover, after myocardial infarction, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors have been well established in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Betablockers, especially bisoprolol in the CIBIS-I trial, also seem to be more effective in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. However, CIBIS-II and the US Carvedilol Heart Failure Trial Program clearly showed that the benefits of betablockade were identical whether ischaemic or not. The beneficial effects of betablockers in the post-infarction period are more marked when left ventricular dysfunction is severe. The PROVED and RADIANCE trials suggest that digitalis is more effective in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. These results were not confirmed by the DIG trial which showed a significant reduction in the combined criterion, mortality and hospital admission for aggravation of cardiac failure, both in ischaemic and in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. However, the use of digitalis should be prudent during ischaemic cardiomyopathy, the neutral effect on global mortality in the DIG trial masking divergent results with a tendency to reducing mortality due to aggravation of cardiac failure and a significant increase of other causes of cardiac death, especially from myocardial infarction and arrhythmias. Amiodarone could also be useful in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The reduction in risk of death in the GESICA study, which comprised 60% of patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, contrasting with the absence of an effect with this molecule in the STAT-CHF trial which only comprised 29% of patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The new generation of calcium antagonists could also be more effective in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Although amlodipine significantly reduced mortality in the PRAISE trial in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, there was no favourable effect with felodipine in the V-HeFT-III tria. Finally, if in the earlier studies oral anticoagulants were more effective in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy, the recent results of the SOLVD trial showed that warfarin decreased the mortality in both ischaemic and non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy. The value of anti-aggregant therapy is not questioned in coronary artery disease, but its role in dilated cardiomyopathy has not yet been established. In conclusion, apart from the use of digitalis which must be prudent in post-infarction cardiomyopathy or in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, the treatment of cardiac failure differs little with respect to its ischaemic or non-ischaemic aetiology, and should be based on the NYHA (New York Heart Association) classification.", 
    "128": "Some aspects of vascular reactivity are altered in mild experimental uraemia, as shown by increased myogenic tone and a reduced lumen diameter in the femoral artery. This study was conducted to investigate the prevention of these uraemia-induced vascular abnormalities by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) Ramipril. Ten male Wistar rats were rendered uraemic (U) by 5/6th nephrectomy, and 10 control (C) rats were concurrently sham-operated. After 4 weeks, both groups were given daily subcutaneous injections of 3 microg of Ramipril for a further 4 weeks. Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure was then recorded and the rat was killed. Isolated femoral arteries were mounted on a pressure myograph and pressurized at 40 mmHg for baseline measurements of the lumen internal diameter. Myogenic tone was then assessed over a range of intravascular pressures from 40 to 160 mmHg. Biochemically, serum urea and creatinine were significantly higher in the uraemic (U) group [urea: U, 23+/-3 mmol/l; C, 6+/-1 mmol/l (P<0.001); creatinine: U, 147+/-17 mmol/l, C, 72+/-11 mmol/l (P<0.01)]. Systolic blood pressure was the same in both groups (U, 127+/-7 mmHg; C, 127+/-3 mmHg). The mean baseline internal diameter was the same in both groups (U, 756+/-22 microm; C, 721+/-34 microm, not significant), as was mean myogenic tone (U, 4.7+/-1%; C, 3.4+/-1%). In conclusion, there were no differences in baseline lumen diameter or myogenic tone in uraemic compared with control femoral arteries of rats treated with Ramipril, which suggests that Ramipril may prevent the development of elevated myogenic tone and decreased lumen diameter previously observed in this model of uraemia. These results suggest that these specific vascular abnormalities in uraemia may be mediated by renin or bradykinin, or by the direct action of angiotensin II on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "129": "Endothelial vasomotor function is impaired in a variety of disorders representing both early and late stages of atherosclerosis. There is experimental evidence for enhanced vascular angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in these disorders. We explored whether enhanced vascular ACE activity accounts for endothelial dysfunction in experimental hypertension. Hypertension was induced in rats by coarctation of the aorta. At 2 weeks post-operation, the animals were randomly divided into groups receiving the ACE inhibitor quinapril (2.0 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), the angiotensin type-1 receptor antagonist losartan (3.0 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), the B(2) kinin receptor antagonist icatibant (0.4 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), quinapril plus icatibant, losartan plus icatibant, or no drug. Analyses were performed 4 weeks post-operation. None of the drug treatments had any significant effect on blood pressure. ACE activity was nearly doubled in aortae from untreated hypertensive rats as compared with sham-operated rats. Quinapril reduced ACE activity in aortae from hypertensive rats by 75%, losartan caused a 40% decrease, and icatibant had no effect. Endothelium-dependent, nitric oxide-mediated vasodilator responses studied in vitro were impaired by 40% in aortae from untreated hypertensive rats as compared with sham-operated rats. Both quinapril and losartan restored endothelial vasomotor function in aortae from hypertensive rats. Co-applied icatibant negated the effects of quinapril, but not those of losartan. The level of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) mRNA determined by competitive RNA PCR was decreased by half in aortae from untreated hypertensive rats as compared with sham-operated rats. Quinapril induced an increase in the eNOS mRNA level of 350% in aortae from hypertensive rats, which was negated by co-applied icatibant. Losartan restored eNOS mRNA expression in aortae from hypertensive rats to normal levels, and this effect was not modified by co-applied icatibant. These findings suggest that enhanced vascular ACE activity accounts for endothelial vasomotor dysfunction by impairing the bioavailability of endothelium-derived NO. Both enhanced formation of angiotensin II and enhanced metabolism of bradykinin might account for a vascular deficiency of bioactive NO.", 
    "130": "Acute administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril enhances insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in skeletal muscle of the insulin-resistant obese Zucker rat. The present study was designed to assess whether this effect is mediated by an increase in the nonapeptide bradykinin (BK), by a decrease in action of ANG II, or both. Obese Zucker rats (8-9 wk old) were treated for 2 h with either captopril (50 mg/kg orally), bradykinin (200 micrograms/kg ip), or the ANG II receptor (AT(1) subtype) antagonist eprosartan (20 mg/kg orally). Captopril treatment enhanced in vitro insulin-stimulated (2 mU/ml) 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the epitrochlearis muscle by 22% (251 +/- 7 vs. 205 +/- 9 pmol. mg(-1). 20 min(-1); P < 0.05), whereas BK treatment enhanced this variable by 18% (249 +/- 15 vs. 215 +/- 7 pmol. mg(-1). 20 min(-1); P < 0.05). Eprosartan did not significantly modify insulin action. The BK-mediated increase in insulin action was completely abolished by pretreatment with either the specific BK-B(2) receptor antagonist HOE 140 (200 micrograms/kg ip) or the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (50 mg/kg ip). Collectively, these results indicate that the modulation of insulin action by BK likely underlies the metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors in the insulin-resistant obese Zucker rat. Moreover, this modulation of insulin action by BK is likely mediated through B(2) receptors and by an increase in nitric oxide production and/or action in skeletal muscle tissue.", 
    "131": "We examined the role of the subfornical organ (SFO) in stimulating thirst and salt appetite using two procedures that initiate water and sodium ingestion within 1-2 h of extracellular fluid depletion. The first procedure used injections of a diuretic (furosemide, 10 mg/kg sc) and a vasodilator (minoxidil, 1-3 mg/kg ia) to produce hypotension concurrently with hypovolemia. The resulting water and sodium intakes were inhibited by intravenous administration of ANG II receptor antagonist (sarthran, 8 micrograms . kg(-1). min(-1)) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril, 2.5 mg/h). The second procedure used injections of furosemide (10 mg/kg sc) and a low dose of captopril (5 mg/kg sc) to initiate water and sodium ingestion upon formation of ANG II in the brain. Electrolytic lesions of the SFO greatly reduced the water intakes, and nearly abolished the sodium intakes, produced by these relatively acute treatments. These results contrast with earlier findings showing little effect of SFO lesions on sodium ingestion after longer-term extracellular fluid depletion.", 
    "132": "We have examined the changes in quantity and activity of cardiac sarcolemmal (SL) phosphoinositide-phospholipase C (PLC)-beta(1), -gamma(1), and -delta(1) in a model of congestive heart failure (CHF) secondary to large transmural myocardial infarction (MI). We also instituted a late in vivo monotherapy with imidapril, an ANG-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, to test the hypothesis that its therapeutic action is associated with the functional correction of PLC isoenzymes. SL membranes were purified from the surviving left ventricle of rats in a moderate stage of CHF at 8 wk after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. SL PLC isoenzymes were examined in terms of protein mass and hydrolytic activity. CHF resulted in a striking reduction (to 6-17% of controls) of the mass and activity of gamma(1)- and delta(1)-isoforms in combination with a significant increase of both PLC beta(1) parameters. In vivo treatment with imidapril (1 mg/kg body wt, daily, initiated 4 wk after coronary occlusion) improved the contractile function and induced a partial correction of PLCs. The mass of SL phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the activities of the enzymes responsible for its synthesis were significantly reduced in post-MI CHF and partially corrected by imidapril. The results indicate that profound changes in the profile of heart SL PLC-beta(1), -gamma(1), and -delta(1) occur in CHF, which could alter the complex second messenger responses of these isoforms, whereas their partial correction by imidapril may be related to the mechanism of action of this ACE inhibitor.", 
    "133": "The effects of a new angiotensin receptor antagonist, eprosartan (200 or 300 mg b.i.d.) and enalapril (5-20 mg u.i.d.) on cough and blood pressure were compared in a 26-week, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, multicentre, international study involving 528 patients with hypertension. Uptitration of doses was based on clinic blood pressure measurements during the first 12 weeks, after which hydrochlorothiazide (12.5-25 mg/day) could be added. The frequency and intensity of cough was assessed by a standardised questionnaire administered at each clinic visit. The primary end-point was the incidence of persistent, dry cough not due to upper respiratory infection; change in sitting diastolic blood pressure and overall incidence of cough were secondary end-points. During the first 12 weeks of double-blind therapy, enalapril treatment was associated with a 3.45-fold higher risk of definite cough (14/261 vs 4/259, P = 0.018). Overall cough incidence (from spontaneous reports from patients, or investigator's observation) was also more frequent with enalapril, as compared to eprosartan. Both agents reduced blood pressure significantly compared to baseline, although the eprosartan-treated group had a slightly higher response rate (defined as sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, or at least a 10 mm Hg reduction from baseline), both at end of titration (70.3% vs 62.6%, P < 0.05) and after 26 weeks (81.7% vs 73.5%, P= 0.018). These data suggest that, in unselected hypertensive patients, eprosartan is associated with less cough and a somewhat higher responder rate than enalapril.", 
    "134": "In 34 out-patients with essential hypertension, the antihypertensive effect and the trough-to-peak ratios of once-daily enalapril or lisinopril were compared by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) according to a crossover design. The drug dose was titrated and a thiazide diuretic was added if necessary to attain a target office BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg. Both drugs significantly lowered BP but the effect of lisinopril was greater (P < 0.009): day- and night-time mean BP fell from 152/98 and 135/84 mm Hg, respectively to 133/85 and 118/74 mm Hg with enalapril and to 129/83 and 116/70 mm Hg with lisinopril. BP goal was reached with an average dose of 18 mg enalapril with 8 mg hydrochlorothiazide and with 17 mg lisinopril combined with 6 mg diuretic. Trough:peak ratio values, which were calculated after Fourier analysis of ABPM data in individual patients, were independent of drug dose. The combination with the diuretic resulted in slightly higher trough:peak ratios than with ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but the difference was not significant. The median trough:peak ratio in patients when using enalapril-based therapy was 0.48 and, when taking lisinopril-based treatment, it was 0.65 (n = 28, P < 0.005). A significant correlation was found between trough:peak ratio and changes in daytime mean arterial pressure (MAP; Spearman r= 0.43) and night-time MAP (r= 0.66). When 24-h ABPM was performed starting 24 h after last drug intake, both ACE inhibitors still had a significant antihypertensive effect (P < 0.001), which was similar for both drugs. Eleven patients reported minor side effects. Four patients stopped ACE-inhibitor treatment because of cough. The data show that lisinopril has a longer duration of action than enalapril.", 
    "135": "We examined the hypotensive effect of enalapril in relation to the local renin-angiotensin system of the kidney in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Oral administration of enalapril for 7 days decreased mean arterial blood pressure and renal tissue angiotensin II concentration without affecting plasma angiotensin II concentration in SHR. The enalapril treatment did not affect maximum binding of angiotensin II to renal tubules and glomeruli in SHR. In normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats, no significant changes in mean arterial blood pressure, renal and plasma angiotensin levels were observed with enalapril treatment. Direct infusion of enalapril into the renal medullary interstitium decreased mean arterial blood pressure in association with the reduction of renal tissue angiotensin II concentration without changes in plasma angiotensin II concentration in SHR. These observations suggest that the inhibition of angiotensin conversion in the kidney is important for the hypotensive action of enalapril.", 
    "136": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been demonstrated to protect spontaneously hypertensive rats from cerebral ischemia. The present study investigated the protective effect of enalapril and moexipril in models of permanent focal cerebral ischemia in normotensive mice and rats. To elucidate the mechanism of neuroprotection the influence of these angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on glutamate-, staurosporine- or Fe2+/3+-induced generation of reactive oxygen species and neuronal cell death in primary cultures from chick embryo telencephalons was studied. Treatment with moexipril or enalapril dose-dependently reduced the percentage of damaged neurons, as well as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation induced by glutamate, staurosporine or Fe2+/3+. Furthermore, moexipril and enalapril attenuated staurosporine-induced neuronal apoptosis as determined by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. In mice, 1 h pretreatment with enalapril (0.03 mg/kg) or moexipril (0.3 mg/kg) significantly reduced brain damage after focal ischemia as compared to control animals. Additionally, moexipril (0.01 mg/kg) was able to reduce the infarct volume in the rat model after focal cerebral ischemia. The results of the present study indicate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors enalapril and moexipril promote neuronal survival due to radical scavenging properties.", 
    "137": "There is sparse data on the treatment practices being followed for acute myocardial infarction at various hospitals that differ in their financial infrastructure, availability of facilities and attachment to a medical college. In this prospective observational study, we evaluated the treatment practices for acute myocardial infarction, its appropriateness based on ACC/AHA guidelines and possible influence by type of hospital and certain patient characteristics. Thrombolysis, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme-I inhibitors were used in 674 (63%), 506 (47%) and 413 (38%) respectively of 1072 patients. However, when evaluated according to ACC/AHA guidelines, appropriate use was noted in 83 percent, 78 percent and 99.3 percent, respectively. Thrombolysis was inappropriately denied to 14.7 percent patients whereas in 2.4 percent it was used contrary to recommendations. The most common reason for ineligibility for thrombolysis was late arrival. Beta-blockers were denied to 25.1 percent patients. Decision on use of angiotensin-converting enzyme-I was appropriate in most patients. Aspirin was used in 1027 (95.8%) patients. Government hospitals were least likely to thrombolyse a patient as compared to private, industrial and voluntary hospitals; however, this difference was not seen with the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme-I. Hospitals attached to medical colleges follow guidelines for use of thrombolysis and beta-blockers more closely than non-teaching hospitals. To conclude, evaluation of appropriateness of a therapeutic modality is of greater clinical significance than mere absolute use. Benefits of thrombolytic therapy can be extended by minimising pre-hospital delay; and there is scope for improved utility of beta-blockers which are cost-effective. In addition, the hospital type also has an impact on the treatment practice being followed for acute myocardial infarction.",

    "139": "A 69 year old man is described with a 12 year history of intermittent syncope associated with ingesting solid food, mainly after having fasted. He was taking enalapril, propranolol, bendrofluazide (bendroflumethiazide), omeprazole, finasteride, and aspirin. Detailed investigations, including gastrointestinal evaluation, measurement of various gut hormones, and autonomic testing, indicated no abnormality. A liquid meal, performed before fasting, failed to elicit an episode. However, a solid meal after an overnight fast provoked near-syncope. Continuous non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring (with a Portapres II) indicated a short lived rise in blood pressure and heart rate, followed by severe hypotension, a fall in stroke volume and cardiac output, and then bradycardia. This favoured an initial increase in sympathetic activity, followed by vasodepression due to sympathetic withdrawal or activation of humoral vasodilatatory mechanisms, with bradycardia secondary to impaired cardiac filling. Withdrawal of enalapril abolished the episodes. The unusual nature of this case, in which haemodynamic recordings continuously were made during and after swallow syncope, induced soon after food ingestion, is discussed.", 
    "140": "It has been proposed that the macula densa participates in the regulation of increased renin expression in renovascular hypertension (RVH) and that prostaglandins may be among the mediators of macula densa function. We have previously shown that in renal cortex, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is localized to the macula densa and surrounding cortical thick ascending limb and increases in high-renin states, such as salt restriction and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. In the present studies, we examined the effect of the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC58236 on plasma renin activity (PRA) and renal renin expression in RVH in rats. The aorta was coarcted between right and left renal arteries, and animals received either SC58236 or vehicle for 1 week. At day 8, vehicle-treated coarcted rats were hypertensive (mean carotid arterial blood pressure: 138+/-3 versus 87+/-2 mm Hg in sham-operated controls; n=9 to 11; P<0.001) and exhibited a disparity of kidney size (ratio left/right kidney: 0.78+/-0.04 versus 1.02+/-0.02; n=9 to 10; P<0.001). PRA increased significantly (84.6+/-6.5 versus 9.0+/-1.4 ng angiotensin I [Ang I] per milliliter per hour; n=8 to 9; P<0.01). In the coarcted rats, neither renin mRNA expression nor renin activity of the right kidney was altered (renin/GAPDH mRNA: 1.12+/-0.05-fold levels in control rats; n=6; P=NS; renin activity: 23.4+/-1.8 versus 27.1+/-3.4 ng Ang I per hour per milligram protein; n=8 to 9; P=NS). However, the renin mRNA of the left kidney increased to 3.0+/-0.6-fold of control (n=6), and the renin activity increased to 189.0+/-28.6 ng Ang I per hour per milligram protein (n=8; P<0.01). Expression of COX-2 mRNA and immunoreactive protein increased in the affected left kidney but was not different from control in the unaffected right kidney. SC58236 treatment to coarcted rats did not affect kidney size (ratio left/right kidney: 0.79+/-0.06; n=9). However, PRA was significantly decreased compared with the vehicle-treated coarcted rats (19.8+/-2. 8 ng Ang I per milliliter per hour; n=9; P<0.01). The left kidney renin mRNA and renin content were also decreased (1.7+/-0.3-fold control; n=6; P<0.05; and 45.7+/-7.6 ng Ang I per hour per milligram protein; n=9; P<0.01, respectively), while renin mRNA and renin content of the right kidney were not altered. SC58236 lowered mean arterial blood pressure (122+/-5 mm Hg; n=14; P<0.05 compared with vehicle). A significant correlation was observed between PRA and mean blood pressure (r=0.75; P<0.01). In summary, these studies indicate that the selective COX-2 inhibitor SC58236 decreases renin production and release in RVH and suggest an important role for COX-2 regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "141": "To shed light on mechanisms of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) upregulation, we used a rabbit endothelial cell model to characterize intracellular pathways of beta-adrenergic stimulation. In these cells, ACE activity is increased by isoproterenol (ISO). The stably transfected 1273-bp ACE promoter is stimulated by ISO in the presence of isobutyl methylxanthine. This effect is abolished by propranolol. Promoter stimulation is mimicked by cholera toxin, forskolin, and 8BrcAMP, but not by 8BrcGMP. Promoter stimulation by ISO and isobutyl methylxanthine is blocked by protein kinase A inhibitors, indicating that beta-adrenergic stimulation of the ACE gene depends on phosphorylation of protein kinase A targets. Activation by cAMP, resistance to phorbol ester, and lack of synergism between cAMP and phorbol ester suggest that promoter regulation is due to cAMP responsive element rather than to activating protein-2 sequences. Okadaic acid potentiation of 8BrcAMP induction indicated that promoter activation by cAMP is regulated by phosphatases controlling activation of typical cAMP responsive element regulated genes. In summary, beta-adrenergic activation of rat ACE promoter is specific; uses G(s) proteins, adenylyl cyclase, protein kinase A; and probably includes cAMP responsive element-like sequences.", 
    "142": "We tested the hypothesis that nitric oxide (NO) released by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) is not only important in blood pressure regulation but also involved in cardiac function and remodeling and in the cardioprotective effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). With the use of a 2D Doppler echocardiography system equipped with a 15-MHz linear transducer, we evaluated left ventricular (LV) morphology and function in conscious eNOS knockout mice (eNOS(-/-); n=15) and their wild-type littermates (eNOS(+/+); n=16). We also studied whether in eNOS(-/-) mice (1) myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury is more severe and (2) the cardioprotective effect of ACEi is diminished or absent. In comparison with the wild type, eNOS(-/-) mice had significantly increased systolic blood pressure (128+/-3 versus 108+/-5 mm Hg; P<0.001) and decreased heart rate (531+/-22 versus 629+/-18 bpm; P<0.001) associated with increased LV posterior wall thickness (0.80+/-0.04 versus 0.64+/-0.02 mm; P<0.001) and LV mass (18.3+/-0.9 versus 13.1+/-0.5 mg/10 g body weight; P<0.01). Despite hypertension and LV hypertrophy, LV chamber dimension, shortening fraction and ejection fraction (indicators of LV contractility), and cardiac output did not differ between the 2 strains, which indicates that LV function in eNOS(-/-) mice is well compensated. We also found that in eNOS(+/+) mice, ACEi decreased the ratio of myocardial infarct size to area at risk from 62.7+/-3.9% to 36.3+/-1.6% (P<0. 001), whereas in eNOS(-/-) mice this effect of ACEi was almost abolished: the ratio of myocardial infarct size to area at risk was 67.2+/-2.9% in the vehicle-treated group and 62.7+/-3.9% in mice treated with ACEi. Moreover, infarct size in vehicle-treated eNOS(-/-) mice was not significantly different from eNOS(+/+) mice given the same treatment. We concluded that (1) endothelium-derived NO plays an important role in the regulation of blood pressure homeostasis; (2) NO released under basal conditions has no significant impact on cardiac function; and (3) ACEi protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury in mice and that this effect is mediated in part by endothelium-derived NO.", 
    "143": "The survival benefit from the use of inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in patients with acute myocardial infarction is usually presented in terms of risk ratios and lives saved per 1000 people treated. A more relevant way to present the extent of benefit would be in terms of an increase in life expectancy, but this approach has not previously been possible because of limited data on long-term outcome. We aimed to calculate the effect of trandolapril on life expectancy with follow-up data from the Trandolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) Study.", 
    "144": "The TRACE study previously showed a significant survival benefit with trandolapril in patients with reduced left-ventricular function after an acute myocardial infarction who were treated for at least 2 years. We ascertained the survival status of all patients in the TRACE study in June, 1998, at which time they had been followed up for a minimum of 6 years. We estimated life expectancy as median lifetime, which was the time for 50% of the patients to have died. Change in life expectancy is expressed as change in median lifetime. Analysis was by intention to treat.", 
    "145": "The life expectancy of patients was 4.6 years for those given placebo versus 6.2 years for those on trandolapril. Thus, for patients on trandolapril, median lifetime was increased by 15.3 months or 27% (95% CI 7 to 51). Analysis of follow-up after the end of the study indicated no decrease of this benefit during the course of double-blind treatment; continued use of trandolapril was recommended at study closure.",

    "147": "1. Bradykinin inhibits hypertrophy of rat ventricular myocytes, but only in the presence of endothelial cells. 2. The influence of hyperglycaemia on the ability of bradykinin to prevent hypertrophy was investigated in adult rat ventricular myocytes cocultured with bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). 3. In myocytes cocultured with normal BAEC, angiotensin II (AngII; 1 mumol/L) significantly increased [3H]-phenylalanine incorporation (an in vitro marker of hypertrophy) by 32 +/- 2%. This was abolished by bradykinin (10 mumol/L). 4. Pretreatment of BAEC with high glucose (25 mmol/L for 24 h) prior to coculture with myocytes reduced the antihypertrophic effect of bradykinin, but did not modulate the hypertrophic effect of AngII. 5. Pretreatment of BAEC with hyperglycaemia abolishes the antihypertrophic efficacy of bradykinin in rat ventricular myocytes cocultured with BAEC. This has implications for the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "148": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade in neonatal, but not in weaned, rats induces irreversible renal histologic abnormalities and an impaired urinary concentrating ability. The aim of the present study was to define the postnatal time frame when the rat kidney is vulnerable to an interruption of the renin-angiotensin system. Male Wistar rats received daily injections of enalapril (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) during different age intervals within 3 to 24 d,of age. Fluid handling and urinary concentrating ability, renal function under pentobarbital anesthesia, and kidney histology using stereologic techniques were evaluated in adult rats. Enalapril treatment within 3 to 13 d after birth induced abnormalities in renal function and morphology long-term, whereas treatment initiated at 14 d of age did not. The main histologic alterations were papillary atrophy, and a reduction in the volume of tubular epithelial cells in association with an increase in the proportion of interstitium, throughout the cortex and outer medulla. Functionally, the predominant defect was an impairment in urinary concentrating ability, which correlated with the degree of papillary atrophy. In conclusion, the vulnerable age interval for the induction of irreversible renal abnormalities by enalapril was the first 13 d after birth in the rat. This postnatal time span coincides with the completion of nephrogenesis and a period of marked tubular growth and differentiation, suggesting a pivotal role for angiotensin II in these processes.", 
    "149": "Chronic renal diseases progress to organ insufficiency, which may require replacement therapy within one to three decades even independently of the type of initial insults. In the majority of cases, the degrees of proteinuria and interstitial leukocyte infiltration and scarring are strictly correlated with the rate of disease progression. This study tests the hypothesis that excess intrarenal protein traffic may cause lymphocyte-dependent interstitial injury that, while not fully controlled by antiproteinuric therapy, can be further inhibited by concomitant immunosuppression. A primarily nonimmune model was used to reproduce progressive renal disease due to a critical loss of nephron mass. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor limited proteinuria, interstitial inflammation, MHC class II antigen expression, and severe lesions. Combined treatment with ACE inhibitor and a specific antilymphocyte agent, mycophenolate mofetil, dramatically attenuated macrophage and T cell infiltration, MHC-class II overexpression, dendritic cells, and all manifestations of the disease. Evidence of lymphocyte-mediated renal injury in the setting of excess protein traffic provides the basis for combining ACE inhibition and immunosuppression to halt progression of proteinuric kidney disease and minimize the need for dialysis or transplantation.", 
    "150": "GFR normally increases during glycine infusion. This response is absent in humans and rats with established diabetes mellitus. In diabetic patients, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) restores the effect of glycine on GFR. To ascertain the glomerular hemodynamic basis for this effect of ACEI, micropuncture studies were performed in male Wistar-Froemter rats after 5 to 6 wk of insulin-treated streptozotocin diabetes. The determinants of single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) were assessed in each rat before and during glycine infusion. Studies were performed in diabetics, diabetics after 5 d of ACEI (enalapril in the drinking water), and weight-matched controls. Diabetic rats manifest renal hypertrophy and glomerular hyperfiltration but not glomerular capillary hypertension. ACEI reduced glomerular capillary pressure, increased glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient, and did not mitigate hyperfiltration. In controls, glycine increased SNGFR by 30% due to increased nephron plasma flow. In diabetics, glycine had no effect on any determinant of SNGFR. In ACEI-treated diabetics, the SNGFR response to glycine was indistinguishable from nondiabetics, but the effect of glycine was mediated by greater ultrafiltration pressure rather than by greater plasma flow. These findings demonstrate that: (1) The absent response to glycine in established diabetes does not indicate that renal functional reserve is exhausted by hyperfiltration; and (2) ACEI restores the GFR response to glycine in established diabetes, but this response is mediated by increased ultrafiltration pressure rather than by increased nephron plasma flow.", 
    "151": "We measured changes in heart rate and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity in conscious, spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats during acute blood pressure lowering with nicardipine, enalaprilat and concomitant nicardipine/enalaprilat administration. In a second experiment, we determined the effect of these drugs on arterial baroreflex control of lumbar sympathetic nerve activity.", 
    "152": "Male spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats were instrumented for continuous heart rate, blood pressure and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity recordings. Twenty-four hours later in conscious rats, nicardipine, enalaprilat and enalaprilat/nicardipine were infused at sufficient doses to reduce mean arterial pressure by 20 mmHg over 30 min. In a second experiment with the same drugs, baroreflex curves relating lumbar sympathetic nerve activity to mean arterial pressure were analyzed using a logistic curve-fitting program.", 
    "153": "Blood pressure reductions induced by the three infusion protocols were similar in magnitude and profile. In both spontaneously hypertensive and Wistar-Kyoto rats, nicardipine induced greater reflexive increases in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity than enalaprilat Pretreatment with a reduced dose of enalaprilat blunted subsequent nicardipine-induced sympathetic activation. Nicardipine tended to induce greater increases in the heart rate than enalaprilat, but overall, the difference was not significant Baroreflex sensitivity was similar regardless of drug class. Nicardipine significantly increased minimum nerve activity compared with enalaprilat in spontaneously hypertensive rats (similar trends were observed in Wistar-Kyoto rats). This increase in minimum nerve activity was blunted by enalaprilat", 
    "154": "These results indicate that pretreatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor minimizes dihydropyridine-induced increases in sympathetic activity. This beneficial effect is attributable to suppression of minimum sympathetic activity. These data suggest that co-administration of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor may improve the long-term cardiovascular benefit of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers.",

Amiodarone should be reserved for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in older persons who cannot tolerate or who do not respond to beta-blockers. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors should be used to treat older persons with heart failure, an anterior myocardial infarction, or a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40%.

    "161": "Atherosclerosis is associated with vascular endothelial dysfunction and reduced nitric oxide (NO) activity. Enhancement of NO activity may have an antiatherogenic action. This study was performed to determine whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition improves peripheral vascular NO activity in patients with atherosclerosis. In the femoral circulation of 43 patients with atherosclerosis and 10 controls, we studied endothelium-dependent vasodilation with bradykinin and acetylcholine, and endothelium-independent vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside before and after enalaprilat. In 22 patients, we repeated these infusions in the presence of L-N(G) monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA). Doppler-femoral artery flow velocity was measured. Before ACE inhibition, acetylcholine responses were depressed in patients with atherosclerosis compared with controls (p = 0.03). Enalaprilat did not alter femoral vascular tone at rest or vasodilation with sodium nitroprusside, but potentiated bradykinin-mediated vasodilation in patients (p<0.001) and controls (p = 0.02). Acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was augmented only in patients (p<0.001), but not in control subjects. L-NMMA inhibited the potentiation by enalaprilat of acetylcholine and bradykinin responses. This study demonstrates that ACE inhibition selectively improves endothelial dysfunction in human atherosclerosis by enhancing NO activity. The antithrombotic and antiproliferative effects of NO may reduce adverse manifestations related to atherosclerosis during long-term therapy.",

Background (> or = 2 microaneurysms or > or = 2 hemorrhages or > or = 1 more advanced lesions, except proliferative changes) and proliferative retinopathies were found in 21% and in 3%, respectively. Subjects with microalbuminuria (p = 0.026) and overt nephropathy (p = 0.002) had more frequently background retinopathy than their counterparts with a normal UAER (chi2-test). A multivariate logistic regression model was obtained for background retinopathy (chi2 = 37.5, p = 0.0000039, OR 14.9, correct prediction of negative outcome in 97% and of positive outcome in 30.4%) including the following variables. The fractional clearance of albumin independently explained background retinopathy (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.3-12, p = 0.028). Insulin therapy (p = 0.0017), diabetes duration (p = 0.048), blood glucose at 2 h in standard oral glucose tolerance test (p = 0.009) and low fasting serum HDL cholesterol (p = 0.023) also independently explained retinopathy. Age, gender, BMI, systolic blood pressure, ACE inhibitor therapy, fasting serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, blood glucose or insulin, hemoglobin A1c, glucagon-stimulated C peptide response, glomerular filtration rate or smoking habits did not independently explain retinopathy.",

We examined the influence of deletion (D) and insertion (I) polymorphism in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the other polymorphic markers of RAS, and that of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) on renal scarring in reflux nephropathy. Ninety-four children with third- or fourth-degree reflux were the subject of the study. They were stratified into two groups according to the technetium-99m-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) findings: the first group consisted of 41 patients with no scar formation. In the second group (n = 53), there was significant scar formation in the refluxing units. ACE levels, ACE gene, angiotensin-1 receptor (AT1) A1166C, angiotensinogen (ATG) M235T, and PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphisms were studied. In the second group with scarred kidneys, 18 patients had decreased renal function. The frequency of patients homozygous for the D allele was significantly greater in the second group with scar formation in the refluxing units compared with the first group of patients (P < 0.005). On multivariate analysis, the DD genotype was the only factor that had a significant impact on renal scar formation, introducing a 4.9-fold risk (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval). We were unable to find any correlation with the presence ofDD genotype and hypertension, decreased renal function, proteinuria, or sex of the patient. DDgenotype correlated with the serum ACE levels (P < 0.005). AT1and ATGpolymorphisms and PAI-1 polymorphism did not correlate with scar formation or any of the parameters. This study provides evidence that the DDgenotype of ACE may be a genetic susceptibility factor contributing to adverse renal prognosis in reflux nephropathy; namely, scar formation. The role of the synergism between the aforementioned genetic polymorphisms can be enlightened with larger patient groups, possibly through multicenter studies.",

The resistive index increased in the nonstenotic kidney (P < 0.01) but not in the stenotic kidney after administration of enalaprilat. The difference in resistive indices between nonstenotic and stenotic kidneys increased significantly (P < 0.05) after administration of enalaprilat.

While they do not have the inhibitory potency of synthetic drugs commonly used in the treatment of hypertension, these naturally occurring peptides may represent nutraceutical/functional food ingredients for the prevention/treatment of high blood pressure. Studies with gastric and pancreatic proteinase digests of whey proteins indicate that enzyme specificity rather than extent of hydrolysis dictates the ACE inhibitory potency of whey hydrolysates.",

Focus was put on the peptides derived from milk casein by the action of some proteolytic enzymes and fermented products by lactic acid bacteria. Some of the angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory peptides exhibit significant antihypertensive effects in spontaneously hypertensive rats. However, there were some antihypertensive peptides with low inhibitory activity of this enzyme. Key factors needed for the peptide to demonstrate the antihypertensive effects are discussed. Fermented milk, which has inhibitory activity of the enzyme, showed the reduction of blood pressure of hypertensive subjects. The possibility of the bioactive peptides for functional foods are also discussed.", 
    "198": "Due to its hemodynamic, metabolic and growth promoting effects, angiotensin II (AII) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic kidney disease. Consequently, decreasing the production or cellular action of AII is a rational target for therapeutic attempts aimed at slowing the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Based on their superior renoprotective performance in recent landmark studies, currently ACE inhibitors are the drugs of choice in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria. A new class of antihypertensive medications, the AT1 receptor antagonists may represent an alternative to ACE inhibitors in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. They provide a more complete blockade of the renal renin-angiotensin system and are generally better tolerated than ACE inhibitors. On the other hand, AT1 receptor antagonists do not increase bradykinin levels, an effect that may contribute to the high level of renoprotection achieved by ACE inhibitors. Although human data are not available at this point, ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists have similar beneficial effects on proteinuria, renal hypertrophy and glomerulosclerosis in animal models of diabetic kidney disease. Currently several prospective studies are being conducted to compare the efficacy of ACE inhibitors and AT1 receptor antagonists in the treatment of human diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "199": "We evaluated the effects of angiotensin II and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (cilazapril) on nerve blood flow (NBF) and electrophysiology in control and diabetic rats. When applied locally to the sciatic nerve, the dose-response curve of angiotensin II was more potent in experimental diabetic neuropathy (EDN) than control rats. No difference existed in plasma angiotensin II levels between EDN and controls. The rats were given typical rat pellets or pellets treated with 10 mg/kg per day cilazapril for 4 weeks. Diabetes caused a significant reduction in NBF, nerve conduction velocity, and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes. NBF was significantly increased in diabetic rats supplemented with cilazapril diet, and nerve conduction velocity and amplitudes of the CMAP were also improved after 4 weeks on this diet. Direct application 10(-3) mol/L cilazapril on sciatic nerve did not increase NBF in normal and EDN rats. We topically applied the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine, on sciatic nerve and observed reduced inhibition of NBF in EDN, which was correctable with a cilazapril diet. These results suggest that diabetic neuropathy may have an increasing vasopressor action with angiotensin II and this is likely to be the mechanism of NOS inhibition. Angiotensin II-converting enzyme inhibitors may have potential in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.",

We recorded age, gender, urgency of operation, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, ejection fraction, pump time, cross-clamp time, use of antifibrinolytics, type of oxygenator, amrinone use, postoperative biochemical and hematologic values, medication use, fluid balance, intensive care unit admission duration, and hospital admission duration. We assessed the role of diabetes mellitus, current smoking, and systemic hypertension. The incidence of the low-SVR state was 35 of 79 patients during a 3-month period (44%). At 8 hrs postoperatively, the SVRi in low-SVR and non-low-SVR patients was 1594+/-50 (SEM) and 2103+/-56 (SEM) dyne x sec/cm5 x m2, respectively (p < .001). In low-SVR patients, there was an initial and sustained increase in cardiac index and central venous pressure that preceded the decrease in mean arterial pressure. The decrease in mean arterial pressure was maximal at 8 hrs postoperatively. Patients with low SVR were more likely to have longer cross-clamp times, to be male, and to have lower postoperative platelet counts (p < .05 for all).

This prospective, observational study involved 16 patients with non-ischemic, moderate heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class IIM-III] receiving an optimal basic regimen of digitalis, diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Eight patients (Group P) were also administered pimobendan at a dose of 2.5 or 5 mg daily, while the other 8 served as controls (Group C). After 3 months of pimobendan administration, the plasma levels of norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide decreased and left ventricular ejection fraction improved. After 1 year, the cardiac symptoms, assessed using the Specific Activity Scale as well as the NYHA functional class, improved and the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased. These improvements in Group P were maintained for 2 years. However, in Group C, the cardiac symptoms and the neurohumoral factor levels remained unchanged or deteriorated during this study, and one patient died of heart failure. Long-term combination therapy with the optimal basic regimen and pimobendan has potentially beneficial effects on neurohumoral factor levels and cardiac symptoms in patients with non-ischemic, chronic moderate heart failure.",

Our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of hypertensive disease and the optimal treatment of hypertension in Black patients continues to evolve, especially with the introduction of new drugs and the need for prognostic data in this ethnic population. We review the management of hypertensive disease in the black population, emphasizing race-related differences in the pathophysiology of hypertension and the importance of tailored management in this group of patients, including sensible application of non-pharmacological measures with effective antihypertensive agents. For example, diuretics and calcium antagonists are suitable first-line agents in black hypertensives, whilst beta-blockers and the ACE inhibitors tend to be less effective at lowering blood pressure, due to the low renin state in these patients.",

Insulin sensitivity was evaluated using an insulin suppression test in 40 newly diagnosed patients with coronary artery disease and no previous history of metabolic disorders, who were not taking any medication which might affect insulin sensitivity. The insulin suppression test consisted of a constant infusion of glucose, insulin and somatostatin for 150 min; insulin resistance was estimated by determining the steady-state plasma glucose concentrations during the last 60 minutes of the test. The insulin sensitivity index was calculated by the formula: insulin sensitivity index = (glucose infusion rate/steady state plasma glucose concentrations) x 10(3). A second insulin suppression test was performed after 6 months' therapy with either isosorbide mononitrate, atenolol, diltiazem or captopril in 30 of the 40 patients. There were no differences between any of the groups before therapy was initiated. After 6 months, patients treated with captopril and, to a lesser extent, those treated with diltiazem showed statistically significantly decreased steady state plasma glucose concentrations and increased insulin sensitivity index compared to basal values. No statistically significant differences were found in the other two groups. We conclude that captopril and, to a lesser extent, diltiazem improve insulin sensitivity in patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

Twelve patients with type I diabetes and with microalbuminuria were allocated to treatment for 3 years with either an ACE inhibitor (group I, 6 patients) or a beta blocker (group II, 6 patients). Baseline and follow-up renal needle biopsy specimens were taken and serially sectioned at 1 microm for light microscopy, enabling identification of arterioles as afferent or efferent. Thin sections for electron microscopy were made at 50-microm intervals, and micrographs were taken of arteriolar profiles. Matrix volume fraction of the media and a calculated matrix thickness were obtained. At baseline, structural parameters were higher than normal values. At follow-up all patients were normoalbuminuric. Both groups showed only minor changes in arteriolar structures over 3 years. In the afferent arterioles in group II there was a significant increase in the matrix volume fraction of the media, and there was a tendency to an increase in matrix thickness in both groups. In the efferent arterioles there were no significant changes in parameters. There were no differences between the two groups in arteriolar structural changes from baseline to follow-up. Thus, this study shows a slight but significant matrix accumulation in the afferent arterioles during treatment with antihypertensive drugs. This may have implications for the progression to overt nephropathy, which indicates a need for more long-term studies of treatment with antihypertensive drugs in incipient nephropathy in type I diabetes.",

    "222": "A drug-excipient compatibility screening model was developed by which potential stability problems due to interactions of drug substances with excipients in solid dosage forms can be predicted. The model involved storing drug-excipient blends with 20% added water in closed glass vials at 50 degrees C and analyzing them after 1 and 3 weeks for chemical and physical stability. The total weight of drug-excipient blend in a vial was usually kept at about 200 mg. The amount of drug substance in a blend was determined on the basis of the expected drug-to-excipient ratio in the final formulation. Potential roles of several key factors, such as the chemical nature of the excipient, drug-to-excipient ratio, moisture, microenvironmental pH of the drug-excipient mixture, temperature, and light, on dosage form stability could be identified by using the model. Certain physical changes, such as polymorphic conversion or change from crystalline to amorphous form, that could occur in drug-excipient mixtures were also studied.

Moxonidine selectively stimulates imidazoline receptors located in the medulla, which centrally inhibit sympathetic outflow. PNE is suppressed and peripheral vasodilation reduces systemic blood pressure. This study evaluated the acute neurohumoral and hemodynamic effects of a single dose of oral moxonidine in 32 patients (22 men, mean +/- SD age 66 +/- 10 years) with CHF. All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III and stabilized on chronic therapy with diuretics, digitalis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Patients underwent invasive hemodynamic monitoring after double-blind randomization to either placebo (n = 12), moxonidine 0.4 mg (n = 9), or moxonidine 0.6 mg (n = 11). Moxonidine produced a dose-dependent, vasodilator response compared with placebo. Analysis of the time-averaged change from baseline over 6 hours demonstrated that moxonidine 0.6 mg caused significant reductions in mean systemic arterial pressure (p <0.0001), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p <0.005), systemic vascular resistance (p <0.05), pulmonary vascular resistance (p <0.01), and heart rate (p <0.05). Stroke volume was unchanged. PNE was reduced substantially (-180 pg/ml at 4 hours, p <0.005) and the reduction was highly correlated with the baseline level (r = -0.968). Moxonidine was well tolerated in this single-dose study and resulted in a modest, dose-dependent, vasodilator response, with substantial reductions in systemic and pulmonary arterial blood pressure.

Cough occurs much less often with these agents than with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and they do not adversely affect lipid profiles or cause rebound hypertension after discontinuation.

The in-vitro intrinsic elastic properties of the wall in treated SHR coronary arteries were determined in comparison to those of SHR rats. In preconstricted preparations, agonist- and flow-induced dilatations were investigated in arteries of both groups. Arterial segments were cannulated at both ends using an arteriograph system. Internal diameter and wall thickness were continuously monitored while intraluminal pressure and flow were controlled. Wall thickness was reduced in arteries of treated rats compared to those in control SHR (mm): 52 +/- 2 vs. 41 +/- 2, P < 0.001, respectively. Arterial stiffness, expressed by the incremental elastic modulus-stress relationship, was significantly lower in arteries of treated compared to control SHRs. In preconstricted preparations, dilatations induced by bradykinin were significantly greater in treated SHR compared to control SHR arteries whereas dilatations induced by acetylcholine were slightly but not significantly increased. On the other hand, starting flow at the plateau of 5-HT-induced constriction led to dilatations which were not significantly different in the treated compared to the control group. The maximal dilatation induced by flow in arteries of treated rats was obtained for the same value of shear stress compared to that determined in preparations of control SHRs: (dyn/cm2) 63 +/- 3 vs. 61 +/- 2, respectively, NS. These results show that together with hypertrophy, the abnormal mechanical properties observed in the coronary arterial wall of SHR were improved by a low dose of trandolapril treatment. However, differential effects of trandolapril treatment were observed on agonist and flow-induced dilatations. Although flow-induced dilatation seemed to remain unaffected, acetylcholine-induced dilatation was slightly improved and bradykinin-induced dilatation was markedly increased by trandolapril treatment.", 
    "232": "In this review, therapeutic trials for treatment of IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) are reviewed and discussed. No disease-specific therapy exists. For treatment of hypertensive patients, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are preferred. They also decrease proteinuria and probably slow disease progression. However, there are still no controlled data on the effectiveness of ACE-inhibitors in the absence of hypertension or proteinuria. Renewed enthusiasm for treatment with fish oil arose after the publication of a randomized controlled trial in 1994 and long-term follow-up data of the trial cohort in 1998. Corticoid therapy in IgA nephropathy has been advocated for patients with nephrotic syndrome or crescentic disease. A recent non-randomised trial with long-term follow-up suggests that, in the presence of moderate proteinuria, corticosteroids may ameliorate renal function if administered before the creatinine clearance has decreased below 70 ml/min. Preliminary data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) may reduce the risk of clinically significant IgA nephropathy recurring in kidney allografts. Many other promising treatment approaches have been tested, but in most instances results are insufficient for unequivocal conclusions. Several randomized controlled clinical trials are currently testing prednisone, fish oil, ACE-inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, MMF and vitamin E. In the absence of a disease-specific treatment, control of hypertension, proteinuria and probably dyslipidemia are pivotal.

Concentrations of bcl-2 were higher in patients with proteinuria than in those without proteinuria. A 6-month course of 5 mg/day lisinopril given to subjects with proteinuria significantly reduced blood bcl-2 concentrations and caused a reduction in proteinuria. Therefore increased blood bcl-2 concentrations may be considered an index of risk in subjects with IgA nephropathy, and the positive effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on proteinuria in patients with IgA nephropathy may be attributed, at least in part, to their effect on the mechanisms that regulate apoptosis.

    "250": "Although the prevalence of nephrotoxicity in patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is relatively low, the extensive use profile of these agents implies that many persons are at risk. At basal states of normal renal function, the role of renal prostaglandin production for maintenance of stable renal hemodynamic function is relatively limited. Nonetheless, in the clinical setting of reduced renal perfusion as seen in various forms of cardio-renal disease, dehydration, and the aging kidney, the adequacy of renal prostaglandin production mediated predominantly by cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and, potentially, by COX-2 enzyme activity becomes of major significance in the activation of compensatory renal hemodynamics. Inhibition of renal prostaglandin production by the use of NSAIDs in these circumstances can potentially lead to the emergence of several distinct syndromes of disturbed renal function. These include fluid and electrolyte disorders, acute renal dysfunction, nephrotic syndrome/ interstitial nephritis, and renal papillary necrosis. In addition, by blunting the homeostatic renal effects of prostaglandins, NSAIDs can adversely influence blood pressure control, particularly during the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, and beta blockers. This is a matter of considerable public health concern, in that some 12 million US citizens are concurrently treated with NSAIDs and antihypertensive drugs. Finally, the risk of congestive heart failure is significantly increased when NSAIDs are given to patients receiving diuretic therapy who have cardiovascular risk factors. Physiologic factors, clinical presentations, diagnostic modalities, and clinical management strategies appropriate to these NSAID-induced renal syndromes are described.",

Pregnancy outcomes included abortion, miscarriage, preterm and term birth, and perinatal death. Complications of pregnancy and scleroderma were determined during and after pregnancy.", 
    "253": "Fifty-nine women with systemic sclerosis had 91 pregnancies during the 10-year period. No increase in the frequency of miscarriage was found, except in those with long-standing diffuse scleroderma. Preterm births occurred in 29% of pregnancies, and all but one of the infants survived. Symptoms related to scleroderma, particularly Raynaud phenomenon, improved during pregnancy, but esophageal reflux became worse. After pregnancy, some women with diffuse scleroderma had increased skin thickening. There were three cases of renal crisis during pregnancy, all in women with early diffuse scleroderma. Four women had five healthy infants while taking angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "254": "Women with systemic sclerosis can safely have healthy pregnancies. Those with early diffuse scleroderma should wait until their disease stabilizes before becoming pregnant to decrease the risk of renal crisis. High-risk pregnancy management should be standard for all scleroderma pregnancies because of the high frequency of premature births.", 
    "255": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus often develop micro- and macrovascular complications. In 25% of them, complications are already present at the time of diagnosis. The principal objective of the United Kingdom prospective diabetes study was to determine if good blood glucose control and adequate treatment of hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus can prevent development of diabetes-related complications. The question was also studied if they way in which this blood glucose control was achieved and the way of treating the blood pressure affected the prognosis. Blood glucose control was found to reduce the incidence of--especially--microvascular complications. Oral hypoglycaemic agents and insulin both play an important part in achieving good control. Treatment with metformin reduced mortality due to cardiovascular disease in obese patients. Strict control of the blood pressure reduced development of micro- and macrovascular complications; the mortality from diabetes-related disorders and the numbers of patients suffering a stroke or heart failure. Non of the antihypertensive drugs used (an ACE inhibitor and a beta-blocking agent) offered any advantages over the other.", 
    "256": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system has emerged as a potential candidate for the accumulation of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts. The traditional renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can be considered a system in which circulating angiotensin II or aldosterone is delivered to target tissue or cells. However, an independent local renin-angiotensin system has also been described in cardiac cells and evidence has been accumulated for autocrine and/or paracrine pathways by which biological actions of angiotensin II can be mediated. These actions of angiotensin II are primarily mediated through angiotensin II receptors of the subtype I (AT1). When evaluating the effects of angiotensin II in situ, changes in circulating levels and local production both have to be taken into account. Functional angiotensin II receptors have been documented in cardiac fibroblasts although the presence of aldosterone receptors in cardiac fibroblasts is obscure, and the expression of mRNA for mineralocorticoid receptors in cardiac fibroblasts has been described. In vitro, angiotensin II increased cardiac fibroblast-mediated collagen synthesis and mRNA levels of collagen type I, type III, pro-alpha 1 (I) collagen, pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen and fibronectin, and inhibited matrix metalloproteinase I activity. The ability of angiotensin II to induce collagen synthesis and expression of collagen in cardiac fibroblasts may be mediated by an increase in transforming growth factor-beta 1 in an autocrine/paracrine fashion. The angiotensin II-stimulated secretion and expression of collagen was completely abolished by AT1 receptor antagonism, but not affected by AT2 receptor antagonism. The discordant findings that have been reported concerning the in vitro effect of aldosterone on collagen synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts can at least partly be attributed to differences in methodology such as the use of the total population or a sub-population of cardiac fibroblasts. In vivo, chronic infusion of angiotensin II or aldosterone increased the collagen volume fraction in the ventricles. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT1 receptor antagonism, but not AT2 receptor antagonism, reduced collagen deposition in the myocardium in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The cardioprotective mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors can be attributed to local blockade of the formation of angiotensin II, to the degradation of bradykinin or to the release of nitric oxide and/or eicosanoids. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors also reduced collagen deposition in rat myocardium following myocardial infarction suggesting that collagen deposition may in part result from mechanisms other than through AT1 receptors. However, further research is necessary to unravel the various mechanisms involved in the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or of AT1 receptor antagonists on collagen deposition in the myocardium.", 
    "257": "In England, recent health care reforms emphasise the role of clinical guidelines in promoting effective and efficient health care. Introducing economic data into guidelines raises some methodological issues: specifically, the provision of valid and generalisable cost estimates, the weight placed upon cost 'evidence', and the presentation of cost-effectiveness information in a manner accessible to clinicians. A series of primary care guidelines, explicitly including consideration of health economic information, have recently been published, intended to help clinicians to aggregate the attributes of treatment choices to derive treatment recommendations consistent with both the clinical decision-making process and social objectives. Clinicians involved in developing guidelines responded well to the process and consistently managed to agree treatment recommendations, often after considerable debate about the evidence for treatment. In none of the guideline areas, all of which addressed common diseases, was there adequate information to estimate a cost per quality-adjusted-life-year, and it is unclear how helpful this approach would have been had it been possible. The implications of this method are discussed, guidance offered for economists new to guideline development and future areas of work identified.", 
    "258": "We have previously shown that chronic treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril increased striatal dopamine levels by 2.5-fold in normal Sprague-Dawley rats, possibly via modulation of the striatal opioid or tachykinin levels. In the present study, we investigated if this effect of perindopril persists in an animal model of Parkinson's disease, the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mouse. C57BL/6 mice were treated with the neurotoxin (30 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally) for 4 days and then left for 3 weeks to allow the degeneration of striatal dopaminergic terminals. At this time, the mice exhibited a 40% decrease in striatal dopamine content and an accompanying 46% increase in dopamine D2 receptor levels compared with control untreated mice. The dopamine content returned to control levels, and the increase in dopamine D2 receptor levels was attenuated in mice treated with perindopril (5 mg/kg/day orally for 7 days) 2 weeks after the last dose of MPTP. When the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was administered (5 mg/kg/day for 7 days) immediately after the cessation of the MPTP treatment, there was no reversal of the effect of the neurotoxin in decreasing striatal dopamine content. Our results demonstrate that perindopril is an effective agent in increasing striatal dopamine content in an animal model of Parkinson's disease.",

The amount of urinary 8-OHdG was not significantly different between SHRSP treated with anti-hypertensive agents and those not treated at 14 weeks of age. 3.

    "267": "In general both groups practice in conformity with published guidelines. However, there were important differences between the practice patterns of general cardiologists and HF specialists. For instance, in patients being evaluated for the first time, cardiologists reported using a chest radiograph to assist in the diagnosis more than did HF specialists (47% vs 12%), whereas HF specialists were more likely to use an echocardiogram (73% vs 48%). Both groups were likely to evaluate their patients for ischemia and possible revascularization, even in patients not having angina. However, HF specialists tended to use coronary angiography as the initial diagnostic test, whereas cardiologists were more likely to use stress testing. HF specialists more often used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as part of their initial therapy in patients with mild to moderate HF (94% vs 86%) and during maintenance therapy (91% vs 80%). Also, HF specialists were more likely than cardiologists to titrate angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to higher doses (75% vs 35%), even in the presence of renal dysfunction.",

However, in many areas, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, HF specialists do so more aggressively. These approaches may, in part, explain the success of the HF clinic model and raise the possibility that some portion of the HF population may be more optimally managed by cardiologists with a special interest in and additional training or experience with this condition.",

Mean age at enrollment was 66 years, 68% were men, 67% had an ischemic cause of heart disease, and 78% had systolic dysfunction. Patients with preserved systolic function were older, more often female, had higher mean systolic blood pressures, and a lower prevalence of ischemic heart disease, ventricular arrhythmias, or impaired renal function when compared with those with systolic dysfunction (all P </=.001). Although there was a significant negative trend in survival with decreasing ejection fraction (P =. 03), the survival experience of those with CHF and preserved systolic function did not significantly differ from those with systolic failure (P =.25). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed increased mortality risk was associated with increasing age, New York Heart Association class IV, ischemic cause of disease, elevated serum creatinine level, use of diuretics, and systolic dysfunction, whereas use of beta-blockers was associated with reduced risk.",

Mean follow-up period was 16 months. Ten patients died during follow-up: 9 of cardiac causes and 1 of stroke. Nine of these 10 patients had heart rate variability <10 beats/min (P =.004). The sensitivity and specificity of this test for cardiovascular mortality is 90.0% and 68.0%, respectively. The negative predictive value is 99.2% and the relative risk is 16.6.

    "277": "1. The role of both exogenously administered and endogenously generated bradykinin (BK) on LPS-induced eosinophil accumulation in the mice pleural cavity was investigated by means of treatment with BK selective receptor agonists/antagonists and captopril. 2. Intrathoracic (i.t.) injection of LPS (250 ng cavity(-1)) induced eosinophil influx at 24 h as previously described (Bozza et al., 1993). Pretreatment with the B1 receptor antagonist des-Arg9-[leu-8]BK (0.025 and 0.25 nmol cavity(-1)) showed no effect on this phenomenon, whereas pretreatment with the B2 receptor antagonists, NPC 17731 (0.025 and 0.25 nmol cavity(-1)) or HOE 140 (2.5 nmol cavity(-1)), increased LPS-induced eosinophil influx. Accordingly, pretreatment with captopril at 10 mg kg(-1) i.p., inhibited eosinophil infiltration induced by LPS in the pleural cavity, suggesting that endogenous BK is down-regulating LPS-induced eosinophil accumulation. 3. BK administered at 15 and 25 nmol cavity(-1), i.t. or i.p. also inhibited LPS-induced eosinophil accumulation. BK alone had no effect on the basal number of leucocytes in the pleural or peritoneal cavity in doses up to 25 nmol cavity(-1). Nevertheless, when injected at doses of 50 and 100 nmol cavity(-1) BK induced leucocyte influx characterized by neutrophil and eosinophil accumulation at 24 h. 4. Similarly to what was observed with BK, a specific B2 receptor agonist, Tyr8BK, administered at 0.25 nmol cavity(-1) i.p., significantly inhibited the eosinophil influx induced by LPS. 5. The mechanism by which B2 receptor agonists inhibit LPS-induced eosinophil accumulation was investigated by pretreating the animals with indomethacin or a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, NS-398. Pretreatment with either indomethacin or NS-398 had no effect on eosinophil influx induced by LPS alone, but those drugs were able to restore the LPS-induced eosinophil influx in Tyr8BK (0.25 nmol cavity(-1)) injected mice. 6. In conclusion, endogenously generated bradykinin seems to modulate, through activation of B2 receptors, eosinphil accumulation induced by LPS via a mechanism dependent on prostanoid synthesis.", 
    "278": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors play an important role in protecting various organs in patients with congestive heart failure. The mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors in congestive heart failure are multiple and may involve important effects on endothelial function in addition to the well known hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects. Skeletal muscle fatigue can play an important role in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, and only aggressive treatment with ACE inhibitors and exercise training can improve exercise tolerance and reduce the risk of further deterioration of cardiac function. ACE inhibitors should be introduced with caution in patients with severe heart failure and hypotension to prevent renal dysfunction. Unlike some other ACE inhibitors, perindopril seems to cause no first dose hypotension. It also appears to have a neutral effect on renal function in patients with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "279": "Although both blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular (LV) mass at initial evaluation predict future cardiovascular risk, the actual BP and LV mass achieved over years of treatment more clearly relate to cardiovascular event rates. Intermittent compliance or noncompliance is the major reason for uncontrolled hypertension and presumably persistent LV hypertrophy. In general, drugs with rapid onset and short duration of action are not desirable because this profile may lead to large variations in BP lowering effect during actual drug intake and rapid disappearance of the antihypertensive effect with missed doses. In addition, intermittent compliance per se introduces the potential for adverse events. For drugs requiring several dose-titrations (e.g., alpha1-blockers), restarting at full doses may lead to excessive drug action and symptomatic hypotension. For other drugs (e.g., short acting beta-blockers or clonidine-like drugs), sudden discontinuation with intermittent compliance may lead to rebound-enhanced sympathetic responsiveness after one to two days, resulting not only in side effects, but also in adverse events, particularly in patients with (silent) coronary artery disease. The rapid onset, short acting dihydropyridines cause intermittent BP control at each dosing, particularly at higher doses. This intermittent control of BP is even more apparent at dosing intervals that are long relative to the duration of action. Thus, sympathetic activation and potential for adverse events can be anticipated at each dosing unless these drugs are being taken frequently at relatively low doses. For diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin I receptor blockers, no adverse effects have been identified with intermittent compliance. Intermittent BP control is, in general, not an appropriate approach to the management of hypertension and introduces additional risks depending on the type of antihypertensive drug. In contrast, drugs with slow onset and long duration of action provide a more consistent effect during actual drug intake and a more persistent effect during short periods of noncompliance.",

However, in formulations with higher concentrations of sucrose (30 and 85% w/v, respectively), the stabilising effect was not apparent. Captopril in 1 mg/ml formulations containing 0.03 M citric buffer and 10% w/v glucose degraded rapidly in the presence of glucose oxidase. The degradation was particularly evident at higher temperature. Glucose oxidase is an antioxidant, which can extensively reduce oxygen concentration in liquid formulations.",

Other antihypertensive drugs did not change any parameter of heart rate or blood pressure variabilities.",

In patients with high plasma ACE concentrations, non-compliance should be considered along with inadequate dose titration. In patients with low plasma ACE and high AII concentrations, non-ACE mediated production of AII may be operative. Raised aldosterone concentrations appear to be more common than AII \"reactivation\".

Efficacy and safety were assessed by measuring changes in sitting BP and metabolic parameters associated with cardiovascular disease including triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol/HDL ratio and glucose. Adverse events were recorded continuously. After 12 weeks of treatment, moexipril 15 mg was significantly more effective in reducing sitting systolic and diastolic BP from baseline than placebo (-12.2/-9.9 mm Hg vs -1.6/-4.3 mm Hg, P < 0.001). Metabolic parameters were not affected by treatment with moexipril: mean levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol/HDL ratio and glucose remained unchanged throughout the study. Fibrinogen, an independent cardiovascular risk factor, increased after placebo (+35.0 mg/dl) and decreased after treatment with moexipril (-33.6 mg/dl), the difference, however, was not statistically significant.

For vascular endothelium, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of the most potent and specific growth factors, which acts protectively against endothelial dysfunction. HGF production is downregulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) in vitro. We hypothesized that HGF production is impaired as the result of increased Ang II in patients with congestive heart failure, and that if so, the impaired production should be restored with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I). We studied 16 patients with congestive heart failure caused by previous anterior myocardial infarction in whom left ventricular ejection fraction was 35+/-8% (mean+/-SD). Before and approximately 4 weeks after the treatment with ACE-I, blood samples were collected to measure the levels of HGF, Ang II, and brain natriuretic peptide as a biochemical marker for severity of heart failure. We also studied 5 control subjects, in whom heparin increased HGF production to 48+/-5-fold. However, in patients with heart failure, HGF response to heparin was significantly attenuated (24+/-5-fold, P<0.05 vs control). Therapy with ACE-I decreased the levels of Ang II and brain natriuretic peptide and restored HGF production in response to heparin by 43+/-7-fold, comparable to the control response. In conclusion, impaired HGF production was restored after the treatment with ACE-I probably by the mechanism of Ang II suppression. This novel effect of ACE-I may contribute to the clinical improvement in patients with heart failure and thereby may have an important therapeutic implication.", 
    "352": "TGR(mREN2)27 (TGR) rats are transgenic animals with an additional mouse renin gene, which leads to overactivity of the renin-angiotensin system. Adult TGR rats are characterized by fulminant hypertension, hypertensive end-organ damage, and an inverse circadian blood pressure pattern. To study the ontogenetic development of cardiovascular circadian rhythms, telemetric blood pressure transmitters were implanted in male Sprague-Dawley (SPRD, n = 5) and heterozygous, transgenic TGR rats before 5 weeks of age. The TGR received either drinking water or enalapril 10 mg/L in drinking water (n = 5 per group). Drug intake was measured throughout the study by computerized monitoring of drinking volume. Circadian patterns in blood pressure and heart rate were analyzed from 5 to 11 weeks of age. In the first week after transmitter implantation, blood pressure did not differ among SPRD, untreated, and enalapril-treated TGR rats. In parallel with the rise in blood pressure of untreated TGR rats, a continuous delay of the circadian acrophase (time of fitted blood pressure maximum) was observed, leading to a complete reversal of the rhythm in blood pressure at an age of 8 weeks. Enalapril reduced blood pressure at night, but was less effective during the day, presumably due to the drinking pattern of the animals, which ingested about 90% of their daily water intake during the nocturnal activity period. After discontinuation of treatment, blood pressure returned almost immediately to values found in untreated TGR rats. In conclusion, the inverse circadian blood pressure profile in TGR rats develops in parallel with the increase in blood pressure. Direct effects of the brain renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the disturbed circadian rhythmicity in TGR(mREN2)27 rats.", 
    "353": "1. We evaluated if the brain bradykinin (BK) B1 receptor is involved in the regulation of blood pressure (BP) in conscious rats. 2. Basal mean BP and HR were 115 +/- 2 and 165 +/- 3 mmHg and 345 +/- 10 and 410 +/- 14 beats min in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), respectively. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 1 nmol B1 receptor agonist Lys-desArg9-BK significantly increased the BP of WKY and SHR by 7+/-1 and 19+/-2 mmHg, respectively. One nmol Sar[D-Phe8]-desArg9-BK, a kininase-resistant B1 agonist, increased the BP of WKY and SHR by 19+/-2 and 17+/-2 mmHg, respectively and reduced HR in both strains. 3. I.c.v. injection of 0.01 nmol B1 antagonists, LysLeu8-desArg9-BK or AcLys[D-betaNal7,Ile8]-desArg9-BK (R715), significantly decreased mean BP in SHR (by 9+/-2 mmHg the former and 14+/-3 mmHg the latter compound), but not in WKY. In SHR, the BP response to R715 was associated to tachycardia. 4. I.c.v. Captopril, a kininase inhibitor, increased the BP of SHR, this response being partially prevented by i.c.v. R715 and reversed into a vasodepressor effect by R715 in combination with the B2 antagonist Icatibant. 5. I.c.v. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) targeted to the B1 receptor mRNA decreased BP in SHR, but not in WKY. HR was not altered in either strain. Distribution of fluorescein-conjugated ODNs was detected in brain areas surrounding cerebral ventricles. 6. Our results indicate that the brain B1 receptor participates in the regulation of BP. Activation of the B1 receptor by kinin metabolites could participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension in SHR.",

The size of the infarct was determined by tetrazolium staining and was expressed as the percent of the area at risk (%IS/AR). At the end of the experiment, the lungs were sampled for a tissue ACE activity assay. There was no significant difference in %IS/AR among the rabbits given placebo alone, placebo plus 2 minutes PC, and temocapril alone (%IS/AR = 59.5 +/- 5.8%, 43.6 +/- 3.7%, and 56.7 +/- 7.1%, respectively). However, %IS/AR was significantly reduced in the group that received temocapril and 2 minutes PC before infarction (%IS/AR = 35.4 +/- 4.8%, P < 0.05 vs. placebo control and temocapril control). The lung tissue ACE activity did not differ in the placebo-treated rabbits with and without PC (12.6 +/- 2.8 vs. 13.7 +/- 2.0 nmol/g protein/min) but was suppressed in temocapril-treated rabbits despite 2 minutes PC (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.5 +/- 0.2 nmol/g protein/min, both P < 0.05 vs. placebo-treated groups).

In animal experiments, losartan reverses left ventricular hypertrophy, inhibits myocardial fibrosis and diabetic glomerulosclerosis and significantly protects from vascular cerebral diseases. In humans, the efficacy of the angiotensin II antagonists and that of other antihypertensives is similar and is potentiated by the addition of a thiazide. They are very well tolerated and no important adverse reactions are reported.

    "357": "End-stage renal failure is a major cause of health-related expenditures in the Western countries. It can be prevented in many instances by therapeutic intervention first settled in animal models. Murine experimental models of nephron loss have led to the identification of several factors involved in renal disease progression. They include increased glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, glomerular hypertrophy, high blood glucose, high-level proteinuria, hypoxia, and genetic factors. The role of glomerular capillary hypertension and hypertrophy cannot, however, be established with certainty in man. Clinical studies have shown that male gender, increased systemic blood pressure, severe urinary albumin loss, type of initial nephropathy, diabetes, and genetic factors, all accelerate progression of renal disease to end-stage renal failure. It is now feasible to halt the progression of renal insufficiency. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, particularly in those patients with high-level proteinuria, and of blood glucose control in diabetic patients. The place that restricted protein diet and lipid lowering intervention should take, remains debated. Further clinical trials aimed at testing the efficacy of new drugs including endothelin receptor antagonists are warranted in those patients with vascular or tubulo-interstitial renal diseases.",

We investigated concurrent effects of captopril on blood pressure, cardiac mass, myocardial enzyme activities, glucose tolerance, and insulin action in young male SHR. At 10 weeks of age, SHR were randomized into two groups, one receiving distilled water, the other a captopril solution (50 mg/kg body weight/day). We also examined age-matched WKY receiving distilled water. Blood pressure was measured by tail-cuff during the 4-week treatment period and oral glucose tolerance was tested at the end of treatment. Hearts were weighed and ventricular tissue was assayed for activities of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and hexokinase. Growth rates were similar between captopril-treated and control SHR, but less than those of WKY. Captopril reduced blood pressure (134 +/- 8 v 177 +/- 8 mm Hg, P < .05) and left ventricular mass (-18%, P < .05) in SHR. Cardiac enzyme activities also changed with captopril treatment, reflecting an increased capacity for beta-oxidation of fatty acids and reduced potential for glucose phosphorylation in the left ventricle of SHR. Serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids after a brief fast and in response to oral glucose were not different after captopril treatment, suggesting no improvement in insulin action or glucose tolerance. In summary, treatment of young male SHR with captopril reduces blood pressure and cardiac mass, and promotes a small but significant increase in cardiac capacity for oxidation of fatty acids and reduction of glucose phosphorylation. In contrast, metabolic effects of captopril on oral glucose tolerance and insulin action were not evident.", 
    "359": "Our objective was to evaluate the safety and antihypertensive efficacy of sampatrilat, a novel dual inhibitor of both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), in subjects poorly responsive to ACE inhibitor monotherapy. The ability of sampatrilat (50 to 100 mg daily) (n = 28) to lower blood pressure was compared with that of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril (10 to 20 mg daily) (n = 30) using a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study design over a 56-day treatment period in black hypertensives. Changes in systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were determined using repeated ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring. Both sampatrilat and lisinopril decreased plasma ACE concentrations after 28 and 56 days. The decrease in plasma ACE concentrations (U/L) was greater after lisinopril (-9.33 +/- 0.52) as compared with sampatrilat (-6.31 +/- 0.70) (P = .0001) therapy. Lisinopril, but not sampatrilat, increased plasma renin activity. Lisinopril produced a transient decrease in mean 24-h ABP (mm Hg) at 28 days (SBP = -9.0 +/- 2.3, DBP = -5.7 +/- 1.3; P < .01), which returned to pretreatment values by 56 days of therapy. Alternatively, sampatrilat produced a sustained decrease in mean ABP over the 56-day treatment period (day 28: SBP = -7.3 +/- 1.8, DBP = -5.2 +/- 1.2; P < .01: day 56: SBP = -7.8 +/- 1.5; DBP = -5.2 +/- 0.95; P < 0.01) with a greater treatment effect on DBP than that of lisinopril at day 56 (P = .05). Treatment-emergent adverse events were noted to be similar between both treatment groups. We conclude that the antihypertensive actions of ACE/NEP inhibitor monotherapy in black subjects offers a novel therapeutic approach to patients otherwise resistant to the sustained antihypertensive actions of ACE inhibitor monotherapy.",

Twenty-one patients with essential hypertension were treated with either TEM (n = 11) or CAD (n = 10) for one year. LV mass index (LVMI) by echocardiography and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (SV1 + RV5), Cornell voltage (RaVL + SV3) and RV5 + RV6 by standard 12-lead electrocardiographic voltages were determined before and after treatment. Both drugs decreased blood pressure to the same extent. Both Sokolow-Lyon voltage and RV5 + RV6 tended to decrease in the ACE group (40.0 +/- 9.4 to 37.2 +/- 9.4 mm and 44.7 +/- 13.5 to 41.7 +/- 11.7 mm, respectively, N.S.), but not in the CAD group (38.4 +/- 6.8 to 39.7 +/- 7.7 mm and 42.9 +/- 10.4 to 46.8 +/- 11.2 mm, respectively, N.S.). LVMI decreased in the ACE group (-24 +/- 22 g/m2), whereas it increased in the CAD group (37 +/- 27 g/m2, p < 0.01). Change in LVMI was correlated with the changes in RV5 + RV6 and Sokolow-Lyon voltage (r = 0.73, p < 0.01 and r = 0.70, p < 0.01, respectively), but not with that in Cornell voltage.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the interactions of exercise training and ACE inhibition (trandolapril) on these parameters in the obese Zucker rat. Animals were assigned to a sedentary control, a trandolapril-treated (1 mg. kg-1. day-1 for 6 wk), an exercise-trained (treadmill running for 6 wk), or a combined trandolapril-treated and exercise-trained group. Exercise training, alone or with trandolapril, significantly (P < 0. 05) increased peak O2 consumption by 31-34%. Similar decreases in fasting plasma insulin (34%) and free fatty acids (31%) occurred with exercise training alone or in combination with trandolapril. Compared with control, exercise training or trandolapril alone caused smaller areas under the curve (AUC) for glucose (12-14%) and insulin (28-33%) during an oral glucose tolerance test. The largest decreases in the glucose AUC (40%) and insulin AUC (53%) were observed in the combined group. Similarly, whereas exercise training or trandolapril alone improved maximally activated insulin-stimulated glucose transport in isolated epitrochlearis (26-34%) or soleus (39-41%) muscles, the greatest improvements in insulin action (67 and 107%, respectively) were seen in the combined group and were associated with similarly enhanced muscle GLUT-4 protein and total hexokinase levels. In conclusion, these results indicate combined exercise training and ACE inhibition improve oral glucose tolerance and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose transport to a greater extent than does either intervention alone.",

Angiogenesis was monitored in vivo by measurement of blood pressure, vasoreactivity, and resistance in ischemic versus normal limbs at day 10 (D10) and D40; angiographic studies to identify sites of neovascularization were performed at D10 and D40, and morphometric analysis of capillary density in the ischemic limb was performed at necropsy (D40). Both functional and morphological outcomes documented augmented angiogenesis in quinaprilat-treated rabbits similar to that observed for rhVEGF and superior to that observed with either captopril or no drug (controls). Residual ACE activity was equivalent for the captopril and quinaprilat groups in plasma (42.54+/-0.03% versus 41.53+/-0.02%, P=NS) but not in tissue, where quinaprilat lowered ACE activity significantly (P<0.01) compared with captopril (13% versus 61%).",

We previously found that short-period infusion of 2.0 microg/kg/min of AT-II enhanced tumor targeting of MAb without an impact on normal tissue distribution. In this study, we aimed to optimize the manipulation with these agents, and examine the possible mechanism of their effects on MAb distribution. Effect of the manipulation on tissue circulation was assessed in mice bearing colon cancer xenografts by 201Tl and 99mTc-human serum albumin (HSA) as markers of tissue blood flow and tissue blood volume and/or vascular permeability. A dose finding study of enalapril ranging from 3 to 300 microg showed that 30 microg of enalapril in combination with AT-II infusion produced the best improvement in tumor uptake of 99Tc-HSA without altering 201Tl distribution, suggesting that the increase of vascular permeability was caused by enalapril. AT-II infusion for longer than 1 h affected renal blood flow and caused subcutaneous edema. Tumor uptake of (111)In-A7, a murine IgG1, was 1.62-fold improved 72 h postinjection (P < 0.001) and intratumoral distribution became uniform with 2.0 microg/kg/min of AT-II for 1 h and 30 microg of enalapril. Vessels in manipulated tumors were distended even 48 h after the cessation of AT-II infusion. In conclusion, it was suggested that persistent distension of tumor vessels and the increase of diffusive extravasation of MAb caused by short-period-induced hypertension and inhibition of bradykinin degradation produced favorable effect for the MAb distribution in tumors.",

Each dose of CAP induced a sharp and rapid decrease in blood pressure (maximum, 1.5-2 h); with PER, the decrease was gradual (maximum, 6 h) and variation was less marked. However, at 36 h, the decrease in blood pressure versus baseline was similar on both treatments. Over the 36-h period, there were 22 (3%) dropouts due to marked orthostatic hypotension (SBP, <90 mm Hg), and they were fewer with PER than with CAP: 16 cases in the CAP group versus six in the PER group (p = 0.036). At 36 h, heart rate was lower with CAP than with PER: 75.2 versus 77.5 beats/min, respectively (p = 0.039). As initial therapy for stabilized left ventricular systolic dysfunction, the first dose of PER (2 mg) induced a significantly smaller decrease in blood pressure than the first dose of CAP (6.25 mg); dropouts due to orthostatic hypotension were also significantly fewer with PER than with CAP.",

The measurement of intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery by B-mode ultrasound technique has been recognized as a powerful and noninvasive method to evaluate early atherosclerotic lesions. We investigated the effect of treatment with amlodipine, a powerful calcium channel blocker, on IMT. Twenty-two hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in a prospective open study. An amlodipine group (amlodipine, 5 mg; n = 11) and a control group receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 11) were studied before and 6 months after treatment. Amlodipine treatment caused a significant decrease in IMT compared with control (-0.052 +/- 0.017 vs. 0.011 +/- 0.021 mm; p < 0.05).

    "388": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is growing epidemiologic and clinical problem, and is the only common cardiovascular condition that is increasing in incidence, prevalence and mortality. During last years numerous clinical trial have been conduced evaluating the effect of various treatment procedures on clinical endpoints in patients with CHF. The major risk factor for CHF are hipertension and atherosclerotic vascular diseases, and now it is clear that aggressive treatment of hypertension and hyperlipidemia can be effective in preventing CHF. Treatment strategies for CHF are aimed at preventing and delaying progression of the disease and improving survival. In the treatment of CHF diuretics are at present the first drugs line for patients with fluid retention and are necessary to relieve symptoms but cannot halt progression or improve the prognosis of CHF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) therapy has been shown to decrease mortality and progression of CHF and should be used early in patients with left ventricular dysfunction whether they have symptomatic or asymptomatic CHF. Digoxin therapy is associated with decrease in the risk of worsening CHF irrespective of rhythm, systolic function, severity of CHF or therapy with ACE inhibitors. In patients with symptomatic CHF due to systolic dysfunction the addition of diuretics and digoxin appears to reducing worsening CHF without improving survival. Other than digoxin oral inotropic agents (amrinone, pimobendan, vesnarinone, ibopamine) increase mortality in patients with CHF and have not improved symptom status and other clinical endpoints during long-term therapy. Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate administrated in combination are less effective alternative to ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers and particular carvedilol may prolong survival and decrease worsening CHF when used in combination with digoxine, diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Beta-blockers therapy improve hemodynamics, LVEF and functional status patients with CHF and the ideal candidate for this therapy is stable patients with NYHA II-III CHF due to nonischemic cause. Calcium antagonists do not appear to be useful in patients with CHF, although amlodipine and mibefradil appears to be safe for treatment of angina or hypertension in this group. On the basis of current data, antiarrhythmic agents should not be given to patients with CHF free from arrhythmia but those with sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation amiodaron appears to be safe.",

To determine the relation of AF to survival in patients with advanced heart failure, 234 consecutive patients referred for heart transplantation evaluation from January 1993 to June 1996 were studied to determine the effect of AF on event-free survival (freedom from death, heart transplantation, or placement of a left ventricular assist device). Clinical characteristics of the study population included: age, 51 +/- 17 years; maximum exercise oxygen consumption, 14.2 +/- 5.3 ml/kg/min; left ventricular ejection fraction, 24 +/- 11%; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, 23 +/- 9 mm Hg; and ischemic etiology, 52%. Medical therapy included: diuretics (86%), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (80%), digoxin (80%), and anticoagulation therapy (72%). Mean duration of follow-up was 1.1 +/- 1.0 years. Sixty-two patients (27.4%) had AF. One-year event-free survival of the study population was 48%. No difference in event-free survival between patients with and without AF was observed. Univariate predictors of decreased event-free survival included: (1) advanced New York Heart Association class; (2) higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; (3) lower cardiac index; (4) lower maximum exercise oxygen consumption; (5) use of inotropic therapy; and (6) greater pulmonary artery systolic pressure. By multivariate analysis, independent predictors of decreased event-free survival included advanced New York Heart Association class (p <0.002) and higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0.02). Thus, AF in patients with advanced heart failure is not associated with decreased event-free survival.",

    "403": "Accelerated coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of late mortality following cardiac transplantation. The vascular lesions are characterized by myointimal proliferation and perivascular mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates. Platelet-activating factor (PAF, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) is a potent phospholipid mediator produced by inflammatory cells and activated endothelial cells. Angiotensin II is known to activate phospholipase A2, a critical enzyme in PAF synthesis. Using a rat heterotopic cardiac transplant model known to induce graft CAD, we previously reported that chronic administration of captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, reduces intimal proliferation and maintains luminal patency. The purpose of the current study was to determine if captopril regulates vascular remodeling by suppressing PAF synthesis and whether administration of a PAF antagonist ameliorates graft CAD. Captopril was found to decrease levels of PAF and PAF-like compounds as well as reduce intimal lesions, decrease cellular rejection grade, and diminish allograft heart weights. Treatment with a PAF antagonist significantly decreased proliferation of the intimal component of the vasculopathy and caused regression of the cardiac hypertrophy, but had no significant effect on cellular rejection. In contrast, untreated animals had elevated plasma PAF levels, elevated heart weights, and severe myointimal proliferation with luminal stenosis 21 days post-transplantation. These observations suggest that graft CAD is mediated, in part, by PAF and PAF-like compounds, and suppression of endogenous PAF may prevent cardiac allograft vasculopathy.",

    "409": "Insulin sensitivity of kininogen-deficient rats was compared with that of normal rats using euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic glucose clamping. Anaesthetized animals were infused with 2-50 mU kg-1 min-1 of insulin and the glucose infusion rates needed to maintain euglycaemia were determined. Maximum glucose uptake, insulin sensitivity index and insulin clearance were reduced in kininogen-deficient rats. Captopril increased the amount of glucose needed to maintain euglycaemia during infusion of 2 and 10 mU kg-1 min-1 of insulin in normal rats, but had no effect in kininogen-deficient rats. Anaesthetized rats of both strains were given an intraperitoneal injection of glucose and the evolution of blood glucose was followed for 120 min. The peak increase was higher in kininogen-deficient rats. Similar larger increases in blood glucose were observed after glucose injection in normal rats previously treated with HOE 140, a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. After glucose injection, plasma insulin increased in both groups of rats but reached lower levels in kininogen-deficient animals. These results suggest that bradykinin is involved not only in the clearance of glucose and insulin by the tissues during insulin infusion but also that bradykinin can affect the release of insulin after a glucose load.", 
    "410": "The A-type K+ current (IA) of superior cervical ganglion neurons acutely isolated from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was compared under whole cell voltage clamp. Activation parameters were similar in each strain. Steady-state inactivation was shifted approximately -6 mV in SHR, where one-half inactivation occurred at -81 mV vs. -75 mV in WKY rats. The shift was not present in prehypertensive SHR but remained in adult enalapril-treated SHR and, therefore, may represent a primary alteration of IA properties. IA amplitudes evoked from physiological potentials were similar, despite inactivation of a greater fraction of the current in the SHR. Comparing maximal IA densities revealed that current density is elevated in the SHR, which compensates for the inactivation shift. Current density decreased with age in WKY neurons but did not significantly decline in SHR neurons unless hypertension was prevented with enalapril. Thus adult SHR neurons may retain a high IA density as an adaptive response to offset potential hyperexcitability resulting from the hyperpolarized IA inactivation.", 
    "411": "Using extracellular electrophysiological recording in an in vitro slice preparation, we investigated whether ANG I can be locally converted to the functionally active ANG II within the rat subfornical organ (SFO). ANG I and ANG II (10(-8)-10(-7) M) excited approximately 75% of all neurons tested with both peptides (n = 25); the remainder were insensitive. The increase in firing rate and the duration and the latency of the responses of identical neurons, superfused with equimolar concentrations of ANG I and ANG II, were not different. The threshold concentrations of the ANG I- and ANG II-induced excitations were both 10(-9) M. Inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme by captopril (10(-4) M; n = 8) completely blocked the ANG I-induced excitation, a 10-fold lower dose was only effective in two of four neurons. The AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (10(-5) M; n = 6) abolished the excitation caused by ANG I and ANG II. Subcutaneous injections of equimolar doses of ANG I and ANG II (200 microliters; 2 x 10(-4) M) in water-sated rats similarly increased water intake by 2.4 +/- 0.5 (n = 16) and 2. 7 +/- 0.4 ml (n = 20) after 1 h, respectively. Control rats receiving saline drank 0.07 +/- 0.06 ml under these conditions. Pretreatment with a low dose of captopril (2.3 x 10(-3) M) 10 min before the injection of ANG I caused a water intake of 2.8 +/- 0.5 ml (n = 10), whereas a high dose of captopril (4.6 x 10(-1) M) suppressed the dipsogenic response of ANG I entirely (n = 11). These data provide direct functional evidence for an SFO-intrinsic renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and underline the importance of the SFO as a central nervous interface connecting the peripheral with the central RAS.", 
    "412": "Recent evidence from our laboratory and others suggests that nitric oxide (NO) is a modulator of in vivo and in vitro oxygen consumption in the murine and canine heart. Therefore, the goal of our study was twofold: to determine whether NO modulates myocardial oxygen consumption in the nonhuman primate heart in vitro and to evaluate whether the seemingly cardioprotective actions of amlodipine may involve an NO-mediated mechanism. Using a Clark-type O2 electrode, we measured oxygen consumption in cynomologous monkey heart at baseline and after increasing doses of S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP; 10(-7)-10(-4) M), bradykinin (10(-7)-10(-4) M), ramiprilat (10(-7)-10(-4) M), and amlodipine (10(-7)-10(-5) M). SNAP (-38 +/- 5.8%), bradykinin (-19 +/- 3.9%), ramiprilat (-28 +/- 2.3%), and amlodipine (-23 +/- 4.5%) each caused significant (P < 0.05) reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption at their highest dose. Preincubation of tissue with nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (10(-4) M) blunted the effects of bradykinin (-5.4 +/- 3.2%), ramiprilat (-4.8 +/- 5.0%), and amlodipine (-5.3 +/- 5.0%) but had no effect on the tissue response to SNAP (-38 +/- 5.8%).

To examine an alteration of circulating TNF-alpha concentration in patients with severe chronic heart failure after improving heart function and investigate the influence of agents on circulating TNF-alpha concentrations, we measured the plasma levels of TNF-alpha by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay in 31 patients and evaluated their heart functions before and after 72 h of therapy. The results showed that circulating TNF-alpha concentrations significantly decreased after therapy (from 124.36+/-14.85 pg/ml to 93.84+/-13.57 pg/ml, P<0.001). The circulating TNF-alpha concentrations of patients (n = 22) whose heart function was improved one class or more after therapy declined significantly (from 127.51+/-20.78 pg/ml to 91.54+/-18.56 pg/ml, P<0.01) but this situation did not exist in patients (n = 9) whose heart functions had no or little improvement.

No statistical significance of change of TNF-alpha concentration was found in patients in group B or group C, although a tendency of decline existed (from 119.92+/-34.72 pg/ml to 84.33+/-30.70 pg/ml and from 123.83+/-19.50 pg/ml to 96.37+/-16.62 pg/ml, respectively). These findings support that decreased plasma TNF-alpha level accompanies the improvement of heart function. This phenomenon may be explained by the special abilities of agents, such as ACEI and milrinone, to inhibit the TNF-alpha production.", 
    "414": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a critically important determinant in the pathophysiologic processes that lead to progression of heart failure and sudden death. Angiotensin II, acting at the specific angiotensin receptor (AT1-R), activates a series of intracellular signaling sequences which are ultimately expressed within the cardiovascular system as vasoconstriction and associated vascular hypertrophy and remodeling. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition leads to increases in the vasodilatory peptides bradykinin and substance P and at least an initial reduction in angiotensin II concentrations. AT1-R blocking drugs prevent access of angiotensin II to the AT1-R and thus prevent cellular activation. ACE inhibitors have clearly been demonstrated through a large number of clinical trials to increase survival in congestive heart failure, primarily by reducing the rate of progression of left ventricular dilatation and decompensation. However, this beneficial effect diminishes over time. Preliminary short-term clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of AT1-R blocking drugs in the treatment of heart failure have suggested that they elicit similar hemodynamic and neuroendocrine effects as do the ACE inhibitors. The combination ACE inhibitors and AT1-R blocking drugs offer the theoretical advantage of increasing bradykinin while blocking the actions of angiotensin II, and thus possibly show a synergistic effect. Again, preliminary studies have yielded encouraging results that are difficult to interpret because neither ACE inhibitor nor the AT1-R blocking drug doses were titrated to tolerance. Pharmacological manipulation of the RAAS has led to better understanding of its role in heart failure and improved clinical outcomes.", 
    "415": "Nitrates have been widely used in the treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Although the use of these drugs has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, multiple studies have shown their favorable effects. Organic nitrates have been shown to have a beneficial effect on ischemia, hemodynamic profile, magnitude of a mitral regurgitation, endothelial function, and cardiac remodeling. These drugs, when used in combination with hydralazine, have improved exercise capacity and survival. Recent studies have shown that the use of nitrates in patients already treated with standard heart failure therapy, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, resulted in hemodynamic improvement, marked enhancement of exercise tolerance, reduction of left ventricular size, and augmentation of systolic function. These data suggest a role for organic nitrates as an adjunctive therapy to ACE inhibitors in patients with chronic heart failure and for nitrates in combination with hydralazine as an alternative treatment in patients who are intolerant to ACE inhibitors.", 
    "416": "The purpose of this study was to analyze whether long-term treatment with the nonselective beta-adrenergic blocking agent carvedilol may have beneficial effects in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), who are poor responders in terms of left ventricular (LV) function and exercise tolerance to chronic treatment with the selective beta-blocker metoprolol.", 
    "417": "Although metoprolol has been proven to be beneficial in the majority of patients with heart failure, a subset of the remaining patients shows long-term survival without satisfactory clinical improvement.",

    "421": "Kinins are peptide hormones that can exert a significant influence on the regulation of blood pressure and vascular tone due to their vasodilatatory, natriuretic and growth modulating activity. Their cardiovascular involvement in physiological and pathophysiological situations has been studied intensively since inhibitors for angiotensin I-converting enzyme and selective receptor antagonists have become available for pharmacologically potentiating or inhibiting kinin-mediated reactions. Molecular biological analysis and the establishment of genetically modified animal models have also allowed newer information to be acquired on this subject. In this review, the components and cardiovascularly relevant mechanisms of the kinin-kallikrein system shall be described. Organ-specific effects concerning the kidneys, the vascular system, the heart and nervous tissue shall also be illustrated. On this issue, the physiological functions and pathophysiological implications of the kinin-kallikrein system should be clearly distinguished from the many, mostly endothelium-mediated protective effects which occur during ACE inhibition due to the potentiation of kinin effects. Finally, a view shall also be cast upon newly discovered targets of action, which could be exploited for therapeutically altering the kinin-kallikrein system.", 
    "422": "Renal interstitial expansion is now considered a useful marker of progression of several nephropathies. This study describes a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the effects of Perindopril (4 mg/d) on kidney structure and function over 2 yr in 26 type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria ranging from 70 to 4210 mg/d and relatively preserved GFR (creatinine clearance >60 ml/min). All patients underwent baseline renal biopsy, but four (15%) were not randomized because of the presence of nondiabetic nephropathy. The remaining 22 were randomized ( 11 to Perindopril [PE], 11 to placebo [PO]), and 19 (9 PE, 10 PO) underwent follow-up biopsy at 2 yr. BP was controlled equally in both groups throughout. Proteinuria increased in PO patients (+1562 mg/d) but declined in PE patients (-156 mg/d) (P < 0.05). Morphometric analysis was performed by light microscopy using a Biocom computer. Over the 2 yr, mean cortical interstitial fractional volume identical at baseline increased significantly in PO patients (31.7 +/- 5.3 versus 40.2 +/- 11.1%; P = 0.001) but was unchanged in PE patients (33.8 +/- 4.9 versus 34.7 +/- 6.6%; P = 0.50). It is concluded that: (1) nondiabetic nephropathy is present in approximately 15% of albuminuric type 2 diabetic patients; and (2) Perindopril prevents interstitial expansion in hypertensive patients with biopsy-proven diabetic glomerulopathy. These results support a role of angiotensin II in the progression of interstitial changes in type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.", 
    "423": "In this review angiotensin II receptor antagonists (Angiotensin antagonists are discussed on the efficacy and safety in the treatment of essential hypertension. Angiotensin antagonists are more complete renin angiotensin system blockade, and are potent as ACE inhibitors, but they have rarely troublesome dry cough specific to ACE inhibitors. Angiotensin antagonists have demonstrated an excellent tolerability profile. Angiotensin antagonists will have potentially greater protection from end-organ damage, since they have provided end-organ protection in animal experiments. These agents will be considered for first-line therapies in very near future.", 
    "424": "Recent clinical studies have established an important role of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) as a tool for renal protection. Although angiotensin receptor antagonists (AII-A) share the common property with ACE-I with regard to blockade of angiotensin activity via angiotensin type 1 receptors (AT1), AII-A is also reported to stimulate AT2 that plausibly activates nitric oxide production within renal medulla and augments synthesis of vasodilatory P450-metabolites in renal afferent arterioles. In contrast, AII-A is reported to have no effect on bradykinin activity. Results obtained in experimental animals indicate that AII-A effectively prevents the progression of renal injury. Several clinical studies are in progress, and the preliminary results suggest that AII-A has potent renal protective action in a variety of renal disorders.", 
    "425": "Since 1) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems play an critical role in the development and progression of chronic heart failure, and 2) inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEIs) are proved to be effective for the treatment of chronic heart failure, angiotensin II receptor antagonists may be more effective than ACEIs. This is because angiotensin II receptor antagonists can inhibit the effects of angiotensin II via ACE-independent pathways, e.g., chymase. On the other hand, ACEIs can increase bradykinin, and thus, nitric oxide, which may cause potent cardioprotection. Therefore, angiotensin II receptor antagonists and ACEIs may mediate cardioprotection via different mechanisms, which may hint the combination therapy of both drugs in the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists may open a new era for the treatment of chronic heart failure.", 
    "426": "Losartan is a potent non-peptide, selective angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist. Losartan has been worldwide marketed as the first orally active AT1 receptor antagonist with once-daily dosing for treatment of hypertension. In a study of patients with heart failure, the mortality appeared to be lower with losartan than with the ACE inhibitor captopril. In healthy subjects, losartan produced a dose-dependent reduction in serum uric acid. The mechanism of action is considered to be the inhibition of reabsorption of uric acid in the proximal tubules of the kidney. Furthermore, it was recently reported that losartan has moderate affinity for the thromboxane (TX) A2 receptor in a competitive-inhibition manner in the platelets and vascular smooth muscle. The efficacy of losartan with regard to not only AT1 receptor blockade, but also the reduction of serum uric acid and the blockade of TXA2 receptors, may be advantageous to patients with hypertension having these cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "427": "The effect of angiotensin II (A II) on cerebral arteries is variable; A II would constrict or dilate cerebral arteries depending on species, the size of vessels examined, preexisting contractile levels, and the presence of functional endothelium. Hence exogenously applied A II may increase or decrease cerebral blood flow. The physiological role played by endogenous A II is even unclear in the cerebral circulation. Endogenous A II is unlikely to modulate cerebral blood flow. However, it may play some roles in the determination of the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow, at least judging from the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Circulating A II elevates blood pressure, and promotes water and sodium intake. A II derived from the central renin-angiotensin system would play diverse roles as a neurotransmitter or a local hormone.", 
    "428": "Angiotensin (Ang) II plays a crucial role in regulation of blood pressure and proliferation of vascular tissues. Recent studies have demonstrated that the AngII-forming enzymes, ACE and chymase, are observed in heart and vascular tissues. In isolated human arteries, chymase predominantly converted Ang I to AngII rather than ACE. In hypertensive models, AngII formation by ACE in vascular tissues plays an important role in maintaining hypertension, while that by chymase hardly does. Chymase-dependent AngII formation induces vascular diseases such as neointima formation after balloon injury. AngII receptor antagonists block AngII formation by chymase in addition to ACE and may be useful for cardiovascular diseases rather than ACE inhibitors.", 
    "429": "Pharmacological blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has been found to be a safe and efficacious way to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure. The success of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has led to interest in alternative ways to block the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists are a new class of anti-hypertensive drugs that provide a specific blockade of the effects of angiotensin II. Losartan potassium, the first compound of this class, has recently been approved in Japan. It seems likely that the angiotensin receptor antagonists will be suitable to first-line therapy and use of this class for treatment of hypertension will dramatically increase in Japan because of the excellent clinical and laboratory safety profiles.", 
    "430": "Angiotensin II (AII) acts by 2 types of receptors: the ATI receptor which mediates its actions on vasoconstriction, renin (inhibition) and aldosterone (stimulation) secretions, cellular proliferation and angiogenesis and the non-AT1 (often called AT2) receptors. Mainly expressed in the embryon these latter may favor cellular differentiation and recruitment of collateral circulation. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) decrease the synthesis of All and therefore the stimulation of both receptor types whereas AT1-receptor antagonists (AT1RA) block only the stimulation of these latter and increase the stimulation of AT2 receptor since they increase the production of All secondarily to the inhibition of the feedback of renin secretion by All. Experimentally ACEI and AT1RA decrease angiogenesis and cellular proliferation and favor cellular differentiation which could explain the protective effect of ACEI against cancer suggested recently in a Scotish study. Despite of their common suppressive effect on angiogenesis AT1RA may better than ACEI protect against ischemic events specially the cerebral ones because they favor the rapid recruitment of collateral circulation. This has been demonstrated for losartan in case of abrupt ligation of the carotid in the gerbil since its previous administration protects against fatal cerebral ischemia whereas its previous administration with enalapril abolishes this protection. These data may explain why, in the CAPP trial, captopril which has prevented more effectively diabetes occurrence could not be proved superior to diuretics and/or betablocker in the prevention of myocardial infarction and specially of strokes for which exist on the contrary a suspicion of a lower protection. Therefore a comparative trial between AT1RA and ACEI in the prevention of stroke recurrence should appear as a priority for Public Health and Pharmaceutical Industry Authorities.", 
    "431": "In vitro studies of myocardial tissue suggest that angiotensin II (Ang II) may be generated by both ACE and chymase. A similar dual pathway may exist in the vasculature. We studied the effects of ACE and chymase inhibitors on the contractile response to angiotensin I (Ang I) in human resistance arteries to investigate ACE-independent generation of Ang II.", 
    "432": "Subcutaneous resistance arteries (250 to 350 microm) were obtained from gluteal biopsies from volunteers and New Zealand White rabbits and mounted on a wire myograph. Contractile ability was tested with high-potassium depolarization and norepinephrine 10 micromol/L and endothelial integrity by relaxation to acetylcholine 3 micromol/L. Cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed for Ang I in the presence of enalaprilat 1 micromol/L, chymostatin 10 micromol/L, or both inhibitors together. In the rabbit, enalaprilat completely inhibited the Ang I response. In human vessels, enalaprilat or chymostatin alone had no effect, but the combination of enalaprilat and chymostatin almost completely inhibited the response to Ang I.", 
    "433": "A dual pathway for Ang II generation exists in human resistance arteries, mediated by ACE and a chymostatin-sensitive enzyme, probably chymase. We confirm that a marked species difference exists in the mechanism of Ang II generation between the human and the rabbit. More efficacious suppression of the renin-angiotensin system may require development of novel enzyme inhibitors or combinations of currently available drugs.", 
    "434": "Ventricular remodeling refers to changes in ventricular geometry, volume, mass, and myocellular structure in response to myocardial injury or alteration in loading conditions. Although initially adaptive as a consequence of the initial damage to the myocardium, progressive ventricular remodeling is ultimately a maladaptive process that is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment with an aim to halt or reverse remodeling with mainly two classes of medications, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blockers, has been shown to improve the long-term outcome. The role of pharmacologic and surgical therapy in remodeling is evolving and may have an important impact on the development of new directions of therapy for heart failure, myocardial infarction, and hypertension.", 
    "435": "A ligation of the common bile duct (BDL) produces cholestasis and hypotension and increases the daily ingestion of sodium chloride solutions in rats. Low-dose captopril (CAP) treatment also modifies the ingestion of water and sodium in naive rats, and may do so in cholestatic rats. This study examined whether the elevated ingestion of saline by Long-Evans rats after BDL is associated with increased plasma renin activity (PRA), and whether treatment with a low dose of the angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor CAP further exacerbates fluid intake and PRA after BDL. In these experiments water and 0.3 M saline intake and PRA and plasma aldosterone (PA) were measured in naive and CAP-treated BDL and sham-ligated rats. We found that BDL elevated rats' daily saline intake 2 weeks after the ligation procedure but had no effect on PRA. CAP (0.1 mg/mL) placed in the drinking water of some BDL rats further increased saline intake. Both PA and hematocrits tended to be reduced in BDL rats, whereas PRA was elevated in both BDL and sham-ligated rats receiving CAP in the drinking water or by gavage (0.1 mg/mL in 10 mL/kg). The data suggest that the ingestion of saline by rats can be modified by BDL and CAP administration, but that exaggerated saline intake in BDL rats is not associated with excessive renin secretion.", 
    "436": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors) have been introduced more than fifteen years ago into the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction and diabetic nephropathy. The therapeutic success is related to their action in reduction of plasma and tissue angiotensin II concentrations and potentiation of endogenous kinins. They are able to improve myocardium metabolic status, prevent cardiac hypertrophy, limit myocardial infarct size, and thus prevent heart failure. Since 1987 ACE inhibitors are introduced in the clinical practice in our clinic. We introduced the therapy with lisinopril (Lopril), in 70% of patients among 2855 patients that were admitted in Coronary Care Unit in 1997 and 1998. Lisinopril was introduced as soon as the patient was admitted, together with fibrinolitic, Heparin and Aspirin therapy. Since that time we noticed decrease in postinfarction heart failure in comparison to previous years. We recommend permanent therapy with a small doses of ACE inhibitors in patients with heart infarction.", 
    "437": "The present investigation elucidates the deleterious effects of three prototypical antihypertensive drugs namely, propranolol, clonidine and captopril on the erectile physiology. In order to delineate the direct drug effects from vascular insufficiency inherent in hypertensive states, the study was conducted on a normotensive animal model. The adverse effects of these drugs were estimated as changes in sexual behaviour and intracavernous pressure response of electrical stimulation in the treated rats compared to normal age-matched controls (n = 10, each group). Copulation studies indicated significant impairment of sexual function in the groups on propranolol and clonidine. The cavernous pressure response to nerve stimulation at the end of sixteen weeks further reinforced the gross compromise on sexual function in these two treated groups. In contrast, the captopril administration produced only marginal alterations to the responses recorded. The results from this study clearly indicate that propranolol and clonidine interfere with sexual behaviour and nerve mediated response to erection whereas captopril which is devoid of significant effects on these parameters, may be a better therapeutic option.", 
    "438": "The vascular endothelium plays a key role in the control of vasomotor tone, local haemostasis and vascular wall proliferation processes. These responses are mediated by a variety of substances released from the endothelium in response to physiological stimuli, including prostacyclin, endothelin, and most importantly nitric oxide (NO). NO mediates vasodilation and furthermore inhibits platelet aggregation, expression of adhesion molecules for monocytes and adhesion of neutrophils, and it impairs growth of vascular smooth muscle cells. Risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis, such as hypercholesterolaemia, impair NO bioactivity, mainly due to an oxidative stress by superoxide radicals (O2-), which are able of rapidly inactivating endothelium-derived NO. Impaired NO bioactivity leads to unopposed paradoxical vasoconstriction of epicardial conductance vessels in response to physiological stimuli such as sympathetic activation as well as impaired vasodilator function of coronary resistance vessels. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction contributes to ischaemic manifestation of coronary artery disease. In addition, enhanced paradoxical vasoconstriction and a loss of endothelial antithrombotic activities might unfavourably modulate the course of acute coronary syndromes. Thus, the aim of therapeutic interventions is to increase NO bioavailability by either increasing NO production or decreasing O2- production in the endothelium. This goal can be reached, for example by ACE inhibitors, lipid-lowering drugs, increased shear-stress by physical exercise, oestrogens, and L-arginine, which have already been shown to improve endothelial vasodilator function. Nevertheless, it has to be determined whether ameliorated endothelial function will contribute to improved patients prognosis.", 
    "439": "We studied the role of the cardiac renin-angiotensin II system in the genesis of cardiac memory, in which T wave changes induced by ventricular pacing (VP) accumulate and persist during subsequent sinus rhythm.", 
    "440": "Anesthetized dogs were instrumented via a thoracotomy and three 20-minute runs of VP were interspersed with periods of normal sinus rhythm sufficient to permit T wave recovery to 90% of control. Memory was quantified as the change (delta) in T wave vector angle showing accumulation over the three monitoring periods. In five control dogs T wave vector = -27 +/- 49 degrees, and this shifted by 104 degrees (P < 0.05) over the three postpacing recovery periods. In seven dogs infused with the receptor blocker saralasin, five infused with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and four infused with the tissue protease inhibitor chymostatin, there were significant reductions in the incidence and the accumulation of memory. In four other experiments, we used isolated, blood-perfused canine hearts to demonstrate that VP used to induce memory alters the contractile pattern of the left ventricle.", 
    "441": "We propose that the alteration in myocardial stretch induced by pacing activates angiotensin II synthesis by cardiac cells. We propose, further that the endogenous cardiac renin-angiotensin II system (blocked by saralasin, captopril and by chymostatin) is an important contributor to the induction of memory.", 
    "442": "The aim of the present study was to assess the predictive value of captopril scintigraphy with the new renal agent 99mTc-ethylenedicysteine (99mTc-EC) for post-interventional improvement in blood pressure. Twelve patients who had persistently high blood pressure with previous demonstration of various degrees of renal artery lesion on angiography were included into the study. Baseline and captopril scintigraphies were performed on the same day at 4 hour intervals after the injection of 74 and 296 MBq of 99mTc-EC, respectively. All patients had percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and improvement in blood pressure was evaluated 3-6 months after the intervention. 99mTc-EC captopril scintigraphy successfully predicted a positive or negative outcome in 11 of 12 patients. In one patient with captopril induced renal function deterioration, scintigraphy failed to predict post-interventional response. Our preliminary findings showed that 99mTc-EC captopril scintigraphy can be used to determine patients who will benefit from revascularization.", 
    "443": "Fetal exposure to high concentrations of corticosteroids in the rat is associated with elevated blood pressure in postnatal life. In this study we have investigated indicators of corticosteroid activity in fetal spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) in order to determine whether fetal corticosteroid exposure is increased in the SHR. Placental 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) activity, which prevents maternal steroids from crossing the placenta, was not impaired in the SHR. Concentrations of amniotic fluid corticosterone were significantly decreased in the SHR compared with the WKY at fetal Day 20, but were not significantly different on fetal Days 16 or 22. This suggests that rather than increased exposure to corticosteroids in the SHR fetus corticosteroid exposure may be reduced. Expression of lung surfactant protein A (Sp-A), a gene induced in late gestation by corticosteroids, was decreased in the SHR. In addition, differences in amniotic fluid electrolyte concentrations were observed which may reflect delayed renal maturation in the fetal SHR. These data suggest that the SHR fetus is exposed to low concentrations of corticosteroids and that the late gestation rise in fetal corticosteroid may be delayed in the SHR.", 
    "444": "In a prospectively designed randomized study, we compared the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerine and intravenous enalaprilat in the out-of-hospital treatment of 46 hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema (defined as rales over both lungs and systolic blood pressure > 200 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure > 100 mg). The out-of-hospital treatment consists of oxygen (6 Ll/min) via a face mask, furosemide 80 mg i.v., opioids 10 mg s.c., and either sublingual nitroglycerine (n = 23; initial dose: 0.8 mg; repetitive application of 0.8 mg every 10 min until a cumulative dose of 3.2 mg) or intravenous enalaprilat (initial dose: 2.5 mg; repetitive application of 2.5 mg every 30 min until a cumulative dose of 10 mg). The aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a reduction of systolic blood pressure below 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg until admission to the emergency department. In the emergency room, an arterial and venous blood sample was taken to determine the respiratory (pO2, pCO2) and metabolic status (pH value; base-excess; serum lactate) of the patient. Successful antihypertensive treatment was observed in 13/23 (57%) patients of the enalaprilat group and 15/23 (65%) patients of the nitroglycerine group (p = 0.54). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission were similar in both treatment groups (systolic RR: enalaprilat: 179 [31] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 184 [38] mm Hg; p = 0.59; diastolic RR: enalaprilat: 96 [14] mm Hg; nitroglycerine: 101 [14] mm Hg; p = 0.12). No significant differences were observed between the enalaprilat and the nitroglycerine groups concerning respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission (pO2: 67 [15] vs. 64 [17] mm Hg; p = 0.50; pCO2: 46 [9] vs. 47 [13]; p = 0.75; pH value: 7.27 [0.12] vs. 7.27 [0.09]; p = 0.98; BE: -4.2 [3.7] vs. -5.7 [4.1]; p = 0.23; lactate: 4.2 [3.3] vs. 4.2 [2.7]; p = 0.98). Intravenous enalaprilat did not exhibit any advantage compared to nitroglycerine in terms of blood pressure reduction or respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission to the emergency room. We conclude that enalaprilat is no substitute for nitroglycerine in the out-of-hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema.", 
    "445": "A review of the drug class of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as well as the ARBs currently available by prescription in the United States is presented. The importance of angiotensin II production by non-angiotensin-converting enzyme (non-ACE) pathways, particularly human chymase, is discussed. Emphasis is placed on the mechanism of action of ARBs and the different binding kinetics of these agents. Although all ARBs, as a group, block the AT1 receptor, they may differ in the pharmacological characteristics of their binding and be classified as either surmountable or insurmountable antagonists. Mechanisms of surmountable and insurmountable antagonism as well as possible benefits of these blocking characteristics are discussed in relation to the various ARBs. The cardiovascular effects of activation of the two main subtypes of angiotensin receptors (AT1 and AT2) are presented. In addition to their treatment of hypertension, ACE inhibitors are recognized as being effective in the management of heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, recurrent myocardial infarctions, and renal disease. ARBs are currently indicated only for the treatment of hypertension; however, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies as well as preliminary clinical data suggest that ARBs, like ACE inhibitors, may also provide effective protection against end-organ damage in these conditions.", 
    "446": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are antihypertensive drugs that have been shown to reduce proteinuria and to slow down the progression of renal function deterioration in different models of chronic glomerular disease. Major pathogenetic features of progressive glomerular injury leading to glomerulosclerosis are mesangial cell proliferation and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) expression. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of ramipril, an ACE inhibitor, on these two potential therapeutic targets. Thus, the effect of ramipril on DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and PDGF A and B chain gene expression in fetal calf serum (FCS)-activated cultured human glomerular mesangial cells was investigated. DNA synthesis was evaluated by tritiated thymidine incorporation, cell proliferation by direct cell counting and cell viability by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). PDGF A and B chain gene expressions were studied by Northern blot and RT-PCR, respectively. In a dose-dependent manner ramipril inhibited the FCS-induced DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. This effect was not dependent upon a toxic effect as demonstrated by MTT. The antiproliferative effect of ramipril was most likely independent of its ability to inhibit ACE present in the FCS and/or expressed by the cells, since a synthetic peptide that specifically inhibits ACE, at the same molar concentrations, did not inhibit FCS-stimulated DNA synthesis. Moreover, ramipril significantly reduced FCS-induced PDGF A and B chain gene expression. Finally, ramipril completely abolished the PDGF A and B chain gene expression induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a specific protein kinase C activator, suggesting a site of action downstream of this enzyme in the mitogenic signal transduction pathway. Our study would suggest that the modulatory action of ramipril on activated mesangial cell proliferation and PDGF expression is independent of its ability to inhibit ACE and could represent an additional mechanism in the renal protective effects of this drug.", 
    "447": "We investigated whether daphnodorin A, daphnodorin B and daphnodorin C inhibited human chymase-dependent angiotensin II-forming activity. Although the structures of these compounds are very similar, daphnodorin A completely inhibited angiotensin II formation generated by chymase, while daphnodorin B partially inhibited and daphnodorin C did not. On the other hand, these daphnodorins did not affect angiotensin converting enzyme-dependent angiotensin II formation. Furthermore, these daphnodorins did not inhibit purified human tryptase, which, like chymase, is contained in mast cells. Therefore, daphnodorin A, but not daphnodorin B and daphnodorin C, may specifically inhibit the chymase-dependent angiotensin II formation, and such differences between inhibitory effects of these compounds to human chymase may be useful for the development of human chymase inhibitor.",

This prevalence of ACEI angioedema among cardiac and renal transplant patients is 24 times and 5 times higher, respectively, than that observed in the general population (0.1% to 0.2%). Reactions often appeared after prolonged ACEI use (average 19 months; range 3 days to 6.3 years). African-Americans were significantly more likely to experience ACEI-associated angioedema (P = .034), especially among the cardiac patients where 4 of 5 reactors were African-American.",

    "453": "Endothelin receptor antagonists have been proposed for the treatment of a variety of disorders in which the endothelins may act as pathogenic mediators, such as congestive heart failure, systemic and pulmonary hypertension, and cerebral vasospasm. Bosentan (Ro 47-0203) is a nonpeptide competitive antagonist, which can be a good tool for studying the endothelin system because it may be administered either acutely or chronically. It is specific for the endothelin system and blocks the actions of endothelin at both mammalian receptors (A and B). In experimental models of heart failure bosentan acts as a vasodilator and neurohormonal blocker that improves overall left ventricular performance and reduces renal dysfunction. Furthermore, in chronic studies, bosentan attenuates cardiac remodeling and significantly improves survival. In patients with chronic heart failure bosentan produces pulmonary and systemic vasodilation and may enhance conventional treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Long-term studies are being conducted to characterize the full therapeutic potential of bosentan in chronic heart failure. In experimental models bosentan reverses established pulmonary hypertension. Preclinical efficacy has also been demonstrated in essential hypertension, where bosentan can reduce blood pressure and end-organ damage. Clinical trials in hypertensive patients indicate that bosentan reduces blood pressure without heart rate increase or neurohumoral stimulation. Finally, bosentan is being considered for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bosentan reverses experimentally induced vasospasm of the basilar artery, and preliminary trials indicate that it can increase cerebral blood flow after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.", 
    "454": "The effects of perindoprilat on the morphology and dynamic properties of human erythrocytes were studied by light microscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy and spectrophotometric methods. Erythrocytes were exposed to perindoprilat at 37 degrees C for 30 and 120 min. It was shown that the drug at a concentration of 0.75 microg/ml did not cause significant changes in the structure of erythrocyte membranes. Higher doses of the drug (7.5 and 75 microg/ml) induced changes in membrane fluidity in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer, the conformation of membrane proteins, the number of SH groups and the activity of membrane-bound acetylcholinesterase (AChE). These modifications were accompanied by changes in the shape of erythrocytes and did not depend on time of incubation. Therefore, it is proposed that perindoprilat perturbs the lipid bilayer and disturbs the organization of the protein-lipid environment.", 
    "455": "The renal protective effect of antihypertensive drugs is linked to 2 mechanisms. First, reduction in blood pressure (BP) is a fundamental prerequisite common to all antihypertensive drugs. The exact definition of the level to which BP should be reduced remains to be established, although there is some evidence that BP should be reduced below 130/85 mm Hg in patients with diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies and below 125/75 mm Hg in patients with nondiabetic nephropathies and proteinuria >1 g/day. However, available data suggest that tight BP control (BP<140/80 mm Hg) can reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; NIDDM). Secondly, intrarenal actions on mechanisms such as glomerular hypertension and hypertrophy, proteinuria, mesangial cell proliferation, mesangial matrix production and probably endothelial dysfunction, which can cause and/or worsen renal failure, are relevant for the renal protective action of some drug classes. ACE inhibitors possess such properties and also seem to lower proteinuria more than other antihypertensive drugs, despite a similar BP lowering effect. Calcium antagonists likewise exert beneficial intrarenal effects, but with some differences among subclasses. It remains to be evaluated whether angiotensin II-receptor antagonists can exert intrarenal effects and antiproteinuric actions similar to those of ACE inhibitors. While primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy is still an unsolved problem. there is convincing evidence that in patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; IDDM) or 2 diabetes mellitus and incipient nephropathy ACE inhibitors reduce urinary albumin excretion and slow the progression to overt nephropathy. Similar effects have been reported with some long-acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, although less consistently than with ACE inhibitors. In patients with diabetic overt nephropathy, ACE inhibitors and nondihydropyridine calcium antagonists are particularly effective in reducing proteinuria and both drugs can slow the decline in glomerular filtration rate more successfully than other antihypertensive treatment. Available data in patients with nondiabetic nephropathies indicate that ACE inhibitors can be beneficial, principally in patients with significant proteinuria, in slowing the progression of renal failure. However, it is still unclear whether this beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors is particularly evident in patients with mild and/or more advanced renal failure and whether calcium antagonists possess a similar nephroprotective effect. Overall, data from clinical trials thus seem to indicate that ACE inhibitors and possibly calcium antagonists should be preferred in the treatment of patients with diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathies. However, further information is needed to understand renal protection.", 
    "456": "Proteinuria is one of the most potent risk factors for renal disease progression in patients with glomerular diseases. Studies in disease models have helped to delineate mechanisms leading to renal structural damage due to persistent dysfunction of the glomerular barrier to proteins, even when the primary immune or nonimmune insult to the kidney has ceased. The main focus of this review is the role of the tubular epithelial cell in the induction of interstitial inflammatory and fibrogenic reactions to ultrafiltered proteins. Antiproteinuric drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, ACEi) while preserving the integrity of the glomerular permselective barrier limit both proteinuria and protein-dependent processes which contribute to tubulointerstitial injury, and in so doing ACEi halt the progression of proteinuric nephropathies toward terminal renal failure.", 
    "457": "A case of nephrotic syndrome complicated by acromegaly is presented. The first renal biopsy specimen showed minor glomerular abnormalities with glomerular hypertrophy, corresponding with minimal change nephrotic syndrome. Corticosteroid therapy led to a partial remission, followed by frequent relapses after reduction of the drug. A diagnosis of atypical focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was made based on the second renal biopsy results 6 months after the first. We combined steroid therapy with the administration of an anticoagulant, cytotoxic agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and low-density lipoprotein adsorption. Except for the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, these medications were not effective in terms of allowing a reduction in the high dosage of steroid, which in turn threatened progressive osteoporosis and lumbar vertebrae fracture. Administering the steroid at a moderate dosage, treatment was focused on the complicating acromegaly from pituitary microadenoma. Subcutaneous injections of octreotide acetate, a somatostatin analogue, reduced proteinuria and increased urine volume. Subsequent transsphenoidal microsurgery of the adenoma resulted in the normalization of the elevated creatinine clearance and the further reduction in steroid dosage while maintaining a remission state. This is the first reported clinical case with acromegaly followed by FSGS, and it is suggested that hypersecretion of growth hormone participates in the development and progression of glomerular disease.",

Eleven hospitals were studied using two indicators: (a) assessment of left ventricular (LV) function, and (b) use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with systolic dysfunction. Baseline performance rates were obtained for 990 cases with the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) 127 for CHF discharged January 1994 to December 1994. Baseline data feedback presentations in 1995 spurred quality improvement plans with interventions such as physician education, critical care maps, and standing orders. Follow-up abstractions were performed on 612 discharges October 1995 through April 1997. The study demonstrated 12% improvement (53% to 65%, p < .01) in assessing LV function and 20% improvement (54% to 74%, p < .01) in appropriate ACE inhibitor use. Projects emphasizing Health Care Quality Improvement Program (HCQIP) principles can successfully affect health care management for the Medicare population.",

After feedback, 2,270 remeasurements were collected from October 1996 to May 1997. At remeasurement, performance improved significantly for \"ideal\" candidates (defined by the CCP) on five quality indicators--aspirin during hospitalization 88% to 93% (p < .001), thrombolytic timing 60% to 69% (p < .01), discharge aspirin 83% to 90% (p < .001), discharge beta-blockers 69% to 82% (p < .01), and calcium channel blocker avoidance 83% to 93% (p < .05).

    "460": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors play an important role in protecting various organs in patients with congestive heart failure. The mechanisms of action of ACE inhibitors in congestive heart failure are multiple and may involve important effects on endothelial function in addition to the well known hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects. Skeletal muscle fatigue can play an important role in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure, and only aggressive treatment with ACE inhibitors and exercise training can improve exercise tolerance and reduce the risk of further deterioration of cardiac function. ACE inhibitors should be introduced with caution in patients with severe heart failure and hypotension to prevent renal dysfunction. Unlike some other ACE inhibitors, perindopril seems to cause no first dose hypotension. It also appears to have a neutral effect on renal function in patients with severe congestive heart failure.", 
    "461": "Although both blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular (LV) mass at initial evaluation predict future cardiovascular risk, the actual BP and LV mass achieved over years of treatment more clearly relate to cardiovascular event rates. Intermittent compliance or noncompliance is the major reason for uncontrolled hypertension and presumably persistent LV hypertrophy. In general, drugs with rapid onset and short duration of action are not desirable because this profile may lead to large variations in BP lowering effect during actual drug intake and rapid disappearance of the antihypertensive effect with missed doses. In addition, intermittent compliance per se introduces the potential for adverse events. For drugs requiring several dose-titrations (eg, alpha1-blockers), restarting at full doses may lead to excessive drug action and symptomatic hypotension. For other drugs (eg, short acting beta-blockers or clonidine-like drugs), sudden discontinuation with intermittent compliance may lead to rebound-enhanced sympathetic responsiveness after one to two days, resulting not only in side effects, but also in adverse events, particularly in patients with (silent) coronary artery disease. The rapid onset, short acting dihydropyridines cause intermittent BP control at each dosing, particularly at higher doses. This intermittent control of BP is even more apparent at dosing intervals that are long relative to the duration of action. Thus, sympathetic activation and potential for adverse events can be anticipated at each dosing unless these drugs are being taken frequently at relatively low doses. For diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin I receptor blockers, no adverse effects have been identified with intermittent compliance. Intermittent BP control is, in general, not an appropriate approach to the management of hypertension and introduces additional risks depending on the type of antihypertensive drug. In contrast, drugs with slow onset and long duration of action provide a more consistent effect during actual drug intake and a more persistent effect during short periods of noncompliance.",

Quinapril showed highly significant improvement in subjects with one copy of the insertion allele, either the ACE-ID or the ACE-II genotype.

Synthetic estrogens and progestins, found in oral contraceptives, tend to elevate blood pressure, whereas naturally occurring estrogens, used in postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, lower it or have no effect. Women are more likely than men to be aware of their hypertension, to be treated with antihypertensive drugs, and to have their blood pressure controlled. Antihypertensive therapy induces similar blood pressure reductions in men and women. However, men experience larger reductions in total cardiovascular risk with successful treatment of high blood pressure, because their absolute risk of coronary events at baseline is so much higher. Special considerations that can dictate antihypertensive treatment choices for women include increased vulnerability to the adverse effects of some drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough, calcium channel blocker-induced edema, and minoxidil-induced hirsutism. Beta-adrenergic blockers tend to be less effective in women than in men, and diuretics are particularly useful in women because they protect against hip fracture.

There are several experimental data suggesting that this hypertrophy may also depend, at least partially, on the increase of local production of angiotensin II secondary to the activation of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system. In this study we investigated the effects of isoproterenol on the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the heart and also in the aorta and plasma. Male Wistar rats weighing 250 to 305 g were treated with a dose of (+/-)-isoproterenol (0.3 mg kg-1 day-1, N = 8) sufficient to produce cardiac hypertrophy without deleterious effects on the pumping capacity of the heart. Control rats (N = 7) were treated with vehicle (corn oil). The animals were killed one week later. ACE activity was determined in vitro in the four cardiac chambers, aorta and plasma by a fluorimetric assay. A significant hypertrophy was observed in both ventricular chambers. ACE activity in the atria remained constant after isoproterenol treatment. There was a significant increase (P < 0.05) of ACE activity in the right ventricle (6.9 +/- 0.9 to 8.2 +/- 0.6 nmol His-Leu g-1 min-1) and in the left ventricle (6.4 +/- 1.1 to 8.9 +/- 0.8 nmol His-Leu g-1 min-1). In the aorta, however, ACE activity decreased (P < 0.01) after isoproterenol (41 +/- 3 to 27 +/- 2 nmol His-Leu g-1 min-1) while it remained unchanged in the plasma. These data suggest that ACE expression in the heart can be increased by stimulation of beta-adrenoceptors. However, this effect is not observed on other local renin-angiotensin systems, such as the aorta. Our data also suggest that the increased sympathetic discharge and the elevated plasma concentration of catecholamines may contribute to the upregulation of ACE expression in the heart after myocardial infarction and heart failure.",

    "498": "Fourteen hypertensive ADPKD patients (11 men, 3 women; mean age: 40 years) were included in the study. All patients had LVH and creatinine clearance (Cer) greater than 50 ml/min/1.73 m2. The patients were followed for 7 years on enalapril therapy. The effects of enalapril on renal function, blood pressure and LVH were investigated.", 
    "499": "Baseline measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), Ccr and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) were 110 +/- 2 mmHg, 84 +/- 6 ml/min/1.73 m2 and 146 +/- 4 g/m2, respectively. After one year of enalapril therapy there was a significant decrease in MAP (94 +/- 3 mmHg, P < 0.005) which remained stable until the end of the study at 7 years (94 +/- 1 mmHg, P < 0.005 vs baseline). There was also a significant decrease in LVMI (131 +/- 6 g/m2, P < 0.05) after year 1 which continued to decrease until the end of the study reaching 98 +/- 6 g/m2 (P < 0.01 vs year 1 and baseline). Although Ccr remained stable after year 1, a significant decrease was observed after 7 years of follow-up (59 +/- 6 ml/min, P < 0.001 vs year 1 and baseline).",

    "501": "Despite their proven value in reducing morbidity and mortality in different grades of heart failure, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors continue to be underused. One reason for this is clinicians' apprehension of first-dose hypotension. We conducted a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled parallel group study to investigate the effect of various ACE inhibitors on first-dose hypotension. Eighty unselected patients were randomised into five treatment groups: placebo, captopril 6.25 mg, enalapril 2.5 mg, perindopril 2 mg and lisinopril 2.5 mg. Blood pressure was measured at baseline, half hourly for two hours and hourly for three hours after drug treatment. The maximum drops in mean arterial pressure (in mmHg +/- SD) were placebo 5.89 +/- 2.65, perindopril 5.29 +/- 2.49, enalapril 13.28 +/- 3.31, lisinopril 15.04 +/- 5.74 and captopril 16.76 +/- 5.74 (all p < 0.05 vs placebo except for perindopril). Perindopril, unlike the other ACE inhibitors studied, did not produce first-dose hypotension following its initiation in patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "502": "Dry cough is a troublesome side-effect associated with certain antihypertensive agents that act by modulating aspects of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The incidence of dry cough associated with two of these therapies, the novel All receptor antagonist telmisartan and the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, was assessed in a multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week study of 88 patients with mild to moderate hypertension who previously demonstrated ACE inhibitor-related cough. Patients received either telmisartan 80 mg, lisinopril 20 mg, or placebo once daily. Cough incidence, measured at each visit by a self-administered symptom assessment questionnaire, was significantly higher with lisinopril (60%) than with telmisartan (15.6%) or placebo (9.7%). A visual analogue scale demonstrated a similar trend for cough frequency. Thus the incidence of cough with telmisartan 80 mg is significantly less than that seen with lisinopril 20 mg and is comparable to placebo.", 
    "503": "Vasopeptidase inhibition is a new concept in cardiovascular therapy. It involves simultaneous inhibition with a single molecule of two key enzymes involved in the regulation of cardiovascular function, neutral endopeptidase (EC 24.11; NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Simultaneous inhibition of NEP and ACE increases natriuretic and vasodilatory peptides (including atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP], brain natriuretic peptide [BNP] of myocardial cell origin, and C-type natriuretic peptide [CNP] of endothelial cell origin) and increases the half-life of other vasodilator peptides including bradykinin and adrenomedullin. By simultaneously inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and potentiating the natriuretic peptide system, vasopeptidase inhibitors (VPIs) reduce vasoconstriction and enhance vasodilation, thereby decreasing vascular tone and lowering blood pressure. Omapatrilat, a heterocyclic dipeptide mimetic, is a novel vasopeptidase inhibitor and a single molecule that simultaneously inhibits NEP and ACE with similar inhibition constants. Unlike ACE inhibitors, omapatrilat demonstrates antihypertensive efficacy in low-, normal-, and high-renin animal models. Unlike NEP inhibitors, omapatrilat provides a potent and sustained antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), a model of human essential hypertension. In animal models of heart failure, omapatrilat is more effective than ACE inhibition in improving cardiac performance and ventricular remodeling and prolonging survival. Omapatrilat effectively reduces blood pressure, provides target-organ protection, and reduces morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular events in animal models. Omapatrilat is the first VPI to enter advanced USA clinical trials. Omapatrilat appears to be a safe, well-tolerated and effective antihypertensive in humans. Vasopeptidase inhibition is a novel and efficacious strategy for treating cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension and heart failure, that may offer advantages over currently available therapies.", 
    "504": "The estimated incidence of angioedema during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor treatment is between 1 and 7 per thousand patients. This potentially serious adverse effect is often preceded by minor manifestations that may serve as a warning.", 
    "505": "Although beta-adrenergic-blocking drugs suppress the renin system (RAAS), plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) responses during beta-blockade have not been defined. This study quantifies the effects of beta-blockade on the RAAS and examines its impact on prorenin processing by measuring changes in the ratio of plasma renin activity (PRA) to total renin. In normotensive (N = 14) and hypertensive (N = 16) subjects, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, PRA, plasma prorenin, plasma total renin (prorenin + PRA), ratio of PRA to total renin (%PRA), plasma Ang II, and urinary aldosterone were measured before and after 1 week of beta-blockade. Plasma renin activity, Ang II, and urinary aldosterone levels were similar for normotensive and hypertensive subjects. Plasma renin activity correlated with Ang II. Total renin, which is proportional to (pro)renin gene expression, was lower in hypertensive subjects and was inversely related to BP. Beta-blockade decreased BP and heart rate in both groups, with medium- and high-renin hypertensive subjects responding more frequently than those with low renin. Beta-blockade consistently suppressed PRA, Ang II, and aldosterone. Total renin was unchanged, thus, %PRA fell. These results indicate that beta-blockers suppress plasma angiotensin II levels, in parallel with the marked reductions in PRA and urinary aldosterone levels in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. The suppression of Ang II levels was comparable to that produced during angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. However, by reducing prorenin processing to renin, beta-blockers do not stimulate renin secretion, unlike ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists. This unique action of beta-blockers has important implications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "506": "Type 2 (noninsulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus (DM) affects about 3% of the UK population. Diabetes often coexists with a cluster of other potent cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia and increased tendency for thrombosis, and increases the risk of early death from cardiovascular causes by about threefold. Microalbuminuria or proteinuria also may be present, further increasing the risk of cardiovascular mortality. Cardiovascular risk factors must be treated aggressively in patients with Type 2 diabetes and control of blood pressure at 140/85 mm Hg or lower is a priority. The management of hypertension in patients from some ethnic groups demands special consideration because they have a high incidence of diabetes and hypertensive complications. Patients must be urged to adopt appropriate lifestyle changes in the first instance but additional drug treatment for hypertension is usually required. All the major classes of antihypertensive agents lower blood pressure in Type 2 diabetic patients but have different effects on metabolic risk factors in different ways. Low-dose thiazide diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Individually, the effects of low-dose thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers on glucose and lipid metabolism is clinically insignificant, though in combination much larger metabolic effects are seen. ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers have no, or small, beneficial effects on glucose and lipid metabolism, while the greater beneficial effects of alpha1-blockers on lipid profiles may render them especially useful in the Type 2 diabetic patient. Long-acting calcium-channel blockers and ACE inhibitors protect renal function and are suitable as first line therapy in patients with microalbuminuria or proteinuria. Until results from the current batch of randomized, placebo-controlled trials comparing different classes of antihypertensive agents are available, the choice of antihypertensive agent is difficult. Addressing overall cardiovascular risk factors, rather than hypertension alone, is essential in the management of the hypertensive Type 2 diabetic patient.", 
    "507": "The sudden conversion of a stable atherosclerotic plaque to an unstable and life-threatening atherothrombotic lesion which is known as plaque rupture is the potential mechanism for the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Accordingly, secondary prevention of ACS could be achieved with the prevention of the plaque rupture and thrombus formation. Coronary angioplasty and coronary bypass surgery have a limited value in the long-term prevention of ACS. Coronary risk factor modification is certainly the important strategy for secondary prevention. The drug treatment with lipid lowering agents, especially 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, have been proven to be effective for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. Estrogen for postmenopausal women has also been reported to be beneficial. However, calcium channel blockers except verapamil, nitrates and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not recommended for the secondary prevention of ACS.", 
    "508": "Acute coronary syndromes result from fissure, erosion or rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque. The characteristics of a vulnerable plaque include a large lipid pool, an abundance of inflammatory cells and mediators, a reduced smooth muscle cell and collagen content and a thin overlying fibrous cap. Potential therapeutic strategies at achieving plaque stabilization have targeted these features. Lipid lowering agents, beta-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and antioxidants have been shown to reduce the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, presumably through plaque stabilization. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors as well as macrolide antibiotics and gene therapy approaches show promise in achieving plaque stabilization. The evidence supporting plaque stabilization by these agents and the mechanisms by which these agents stabilize plaques are discussed in detail in this review.", 
    "509": "Long-term low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis using dextran sulfate cellulose (DSC) columns is a well tolerated treatment for drug refractory hypercholesterolemia with coronary heart disease (CHD). Hypercholesterolemic patients may benefit from LDL apheresis combined with cholesterol lowering drug therapy in terms of the prevention of the progression of atherosclerosis, stabilization of atheromatous plaque, and reduction of cardiac events. The major adverse reaction of LDL apheresis is temporal hypotension caused by hypovolemia or vasovagal reactions due to extracorporeal circulation. Anaphylactoid reactions in patients administered angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) are other dextran sulfate cellulose column related adverse reactions, which must be carefully prevented by ceasing the administration of ACE-I before LDL apheresis treatment. ACE-I must not be administered to patients undergoing LDL apheresis.", 
    "510": "Strategically located between the circulating blood and the vascular smooth muscle, endothelial cells release numerous vasoactive substances that regulate the function of vascular smooth muscle and circulating blood cells. Important endothelium-derived vasodilators are prostacyclin, bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO) and, independent of the former, endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. In particular, NO inhibits cellular growth and migration. In concert with prostacyclin, NO exerts potent antiatherogenic and thromboresistant properties by preventing platelet aggregation and cell adhesion. These effects are counterbalanced by vasoconstrictors, angiotensin II and endothelin-1, both of which exert prothrombotic and growth-promoting properties. In hypertension, elevated blood pressure transmits into cardiovascular disease by causing endothelial dysfunction. Hence, modern therapeutic strategies in human hypertension focus on preserving or restoring endothelial integrity. Calcium antagonists counteract angiotensin II and endothelin-1 at the level of vascular smooth muscle by reducing the inflow of Ca2+ and facilitating the vasodilator effects of NO. Besides inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors diminish the inactivation of bradykinin, leading to an augmented release of NO. Newly developed vasopeptidase inhibitors induce potent antihypertensive effects in low-, normal-, and high-renin models of hypertension, not only because of the decreased breakdown of natriuretic peptides, but also because of the inhibition of endothelin-1 generation. Furthermore, experimental studies suggest that endothelin antagonists effectively lower blood pressure and prevent target-organ damage in salt-sensitive forms of hypertension. Further clinical studies are already underway to examine whether restoring endothelial dysfunction results in a clinical benefit in hypertension.", 
    "511": "The awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension has risen steadily over the past three decades, until the early 1990s. However, blood pressure control to < 140/90 mmHg is attained in fewer than 25% of all hypertensive patients and fewer than 50% of drug-treated hypertensive patients, except for white women. Two special populations, African-Americans and diabetics, share several important attributes. First, they both have a high prevalence of hypertension, including stage 3 hypertension (as defined by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of Hypertension VI: > or =180/110 mmHg), relative to other subgroups. African-Americans have an approximate 8% prevalence of stage 3 hypertension, and elevated systolic blood pressure is highly prevalent among diabetic people, particularly older African-American women. Second, both groups have high levels of blood-pressure-related target-organ damage, which contributes to their inordinately high absolute risk for cardiovascular disease complications (i.e. stroke, congestive heart failure, renal failure) at a given level of blood pressure. Moreover, the reduced natriuretic capacity common to each group contributes to the attenuated efficacy of antihypertensive drug monotherapy, particularly for drug classes other than diuretics and calcium antagonists. These two special populations are also typically salt-sensitive, an intermediate blood pressure phenotype that raises blood pressure medication requirements. This phenomenon has been associated with an attenuation in the normal nocturnal fall in blood pressure. The high absolute risk for cardiovascular disease among diabetics led to the formulation of more aggressive treatment recommendations for antihypertensive drug therapy. In diabetics, blood pressure therapy is initiated at blood pressures > or = 130/85 mmHg, and treatment goals are at least to this level, unless proteinuria is > or = 1g/day (in which case the goals are < 125/75 mmHg). The more aggressive treatment targets for diabetics will not be reached with most currently available single antihypertensive agents in many African-Americans. While at best only 50-60% of hypertensive patients can be controlled with single drug therapy, that percentage falls dramatically in persons with stage 3 hypertension and renal insufficiency, thereby necessitating the use of combination drug therapy. Treatment alone is not enough; treatment to goal blood pressure is an essential first step towards optimal target-organ protection. While circulating levels of renin are suppressed, in general, in these special populations, each group manifests an inordinate burden of blood-pressure-related target-organ damage that has been linked to excessive levels of angiotensin II or a reduced bradykinin and nitric oxide tissue effect. The renin-angiotensin-aldo-sterone-kinin system is therefore an attractive therapeutic target that might conceivably provide target-organ protection over and above that attributable solely to lowering the blood pressure.", 
    "512": "The Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) Study had two objectives: (1) to define the optimal target blood pressure when treating hypertensive patients (i.e. the level of blood pressure associated with the lowest incidence of major cardiovascular events such as fatal and non-fatal stroke and myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular mortality); and (2) to assess the effect of a low dose of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) compared with placebo on major cardiovascular events.", 
    "513": "The HOT study recruited 18 790 hypertensive subjects aged 50 to 80 years with diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 100 and 115 mmHg (mean DBP 105 mmHg). Subjects were randomly assigned to be treated with the goal of reaching one of three target DBPs: < or = 90 mmHg (n = 6264), < or = 85 mmHg (n = 6264), or < or = 80 mmHg (n = 6262) using felodipine as initial therapy with the addition of other agents according to a 5-step regimen. In addition, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either 75 mg/day aspirin (n = 9399) or placebo (n = 9391).",

The incidence of all major cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular mortality) decreased, although not significantly, in relation to the randomized target blood pressure. There were 84, 64, and 61 fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions in the < or = 90 mmHg, < or = 85 mmHg, and < or = 80 mmHg groups, respectively (P = 0.05). The overall effect of aspirin on cardiovascular events was positive, most noticeably on fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarctions; aspirin reduced events by 36%. There were seven fatal episodes of bleeding (two cerebral) in the aspirin group compared with eight (three cerebral) in the placebo group, and 129 versus 70 non-fatal major episodes of bleeding in the two groups, respectively. The lowest incidence of all major cardiovascular events combined was found at an achieved DBP of 82.6 mmHg and at an achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 138.5 mmHg. In the subgroup with diabetes mellitus at baseline (n = 1501), the effect of intensive lowering of blood pressure was especially noticeable.",

The optimal protection against combined major cardiovascular end-points was observed in the range 80-85 mmHg for DBP and in the range 130-140 mmHg for SBP. It is worth noting that 92% of all subjects reached a DBP of < or = 90 mmHg and that side-effects gradually declined from 16.9% at 3 months to 2.2% at the end of the study. A substudy showed that quality of life was linked to the level of blood pressure obtained: the lower the blood pressure, the better the quality of life.", 
    "516": "The effect of isradepin, ramipril, ednyt, and beta-adrenoblockers on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and free-radical oxidation in patients with insulin-independent diabetes mellitus was studied. Isradepin caused an increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDLP) in the blood serum and the content of esterified cholesterol in HDLP, and reduced the arterogenicity coefficient. Rampiril reduced the basal level of glycemia and insulin. Treatment with ednyt lead to increase in the content of HDLP and the content of free cholesterol in them. In the course of treatment isradepin normalized chemoluminescence of the serum and urine, rampiril that of serum, and beta-adrenoblockers the chemoluminescence of the blood. The favorable changes induced by the drugs under study allow them to be recommended for the treatment of arterial hypertension in patients with insulin-independent diabetes mellitus.",

As a result, the number of scars reduced, focal cardiosclerosis, dystrophy and hypertrophy of the cardiomyocytes were less pronounced, and the content of cellular glycogen increased. The cardioprotective effect was attended with a normalizing influence on the renin-angiotensin system parameters which were significantly changed after experimental damage to the myocardium: perindopril restored angiotensin I clearance and the level of angiotensin II production in the lungs.", 
    "518": "The current study tested the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase expression are subject to different regulatory processes in the heart, as well as the lungs and kidneys and, as a result, have an important effect on the efficacy of ACE inhibitor treatment in modulating tissue angiotensin II (ANG II) levels in heart failure. A total of 18 dogs underwent the induction of mitral regurgitation and were followed for 5 months. Eleven dogs were untreated and seven received the ACE-inhibitor ramipril at a dose of 10 mg PO BID. Seventeen dogs underwent a sham-operation: six of these dogs were treated with ramipril for 3 months (10 mg PO BID) and 11 were untreated and followed for 3 months prior to sacrifice. In mitral regurgitation dogs, ANG II levels were increased >2-fold in left ventricle, lungs, and kidney, but were normalized with ACE inhibitor-treatment only in the left ventricle. In the left ventricle and lungs steady state ACE mRNA levels and ACE activities were increased 2-fold in treated and untreated mitral regurgitation dogs compared to shams (P<0.05, ANOVA). In contrast, chymase mRNA levels were decreased by >50% and chymase activity was increased in left ventricle (LV) of mitral regurgitation dogs (P<0.05). Neither chymase mRNA nor chymase activity could be detected in the kidney; however, kidney ACE mRNA and ACE activity were significantly upregulated in treated and untreated mitral regurgitation dogs (P<0. 05). These results suggest that ACE and chymase expression are regulated differentially in the dog in response to chronic mitral regurgitation and ACE inhibitor treatment. Further, these responses, as well as regulation of ANG II formation, are organ specific.",

    "529": "In response to humoral and mechanical stimuli, the myocardium adapts to increased work load through hypertrophy of individual muscle cells. Myocardial hypertrophy is characterized by an increase in cell size in the absence of cell division and is accompanied by changes in gene expression. Angiotensin II (ANG II), the effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), regulates volume and electrolyte homeostasis and is involved in cardiac and vascular growth in rats. In this review, the role of RAS on the myocyte protein synthesis (myocyte hypertrophy) and on the induction of gene expression will be discussed in rat cardiomyocytes in culture. The traditional RAS can be considered as a system in which circulating ANG II is delivered to target tissues or cells. However, a local RAS has also been described in cardiac cells and evidence has been accumulated for autocrine and/or paracrine pathways by which biological actions of ANG II can be mediated. These actions of ANG II are primarily mediated through ANG II receptors of the subtype I (AT1-R). When evaluating the effects of ANG II in situ, both changes in circulating levels and local production have to be taken into account. Discrepant findings on the in vitro effect of ANG II on the protein synthesis in cardiac myocytes are described and can be at least partly be attributed to methodological problems such as assay of the de novo protein synthesis, isolation and the separation procedure of cardiac myocytes. The ANG II-induced hypertrophic effect also depends on the existence of non-myocytes in a cardiocyte culture. In rat cardiocytes ANG II also causes induction of many immediately-early genes (c-fos, c-jun, jun-B, Egr-1 and c-myc) and induces also late markers of cardiac hypertrophy (skeletal alpha-actin and atrial natriuretic peptide expression) and growth factors (TGF-beta1 gene expression). In vivo ANG II via AT1-R, causes not only ventricular hypertrophy, independently of blood pressure, but also a shift to the fetal phenotype of the myocardium. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ANG II receptor antagonists of the subtype I not only induce the regression, but also prevent the development of cardiac hypertrophy in experimental rat models.", 
    "530": "Hypertension has been proposed as an independent risk factor for diabetic neuropathy. In insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients suffering from neuropathy, red blood cell (RBC) Na/K ATPase is decreased. Such a decrease might be involved in the physiopathology of hypertension and therefore be the link between hypertension and neuropathy. To confirm this hypothesis, we studied 104 IDDM patients with a long duration of disease by looking at the association between neuropathy and hypertension and by comparing RBC Na/K ATPase activity in subgroups. The independent risk factors associated with neuropathy were hypertension, triglyceride level, diabetes duration and low RBC Na/K ATPase activity. Contrary to our expectations, Na/K ATPase was not decreased in hypertensive patients (294 +/- 16 nmol Pi/mg prot/h vs 303 +/- 9), but those treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor had higher RBC Na/K ATPase activity than those treated with calcium blockers (355 +/- 15 nmol Pi/mg prot/h vs 216 +/- 10). These results confirm the association between neuropathy and hypertension, on the one hand, and neuropathy and decreased Na/K ATPase, on the other, and show that hypertension in IDDM patients was not associated with decreased RBC Na/K ATPase. Moreover, ACE inhibitor treatment in IDDM patients, whether hypertensive or not, was associated with higher levels of RBC Na/K ATPase, which could account for its beneficial effect on diabetic neuropathy.", 
    "531": "Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metallopeptidase that plays a major role in blood pressure regulation. The demonstration that the hemoregulatory peptide acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro (AcSDKP) is a natural and specific substrate of the N-active site of ACE suggests that this enzyme may have a new physiological role such as the modulation of hematopoietic stem cells. In vitro studies have shown that ACE inhibitors displayed various potencies in inhibiting the degradation of different natural or synthetic substrates of ACE, among which captopril inhibits AcSDKP hydrolysis more potently than angiotensin I hydrolysis. To look for this selectivity in vivo, we investigated the pharmacodynamic effect of increasing doses of captopril (0.01-10 mg/kg) during the 90 min after i.v. administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats. Plasma and urinary AcSDKP levels were measured. The renin-angiotensin system was evaluated by measurements of ACE activity in plasma samples, using the synthetic substrate Hip-His-Leu, by determinations of plasma renin concentrations and measurements of arterial blood pressure. The results showed that captopril (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) selectively inhibited AcSDKP hydrolysis, with limited effects on the renin-angiotensin system. AcSDKP levels in plasma and urine rose to a plateau 4 times the basal level for doses more than 0.3 mg/kg. All of the parameters reflecting the renin-angiotensin system were significantly affected at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg. The present study therefore confirms that captopril can be used to protect hematopoietic stem cells during antitumor chemotherapy while having only a limited effect on cardiovascular homeostasis.",

Present results indicate that Dival, an ANGIV antagonist, reverts the facilitatory effect of ANGIV but not that of ANGII, whereas saralasin but not Dival, disrupts CSM. These findings suggest that ANGII is the endogenous angiotensin that plays a significant role in long-term memory, while the ANGIV receptor would not be encompassed in the cascade of events related to crab's CSM.",

Unless acute target organ involvement is already present, there are no compelling reasons to lower blood pressure quickly. Instead, beginning with relatively low doses of medications and slowly bringing the blood pressure to goal helps avoid troublesome medication side effects. This is especially important in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension who are susceptible to orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, and confusion, despite little change in blood pressure. Use of long-acting agents and combination medications may improve compliance with the medical regimen.", 
    "543": "The angiotensin II (A II) type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists represent a new pharmacologic class of drugs. These drugs antagonize A II induced biologic actions. Initial clinical trials suggest that these drugs are effective in the treatment of essential hypertension and hypertensive patients with renal disease. Losartan becomes the first potent, orally active and longacting nonpeptide A II receptor antagonist to be used in humans. Antihypertensive efficacy appears to be dependent on an activation of renin-angiotensin system, since bilateral nephrectomy and/or volume expansion abolishes the blood pressure lowering effect. Blood pressure is lowered without a significant change in heart rate or cardiac output. In hypertensive patient with renal disease, losartan has been reported to have no clinically important effect on glomerular filtration rate. To date, no specific AT1 antagonists' side effect has been reported. The potential widespread use of this new class of antihypertensive drugs will depend on whether AT1 receptor antagonists can be differentiated clinically from ACE inhibitors, and if such differentiation has clinically significant benefits.", 
    "544": "In the kidney and colon 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) inactivates cortisol to cortisone, thereby protecting the non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor from cortisol. Deficiency of 11beta-HSD2 results in cortisol-mediated sodium retention and hypertension, suggesting that the physiological regulation of 11beta-HSD2 in mineralocorticoid target tissues may be important in modulating sodium homoeostasis and blood pressure control. Using the human epithelial colon cell line SW-620, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme kinetic analysis indicated expression of only 11beta-HSD2 (Km for cortisol 66 nmol/l). Bradykinin (10(-8) to 10(-12) mol/l), frusemide (10(-4) to 10(-9) mol/l), benzamiloride hydrochloride (10(-5) to 10(-10) mol/l) and atrial natriuretic peptide (10(-6) to 10(-10) mol/l) had no effect on 11beta-HSD2 expression. Using a range of concentrations of angiotensin II (2x10(-8) to 2x10(-5) mol/l) a significant reduction in activity was seen but only at supra-physiological concentrations, [e.g. 2x10(-6) mol/l at 4 h pretreatment: 36.7+/-2.0 pmol cortisone. h-1.mg-1 (mean+/-S.E.M.) compared with 45.1+/-1.7 pmol.h-1.mg-1 in control; P<0.05]. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors captopril, enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril and trandolapril at 10(-7) mol/l, but not fosinopril, significantly increased 11beta-HSD2 activity after pretreatment for 16 or 24 h (P<0.05-P<0.01 compared with control). No effects were seen at 4 h pretreatment. Hydrochlorothiazide (10(-7) mol/l) significantly decreased 11beta-HSD2 activity (P<0.05 compared with control) at 4 h pretreatment. Commonly used diuretics, atrial natriuretic peptide and physiological concentrations of angiotensin II and bradykinin do not alter 11beta-HSD2 activity. In contrast, a series of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors significantly increase 11beta-HSD2 activity in vitro. This may explain how intrarenal infusions of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors increase renal sodium excretion independent of circulating concentrations of angiotensin II. The interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and 11beta-HSD2 may be an additional mechanism by which the former can lower blood pressure.", 
    "545": "A polymorphism within the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene may increase the risk of myocardial infarction in individuals previously thought to be at low cardiovascular risk. The mechanism through which it exerts this effect is unknown but may be due to increased angiotensin II-induced nitric oxide (NO) breakdown and/or reduced bradykinin-mediated NO release. We investigated whether endothelial function was different between different ACE genotypes. We performed a cross-sectional study comparing the endothelial function of the 3 genotypes (II: n=25; ID: n=31; DD: n=12). Mean+/-SD ages of the subjects were 24+/-4 (II), 25+/-6 (ID), and 25+/-6 (DD) years. We assessed the impact of the genotypes on endothelial function and found that the DD genotype was associated with a significant blunting in endothelial-dependent vasodilatation (forearm blood flow data are presented as mean+/-SD ratio of blood flow in response to 3 incrementally increasing doses of each vasoactive agent in the test arm to blood flow in the control arm; the comparison is between DD versus ID versus II; the P value is an expression of an overall difference by ANOVA, and the 95% CIs are of a pairwise comparison between genotypes): acetylcholine, 2.88+/-1.45 versus 3.81+/-1.93 versus 4.23+/-2.37 (P=0.002; 95% CI [II versus ID], -0.19 to 0.91; 95% CI [II versus DD], 0.36 to 1.80; 95% CI [ID versus DD], 0.02 to 1.42). There was also a significant difference with the endothelial-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside, with values of 2.11+/-1.00 versus 2.55+/-1.36 versus 2.75+/-1.18 (P<0.05; 95% CI [II versus ID], -0.15 to 0.51; 95% CI [II versus DD], 0.03 to 0.89; 95% CI [ID versus DD], -0.13 to 0.71), but not with verapamil. There was no effect of the ACE genotype on endothelial-dependent or -independent vasoconstrictors NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or norepinephrine. Investigating the effects of cigarette smoking on each genotype demonstrated that for II and DD genotypes, acetylcholine responses were further blunted if subjects smoked. These data demonstrate that the DD ACE genotype in a young population is associated with a blunting of stimulated endothelial NO and donated NO responses but not to non-NO vasodilators or vasoconstrictors.", 
    "546": "Short-term treatment of young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces systolic blood pressure. Renal medullary neutral lipids (RMNLs) have vasodilator properties that may explain the effects of ACE inhibition. We measured RMNL levels of SHR treated between 6 and 10 weeks of age with (1) vehicle, (2) ramipril 1 mg. kg-1. d-1, (3) the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant 0.5 mg. kg-1. d-1, or (4) icatibant 0.5 mg. kg-1. d-1 plus ramipril 1 mg. kg-1. d-1. RMNLs were quantified by oil red O fluorescence at 10 and 20 weeks of age. Systolic blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography. Ramipril reduced BP at 10 weeks of age and increased RMNLs compared with controls (0.99+/-0.07% versus 0.56+/-0. 06%, P<0.01). Icatibant alone had no significant effect on RMNLs (0.55+/-0.04%) but attenuated the increase in RMNLs by ramipril (0. 81+/-0.05%). In control SHR, the increase in BP between 10 and 20 weeks of age was associated with a significant increase in RMNLs (0.79+/-0.09%). SHR that had received ramipril had significantly lower BP than controls at 20 weeks of age, but RMNL was not significantly different (0.92+/-0.10%). Therefore, in young SHR, ACE inhibition increases RMNLs and reduces blood pressure, an effect that appears to depend on bradykinin. The changes in RMNLs at the age of 10 weeks paralleled long-term BP effects and may be involved in setting the BP track in SHR.", 
    "547": "We investigated the pathophysiological significance of adrenomedullin (AM) in the development of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH was produced by aortic banding (AB) in rats. The left ventricular weight/body weight (LV/BW) ratio, ventricular AM peptide and mRNA levels, and hemodynamics were measured at 1, 3, 7, and 21 days after the operation. Both LV/BW ratio and ventricular AM levels showed a significant increase from 1 day after the operation in the AB rats versus the sham-operated rats. Both increased in a time-dependent manner. The ventricular AM levels correlated with the LV/BW ratio (r=0.76, P<0.01). The AM mRNA levels were highly expressed at 1 day after the operation in the AB rats but showed no difference from 3 to 21 days after the operation between the AB and sham groups. The plasma AM levels showed a peak at 1 day after the operation in both groups. Then, we treated AB rats with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (quinapril) in 2 doses (1 and 10 mg. kg-1. d-1) for 21 days. The quinapril treatment attenuated similarly both the LV/BW ratio and the ventricular AM levels. We also assessed the effects of AM and hydralazine administration for 7 days on the LV/BW ratio and hemodynamics of AB rats. Both AM and hydralazine administration reduced the blood pressure by approximately 10% compared with the nontreated AB rats, but a reduction of the LV/BW ratio was observed only in the AM-treated group (P<0.05). These results suggest that ventricular AM levels are elevated by chronic pressure overload in a time-dependent manner concomitant with the extent of LVH and that AM may play a pathophysiological role in the development of LVH in chronic pressure overload.", 
    "548": "Adjuvant therapy may allow patients being treated with epoetin to derive greater clinical benefits. Iron supplementation is currently the most widely used form of adjuvant therapy; intravenous (i.v.) iron is required by the majority of haemodialysis patients receiving epoetin. Measurement of hypochromic red blood cells is the most direct way of assessing iron supply to the bone marrow. During the correction phase, a dose of i.v. iron equivalent to 50 mg/day is recommended, with the total dose not exceeding 3 g. When subclinical vitamin C deficiency is suspected, ascorbic acid may be given orally (1-1.5 g/week) or i.v. (300 mg three times weekly at the end of dialysis). The active vitamin D metabolites alfacalcidol and calcitriol may, under some circumstances, improve anaemia and reduce epoetin dosage requirements. Vitamin B6 requirements are increased during epoetin therapy, and supplementation at a dose of 100-150 mg/week is recommended. Supplementation of vitamin B12 is optional. Folic acid is supplemented routinely in haemodialysis patients, though evidence that it increases the efficacy of epoetin is limited. Low doses (2-3 mg/week) should normally be sufficient to maintain optimal folic acid stores in epoetin-treated patients, although higher doses are necessary for patients with hyperhomocysteinaemia. L-Carnitine supplementation may be appropriate in some patients with anaemia of chronic renal failure (CRF) unresponsive to, or requiring large doses of, epoetin. Androgens potentially could reduce epoetin costs in countries with limited resources, but should only be used in men older than 50 years with a remnant kidney. Recent animal studies indicate that the combination of epoetin and insulin-like growth factor 1 might be beneficial in CRF patients. High doses of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be reserved for dialysis patients who have hypertension that cannot be controlled by other agents, or who require an ACE inhibitor for treatment of heart failure.",

The role of ADP-ribosylation in mediating the effects of BFA on the structure and function of the Golgi complex was analyzed by several approaches including the use of selective pharmacological blockers of the reaction and the use of ADP-ribosylated cytosol and/or enriched preparations of the BFA-induced ADP-ribosylation substrates, GAPDH and BARS-50. A series of blockers of the BFA-dependent ADP-ribosylation reaction identified in our laboratory inhibited the effects of BFA on Golgi morphology and, with similar potency, the ADP-ribosylation of BARS-50 and GAPDH. In permeabilized RBL cells, the BFA-dependent disassembly of the Golgi complex required NAD+ and cytosol. Cytosol that had been previously ADP-ribosylated (namely, it contained ADP-ribosylated GAPDH and BARS-50), was instead sufficient to sustain the Golgi disassembly induced by BFA. Taken together, these results indicate that an ADP-ribosylation reaction is part of the mechanism of action of BFA and it might intervene in the control of the structure and function of the Golgi complex.",

Enalaprilat significantly prevented the rapid degradation of BK in every tissue type and at every sampling time. Moreover, omapatrilat significantly increased the t1/2 of BK compared with enalaprilat in every tissue type and at every sampling time. These results demonstrate that experimental MI followed by left ventricular dysfunction significantly modifies the metabolism of exogenous BK by heart membranes. ACE and NEP participate in the degradation of BK since both enalaprilat and omapatrilat have potentiating effects on the t1/2 of BK.", 
    "573": "We have examined the effects of the synthetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, batimastat (BB-94) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, on metalloproteinase activity of murine Lewis-lung-carcinoma cells (3LL) in vitro, and on local growth and lung metastasis of the same tumor implanted intramuscularly in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The effect of BB-94 and captopril on the survival of the 3LL-tumor-bearing mice was also examined. Here we report that captopril treatment resulted in decreased transcription and protein levels of gelatinase A by 3LL cells. Both BB-94 and captopril also prevented substrate degradation by gelatinase A and B released in conditioned medium by cultured cells. Treatment of tumor-bearing animals with BB-94 (i.p.) or captopril (in drinking water) resulted in significant inhibition of the mean tumor volume (25 and 33% respectively) and of the mean lung metastasis number (26 and 29% respectively). When both agents were given, they acted in synergy, resulting in 51 and 80% inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. The survival time of the mice treated with both BB-94 and captopril was also significantly longer compared with the groups treated with each agent alone or with the vehicle. Our data support the hypothesis of an essential role of metalloproteinase(s) in the metastatic process. Moreover, blockade of invasion, angiogenesis and other processes mediated by metalloproteinases may underlie the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effect of BB-94 and captopril and their combination. It is conceivable that this combination could be tested in selected clinical conditions as an adjuvant modality to cytotoxic therapy.", 
    "574": "We studied in anesthetized rats whether aminopeptidase P (AMP) may be involved in bradykinin (BK) metabolism and responses. For this we inhibited AMP with the specific inhibitor apstatin (Aps). Studies were done with Aps alone or together with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril (Lis). Aps increased the vasodepressor response to an intravenous bolus of BK (400 ng/kg): vehicle, -3.0 +/- 0.7 mmHg; Aps, -7.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg (P < 0.01 vs. vehicle); Lis, -23.8 +/- 1.8 mmHg; Aps + Lis, -37.5 +/- 1.9 mmHg (P < 0.01 vs. Lis). Aps did not affect the vasodepressor response to BK given into the descending aorta. Plasma BK increased only in Aps + Lis-treated rats (in pg/ml): control, 48.0 +/- 1.4; Lis, 57.5 +/- 7.6; Aps + Lis, 121. 8 +/- 30.6 (P < 0.05 vs. control or Lis), whereas in rats infused with BK (400 ng. kg-1. min-1 for 5 min), Aps increased plasma BK (in pg/ml): control, 51.9 +/- 2.5; Aps, 83.5 +/- 20.5; Lis, 725 +/- 225; Aps + Lis, 1,668 +/- 318 (P < 0.05, Aps vs. control and Lis vs. Aps + Lis). In rats with aortic coarctation hypertension, the acute antihypertensive effects of Aps plus Lis were greater than Lis alone (P < 0.01). Hoe-140, a BK B2-receptor antagonist, abolished the difference. We concluded that in the rat AMP contributes to regulation of BK metabolism and responses.", 
    "575": "It has been shown that glomerular angiotensin II (ANG II) receptors are downregulated and protein kinase C (PKC) is activated under diabetic conditions. We, therefore, investigated ANG II receptor and PKC isoform regulation in glomerular mesangial cells (MCs) under normal and elevated glucose concentrations. MCs were isolated from collagenase-treated rat glomeruli and cultured in medium containing normal or high glucose concentrations (5.5 and 25.0 mM, respectively). Competitive binding experiments were performed using the ANG II antagonists losartan and PD-123319, and PKC analysis was conducted by Western blotting. Competitive binding studies showed that the AT1 receptor was the only ANG II receptor detected on MCs grown to either subconfluence or confluence under either glucose concentration. AT1 receptor density was significantly downregulated in cells grown to confluence in high-glucose medium. Furthermore, elevated glucose concentration enhanced the presence of all MC PKC isoforms. In addition, PKCbeta, PKCgamma and PKCepsilon were translocated only in cells cultured in elevated glucose concentrations following 1-min stimulation by ANG II, whereas PKCalpha, PKCtheta, and PKClambda were translocated by ANG II only in cells grown in normal glucose. Moreover, no changes in the translocation of PKCdelta, PKCiota, PKCzeta, and PKCmu were detected in response to ANG II stimulation under euglycemic conditions. We conclude that MCs grown in high glucose concentration show altered ANG II receptor regulation as well as PKC isoform translocation compared with cells grown in normal glucose concentration.", 
    "576": "Recent work from this laboratory demonstrated potent inhibition of apoptosis in human alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril [B. D. Uhal, C. Gidea, R. Bargout, A. Bifero, O. Ibarra-Sunga, M. Papp, K. Flynn, and G. Filippatos. Am. J. Physiol. 275 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 19): L1013-L1017, 1998]. On this basis, we hypothesized that apoptosis in this cell type might be induced by angiotensin II (ANG II) through its interaction with the ANG II receptor. Purified ANG II induced dose-dependent apoptosis in both the human AEC-derived A549 cell line and in primary type II pneumocytes isolated from adult Wistar rats as detected by nuclear and chromatin morphology, caspase-3 activity, and increased binding of annexin V. Apoptosis also was induced in primary rat AECs by purified angiotensinogen. The nonselective ANG II-receptor antagonist saralasin completely abrogated both ANG II- and angiotensinogen-induced apoptosis at a concentration of 50 microgram/ml. With RT-PCR, both cell types expressed the ANG II-receptor subtypes 1 and 2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The nonthiol ACE inhibitor lisinopril blocked apoptosis induced by angiotensinogen, but not apoptosis induced by purified ANG II. These data demonstrate the presence of a functional ANG II-dependent pathway for apoptosis in human and rat AECs and suggest a role for the ANG II receptor and ACE in the induction of AEC apoptosis in vivo.", 
    "577": "There is some evidence that cardiac rather than circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels contribute to the development of renovascular hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), remaining unknown the effects of antihypertensive drugs on IGF-1 levels. We have assessed here the preventive effects of enalapril, losartan, propanolol and alpha-methyldopa on left ventricle (LV) and circulating IGF-1 levels in a rat model of hypertension and LVH (Goldblatt, GB). Our results show that relative LV mass and the LV content of IGF-1 were significantly lower with all antihypertensive drugs in GB rats (p<0.001). Serum concentrations of IGF-1 were lower in GB rats treated with enalapril, alpha-methyldopa and propanolol (p<0.01), but not in those treated with losartan. These results support the hypothesis that local rather than seric IGF-1 contributes to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in the rat.", 
    "578": "The acute effects on urinary prostanoid excretion and on renal function induced by pharmacological inhibition of either the angiotensin-converting enzyme or of the cyclooxygenase system, respectively, have been studied in healthy salt-depleted women. Two experimental groups were studied during salt depletion, SD1 (n=8) and SD2 (n=6). Salt depletion was obtained by combining a low sodium chloride dietary intake (< or =60 mmol per day) with natriuretic and potassium sparing treatment. Paired studies were performed in the absence and in the presence of enalapril (SD1 group) or indomethacin (SD2 group). In both paired studies renal function was estimated by the clearance (cl.) method and the urinary concentrations of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1alpha and TXB2 were estimated by RIA during sustained hypotonic polyuria (induced by oral water load). Enalapril did not influence urinary excretion of prostanoids. Its main significant effects were: (a) a reduction in mean arterial pressure (MAP); (b) an increase in free-water cl. (C(H2O)) and a reduction in osmolar cl. (Cosm); (c) a reduction in the absolute and fractional urinary excretions of sodium and chloride; and (d) a reduction in both the plasma concentration and urinary excretion of potassium. The urinary flow rate and the creatinine cl. were not significantly affected. Indomethacin reduced urinary excretion of prostanoids and in addition it produced the following significant effects: (a) a reduction in urinary flow rate, C(H2O) and Cosm values, and in absolute and fractional urinary excretions of sodium and chloride; and (b) an increase in plasma potassium concentration. MAP, creatinine cl. and urinary potassium excretion were not significantly affected. With regard to the main parameters, both enalapril and indomethacin exerted similar effects on urinary sodium and chloride excretion but opposite effects on C(H2O) and plasma potassium concentration. In conclusion, after enalapril in a salt-depleted state, the functional expression of acute angiotensin II deprivation was partially masked by the activation of a homeostatic system responsible both for improvement in renal salt conservation and for facilitated cellular potassium uptake. After indomethacin in the same setting, the results were consistent with a differential role of prostanoids in modulating or mediating the activities of neuro-hormonal agonists.", 
    "579": "This study was designed to assess the influence of the activation status of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) on the hemodynamic effects of EXP 3174 (an angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist) and enalaprilat (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) in tachycardia-induced heart failure. Thirteen dogs were chronically instrumented to measure left ventricular (LV) pressure, its first time derivative (LV dP/dt), atrial and aortic pressures, and cardiac output. EXP 3174 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) or enalaprilat (1 mg/kg, i.v.) were administered in conscious dogs with heart failure induced by right ventricular pacing (250 beats/min, 3 weeks). EXP 3174 and enalaprilat produced significant vasodilation but the effects of EXP 3174 on mean aortic pressure (MAP), cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were only 50% of those produced by enalaprilat. When dogs were grouped according to their baseline plasma renin activity (PRA) values, in dogs with normal PRA (0.5 +/- 0.1 ng/ml/h) EXP 3174 did not produce significant change in MAP and TPR, while enalaprilat decreased significantly MAP and TPR. In contrast, in dogs with high PRA (6.7 +/- 3.2 ng/ml/h), EXP 3174 produced significant reductions in MAP and TPR, which were similar to those produced by enalaprilat. Thus, in conscious dogs with heart failure, enalaprilat is effective whether the RAS is activated or not. In contrast, EXP 3174 is effective only when the RAS is activated. These results may help in the choice of inhibitors of the RAS in heart failure.",

Five hundred and four patients, with a mean age of 62 +/- 12 years, were included during the hospital period in the 74 participating intensive care units, 9 +/- 6 days after myocardial infarction (ejection fraction 34 +/- 6%). After a 6.25 mg test dose of Captopril, the dosage was progressively increased to the target dose of 150 mg at the end of the first month. Of the 504 patients included, 343 finished the trial and 161 stopped the trial prematurely. At the end of the hospital period, 73% received 75 mg/day: at the first follow-up visit (27 +/- 16 days after inclusion), 59% had attained 150 mg/day, this proportion increasing to 71% at the end of the trial (79 +/- 33 days after inclusion). There was no significant change in blood pressure for the whole study population. However, the systolic blood pressure of the patients receiving 150 mg/day of Captopril at the end of the trial was slightly higher than that observed at the end of the hospital period (126 +/- 17 mmHg and 116 +/- 17 mmHg respectively, p = 0.006).

Of the benign complications, hypotension was observed in 25% of patients, nearly half of which occurred during the hospital admission. The drugs prescribed in association with Captopril were Aspirin (78%), betablockers (57%), nitrate derivatives (42%) and diuretics (27%). Multivariate analysis showed 3 factors associated with good tolerance of the 150 mg dosage of Captopril: Killip Class I or II on admission, an ejection fraction > 30% and an initial systolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg. In conclusion, in this trial of dose titration, 3 out of 4 patients with myocardial infarction and left ventricular dysfunction, tolerated the 150 mg/day dosage of Captopril.

    "587": "Production of angiotensin II (Ang II) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR)-derived vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) has now been investigated. A nonpeptide antagonist (CV-11974) of Ang II type 1 receptors inhibited basal DNA synthesis in VSMC from SHR, but it had no effect on cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Ang II-like immunoreactivity, determined by radioimmunoassay after HPLC, was readily detected in conditioned medium and extracts of SHR-derived VSMC, whereas it was virtually undetectable in VSMC from WKY rats. Isoproterenol increased the amount of Ang II-like immunoreactivity in conditioned medium and extracts of SHR-derived VSMC, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor delapril significantly reduced the amount of Ang II-like immunoreactivity in conditioned medium and extracts of these cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the abundance of mRNAs encoding angiotensinogen, cathepsin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme was greater in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. The abundance of cathepsin D protein by Western blotting was greater in VSMC from SHR than in cells from WKY rats. Ang I-generating and acid protease activities were detected in VSMC from SHR, but not in cells from WKY rats. These results suggest that SHR-derived VSMC generate Ang II with increases in angiotensinogen, cathepsin D, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, which contribute to the basal growth. Production of Ang II by homogeneous cultures of VSMC is considered as a new mechanism of hypertensive vascular disease.",

The effects of long-term treatment with trandolapril, an angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitor, on exercise capacity of rats with chronic heart failure (CHF) following coronary artery ligation were examined. CHF was developed by 8 weeks after the coronary artery ligation. 2. The running time of rats with CHF in the treadmill test was shortened to approximately 65% of that of sham-operated rats (16.3+/-1.2 vs. 25.1+/-1.6 min, n = 7; P<0.05). ATP, creatine phosphate (CP), and lactate contents of the gracilis muscle of rats with CHF were similar to those of sham-operated rats before running. After running, ATP and CP were decreased and lactate was increased in both rats with CHF and sham-operated rats. There were no significant differences in the levels of energy metabolites between rats with CHF and sham-operated rats. The rates of decrease in ATP and CP and rate of increase in lactate in the gracilis muscle of rats with CHF during exercise were greater than those of sham operated rats (2.5, 2.0 and 1.5 fold high, respectively), suggesting wastage of energy during exercise in the animals with CHF. 3.

In this study we measured the rates of total, oxidative, and nonoxidative glucose disposal, glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, endogenous glucose production, and lipid oxidation using a 4-h euglycemic (approximately 5 mmol/L) hyperinsulinemic (approximately 300 pmol/L) clamp in combination with a dual glucose tracer infusion ([3-(3)H]- and [U-14C] D-glucose) and indirect calorimetry in 40 nonobese subjects with type 2 diabetes.

Antihypertensive treatment resulted in a significant increase in total glucose disposal during insulin clamp as well as in basal and insulin-stimulated nonoxidative glucose disposal rates. On the contrary, oxidative glucose disposal was significantly decreased by antihypertensive treatment, mainly in the basal state. The changes in glucose disposal rates were not significantly different in subjects treated with lacidipine and in those treated with lisinopril. The suppression of endogenous glucose production during insulin clamp was significantly greater after lacidipine than after lisinopril. These results suggest that treatment of subjects with type 2 diabetes with either lacidipine or lisinopril has no adverse effect on glucose metabolism. Conversely, both drugs seem to improve insulin sensitivity.",

Analysis of RNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed the presence of mRNA for angiotensin-converting enzyme in both types of cells. In addition, we found that squamous cells secreted the enzyme into the culture medium more than basal cells did. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (imidaprilat, enalaprilat) inhibited the enzyme activity in bronchial epithelial cells with an IC50 of 0.9-3.6 nM.

    "601": "Comprehensive evaluation of renal transplants has been important in differential diagnosis of medical and surgical complications in the early post-transplantation period and in the long-term follow-up. If performed well, it yields excellent functional and good anatomic information about the graft that can be effectively used in the patient. That includes selection of patients for biopsy and for various drug regimens. This is true especially in patients with anuric acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and in patients with developing chronic rejection. Improving indices of renal function (effective renal plasma flow, uptake of tubular tracers) can indicate resolution of tubular injury (ATN) while there is still no improvement in plasma creatinine. In patients with chronic rejection, plasma creatinine increases only after approximately 30% of renal function is lost due to graft fibrosis. Early recognition of this condition could permit treatment and delay of retransplantation. The protocol recommended at the Copenhagen meeting includes a flow study, scintigram of the kidneys, prevoid and postvoid bladder image, injection site image (quality control), time/activity curves of the graft and bladder, and quantitative data of perfusion, function, and tracer transit. The flow study obtained during the initial transit of the bolus through the graft could be performed either with 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine, or 99mTc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA). Quantitative analysis of perfusion facilitates interpretation of the study during the early post-transplantation period. ATN, common in cadaver transplants, typically shows adequate perfusion. The function phase should include images and time/activity curves. Images alone are insufficient. Quantitative data such as clearance or other indices of function and indices of tracer transit are essential for correct interpretation of the results. Normal images and normal graft function reliably exclude clinically important complications. A single scintigram demonstrating prolonged tracer transit with decreased function cannot separate acute rejection and ATN. On serial studies, decline in function and poor perfusion are indicative of acute rejection. A normally appearing scintigram without cortical retention, but with low function, is consistent with chronic rejection. Pharmacological intervention to exclude obstruction (diuretic renogram) or hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis (angiotensin converting enzyme challenge) should be used whenever indicated.",

Captopril and diuresis renography have made strides in establishing greater consensus of interpretation and procedure. Commonplace aspirin, the ubiquitous wonder drug, has revealed an unexpected role in renography by way of its inhibition of prostaglandin E2.

The use of the consensus process to help standardize procedures and recommend interpretative criteria provides guidance for the nuclear medicine practitioner, serves as a basis to improve the standard of practice, and facilitates pooling of data from different centers. This review draws on the consensus criteria to present a personal approach to radionuclide renography with a particular emphasis on diuresis renography and the detection of renovascular hypertension. Patients are encouraged to come well hydrated and void immediately prior to the study. Our standard radiopharmaceutical is 99mTc mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3). Routine quantitative indices include a MAG3 clearance, whole kidney and cortical (parenchymal) regions of interest, measurements of relative uptake, time to peak height (Tmax), 20 min/max count ratio, residual urine volume and a T(1/2) in patients undergoing diuresis renography. A 1-minute image of the injection site is obtained at the conclusion of the study to check for infiltration because infiltration can invalidate a plasma sample clearance and alter the renogram curve. A postvoid image of the kidneys and bladder is obtained to calculate residual urine volume and to better evaluate drainage from the collecting system. In patients undergoing diuresis renography, the T(1/2) is calculated using a region of interest around the activity in the dilated collecting system. A prolonged T(1/2), however, should never be the sole criterion for diagnosing the presence of obstruction; the T(1/2) must be interpreted in the context of the sequential images, total and individual kidney function, other quantitative indices and available diagnostic studies. The goal of ACE inhibitor renography is to detect renovascular hypertension, not renal artery stenosis. Patients with a positive study have a high probability of cure or amelioration of the hypertension following revascularization. In patients with azotemia or in patients with a small, poorly functioning kidney, the test result is often indeterminate (intermediate probability) with an abnormal baseline study that does not change following ACE inhibition. In patients with normal renal function, the test is highly accurate. To avoid unrealistic expectations on the part of the referring physician, it is often helpful to explain the likely differences in test results in these two-patient populations prior to the study.", 
    "604": "Diabetes is emerging as a new epidemic world-wide because of the ageing of the population but changes in lifestyle are also contributing. All means to prevent this development should be undertaken. In this context, treatment of hypertension is of importance due to the large number of people treated with antihypertensive drugs, many of which interfere with glucose metabolism. In three prospective cohort studies, treatment with beta-blockers and diuretics has been associated with an increased risk of development of diabetes. Prospective, randomized studies with antihypertensive drugs have demonstrated differences between different classes of drugs regarding effects on insulin sensitivity. Thus, treatment with beta-blockers or high-dose diuretics is associated with impairment in insulin sensitivity, whereas most modern calcium-channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are neutral. However, there are exceptions within the different classes. Captopril differs from the other ACE inhibitors and results in improvement of insulin sensitivity. The most pronounced improvements have been obtained with alpha1-blockers. In a recent study, the data indicate that also moxonidine, an imidazoline1 receptor agonist, is effective in lowering blood pressure and improving insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients. In populations at high risk for diabetes, it may be justified to select drugs that improve insulin sensitivity when treating hypertension in insulin-resistant individuals.", 
    "605": "Management strategies in hypertension evolve in response to an increased understanding of underlying pathophysiological processes and developments and refinements in drug treatments. Recent research has identified the regulatory role of the imidazoline (I1) receptor in sympathetic outflow and blood pressure regulation and this has led to the development of moxonidine, a highly selective centrally acting antihypertensive agent. At a practical level, moxonidine is suitable for single daily dosing in hypertension. Furthermore, in comparative studies moxonidine has a low incidence of symptomatic adverse effects comparable, for example, to that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, captopril and enalapril. The antihypertensive efficacy of moxonidine has now been established in a series of comparative clinical trials against all other first-line antihypertensive drug classes but, in line with current concepts, it may be necessary to look beyond blood pressure reduction. For example, centrally acting agents are known to be effective for promoting the regression of LV hypertrophy and studies in hypertensive patients have shown that antihypertensive treatment with moxonidine successfully leads to significant reductions in LV mass indices. Furthermore, there is now evidence that moxonidine has a beneficial effect on insulin sensitivity such that there are likely to be improvements in the overall metabolic profile. Thus, the clinical characteristics of moxonidine indicate that it is well suited for consideration among the first-line antihypertensive treatment choices.", 
    "606": "This study compared the antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of a combination tablet containing the vascular-selective calcium antagonist felodipine and the beta1-selective adrenergic antagonist metoprolol, with a combination tablet of captopril-hydrochlorothiazide in a randomized, double-blind trial involving 109 patients with mild to moderate hypertension. After 2 weeks on placebo, patients with a supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg were randomized to felodipine-metoprolol, 5/50 mg o.d. (Logimax) or captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 25/25 mg o.d. (Capozide). After a further 4 weeks, there was a mandatory dose increase to felodipine-metoprolol 10/100 mg o.d., and captopril-hydrochlorothiazide, 50/25 mg o.d., and treatment then continued for a another 4 weeks. At the end of the study, felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide. The mean differences in change in supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure between treatments after 8 weeks were 5.2 and 3.4 mm Hg, respectively, in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (p<0.05). Standing blood pressure also showed trends in favour of felodipine-metoprolol. The proportion of responders was similar in both groups. Both treatments were well tolerated. Two patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and 5 with captopril-hydrochlorothiazide discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Felodipine-metoprolol combination reduced supine blood pressure significantly more than captopril-hydrochlorothiazide with maintained tolerability.",

    "611": "The enzyme 11 beta HSD catalyzes the interconversion of the biologically active cortisol and the biologically inactive cortisone. There are two distinct isozymes: 11 beta HSD type 1 is mainly expressed in liver and is a bidirectional enzyme, with both dehydrogenase and reductase activity. 11 beta HSD type 2 is mainly expressed in kidney and is a unidirectional enzyme with only dehydrogenase activity. 11 beta HSD type 2 protects the mineralocorticoid receptor from being activated by cortisol. Thus, specificity of this receptor in vivo is enzyme and not receptor mediated. The syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess is caused by a congenital deficiency of 11 beta HSD type 2. Liquorice-induced hypertension is an example of an acquired defect in dehydrogenase activity of 11 beta HSD, caused by glycyrrhetinic acid. 11 beta HSD may play a role in the pathogenesis of 'essential' hypertension, obesity and type 1 diabetes mellitus. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors enhance dehydrogenase activity of 11 beta HSD, which may contribute to their natriuretic effect.", 
    "612": "The Captopril Prevention Project (CAPPP) was a prospective, randomized, open trial which aimed at comparing the prevention by captopril (n = 5492) or by a conventional treatment (n = 5493; diuretics or beta-blockers) of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg). After a mean follow-up of 6.1 years, the results regarding the primary endpoint and most secondary endpoints were not significantly different between the two therapeutic modalities. The only differences (perhaps due to a randomisation bias) were a slightly higher incidence of stroke, but a lower risk of diabetes mellitus, in the captopril group than in the group receiving conventional treatment. In conclusion, the CAPPP study demonstrates, for the first time, that captopril, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, is as effective as conventional treatment with diuretics or beta-blockers, two drugs whose efficacy has already been demonstrated when compared to placebo, in the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients.", 
    "613": "The goal of the present study was to determine whether terlipressin, an agonist of the vasopressin system, could counteract perioperative hypotension refractory to common vasopressor therapy and to analyze its circulatory effects. We enrolled 51 consecutive vascular surgical patients chronically treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or antagonists of the receptor of angiotensin II, who received a standardized opioid-propofol anesthetic. Of these 51 patients, 32 had at least one episode of hypotension, which responded to epinephrine or phenylephrine. In 10 other patients, systolic arterial pressure (SAP) did not remain above 100 mm Hg for 1 min, despite three bolus doses of ephedrine or phenylephrine. In these patients, we injected a bolus of 1 mg of terlipressin, repeated twice if necessary. Hemodynamic and echocardiographic variables were recorded every 30 s over 6 min. In eight patients, arterial pressure was restored with one injection of terlipressin; in two other patients, three injections were necessary. One minute after the last injection of terlipressin, the SAP increased from 88+/-3 to 100+/-4 mm Hg and reached 117+/-5 mm Hg (P = 0.001) 3 min after the injection and remained stable around this value. This increase in SAP was associated with significant changes in left ventricular end-diastolic area (17.9+/-2 vs 20.2+/-2.2 cm2; P = 0.003), end-systolic area (8.1+/-1.3 vs 9.6+/-1.5 cm2; P = 0.004), end-systolic wall stress (45+/-8 vs 66+/-12; P = 0.001), and heart rate (60+/-4 vs 55+/-3 bpm; P = 0.001). Fractional area change and velocity of fiber shortening did not change significantly. No additional injection of vasopressor was required during the perioperative period. No change in ST segment was observed after the injection.",

    "615": "Diuretic therapy decreases capillary wedge pressure and improves New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class both in acute and chronic heart failure. In advanced symptomatic heart failure, loop diuretics are generally necessary to improve symptoms of congestion. Diuretic resistance in the edematous patient has been defined as a clinical state in which diuretic response is diminished or lost before the therapeutic goal of relief from edema has been reached. The major causes of diuretic resistance are functional renal failure (prerenal azotemia), hyponatremia, altered diuretic pharmacokinetics, and sodium retention caused by counterregulatory mechanisms intended to reestablish the effective arterial blood volume. Therapeutic approaches to combat diuretic resistance include restriction of fluid and sodium intake, use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, changes in route (oral, intravenous) and timing (single dose, multiple doses, continuous infusion) of diuretic therapy, and use of diuretic combinations.", 
    "616": "Angiotensin II (AII), produced systemically as well as locally in the heart, affects the coronary circulation, as do consequences of its pharmacologic inhibition. AII is a powerful vasoconstrictor directly acting on vascular smooth muscle cells, modulating sympathetic innervation and calcium ion influx, and releasing other vasoconstrictor factors. In addition to these immediate actions, AII has longer-term biologic actions that influence cardiac endothelial function, vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype expression, and fibroblast proliferation. Moreover, the production of AII is interrelated with the vasodilator substances bradykinin, nitric oxide, and prostaglandins E2 and I2 (prostacyclin). Circulating hormonal actions of AII include fluid retention, direct vasoconstriction, and sympathetic neuromodulation, all resulting in increased left ventricular preload and afterload. Because of these local and hormonal characteristics, AII can immediately affect the myocardial balance of metabolic demand and supply and long term can induce structural vascular and myocardial alterations. Pharmacologic inhibition of AII production likely conveys myocardial and vascular protection in situations of acute myocardial oxygen debt. In the long term, inhibition of AII may attenuate structural changes in the coronary microcirculation related to various cardiomyopathies or acute tissue injury, and direct antiatherogenic effects may also occur.", 
    "617": "The present investigation was undertaken to study the effects of chronic oral ramipril (1 mg/kg) treatment in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. Single tail vein injection of STZ (45 mg/kg, i.v.) produced a diabetic state exhibiting all the cardinal symptoms such as loss of body weight, polydipsia, polyuria, glucosuria, polyphagia, hypoinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia. The diabetic state was also found to be associated with bradycardia, hypothyroidism, cardiac depression and cardiomyopathy. Ramipril treatment prevented STZ-induced hypertension, bradycardia, hypothyroidism, hyperchosesterolaemia and partially the cardiomayopathy. Ramipril treatment could not, however prevent STZ-induced loss of body weight, polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, hyperglycaemia, hypoinsulinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and cardiac depression. Our data suggests that ramipril has a few beneficial effects in the STZ-treated diabetic rats.", 
    "618": "Urinary excretion rates of angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), and angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] were determined in normotensive Sprague Dawley (SD), spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), and mRen-2 transgenic hypertensive animals before and following blockade of Ang II synthesis or activity for two weeks. This study was performed to determine for the first time whether inhibition of Ang II alters the excretion of angiotensin peptides in the urine. Rats were given either tap water or water medicated with lisinopril, losartan or both agents in combination. Blood pressure was monitored at regular intervals during the experiment by the tail-cuff method, and once again at the end of the study with a catheter implant into a carotid artery. Metabolic studies and 24 h urinary excretion variables and angiotensin peptides were determined before and during the procedures. While all three treatments normalized the blood pressure of hypertensive animals, therapy with either lisinopril or the combination of lisinopril and losartan had a greater antihypertensive effect in both SHR and [mRen-2]27 transgenic hypertensive rats. In the urine, the concentration of the angiotensins (normalized by 24-h creatinine excretion) was several-fold higher in the untreated hypertensive animals than in normotensive SD rats. In SD rats, lisinopril or lisinopril and losartan produced a sustained rise in urinary levels of Ang-(1-7) without changes in the excretion of Ang I and Ang II. In contrast, Ang I and Ang-(1-7) were significantly elevated in SHR medicated with lisinopril alone or in combination with losartan. Only losartan, however, augmented urinary levels of Ang II in the SHR. The antihypertensive effects of the three separate regimens had no effect on the urinary excretion of angiotensin peptides in [mRen-2]27 transgenic hypertensive rats. These data show that Ang I and Ang-(1-7) are excreted in large amounts in the urine of SD, SHR and [mRen-2]27 hypertensive rats. The unchanged Ang-(1-7) excretion in transgenic hypertensive (Tg+) rats after inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system agrees with the previous finding of a reduced plasma clearance of the peptide in this model of hypertension. The data suggest that this form of hypertension may be associated with increased activity of an endogenous converting enzyme inhibitor.", 
    "619": "Greenland Inuit are a population with a low risk of cardiovascular disease. Recently, we stated that frequencies of potentially high risk alleles of the apolipoproteins, fibrinogen, factor V, glycoprotein IIIa and factor VII (FVII) genes have different allele frequencies in the Inuit when compared with Caucasian populations. We have extended this study and evaluated whether or not this was also true for the genetic polymorphisms of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensinogen in a group of 133 Greenland Inuit, aged 30-34 gamma. In addition, we compared the plasma levels of these factors and those of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimer in Inuit and in Danes, comparable for age and gender. Frequencies (f) were assessed of the alleles that are known as the potential high risk alleles in Caucasians. In the Inuit, the f(insertion allele) of the t-PA intron8ins311 polymorphism was 0.37 (CI 0.32-0.43), the f(4G allele) of the PAI-1 promoter polymorphism was 0.88 (CI 0.83-0.91), the f(deletion allele) of the ACE intron16ins287 polymorphism was 0.40 (CI 0.33-0.47) and the f(M-allele) of the angiotensinogen M/T353 polymorphism was 0.30(CI 0.25-0.38). As for fibrinogen and FVII polymorphisms, these frequencies are all significantly different from what is reported for Caucasian populations. In the Inuit, plasma levels of fibrinogen and D-Dimer were higher than in the Danes, the PAI-1 levels were lower and FVII, t-PA and CRP levels were comparable. The observed allele frequencies of the polymorphisms of t-PA, fibrinogen, FVII, ACE, angiotensinogen and the plasma levels of PAI-1 and D-Dimer were in accordance with the low CVD risk in the Inuit, considering the observed associations between these measures and CVD risk in Caucasian populations, but for other measures this was not the case (allele frequencies of the PAI-1 polymorphism, and plasma levels of fibrinogen, FVII and t-PA). In conclusion there are clear differences in genetic background and plasma levels of risk factors in Greenland Inuit compared with Caucasian populations, and these differences were sometimes, but not always, in accordance with the observed low cardiovascular disease risk of the Inuit population.",

The main outcome was the number of heart failure hospitalizations over 12 months. Twelve hundred patients were identified. Mean age was 64 +/- 16 years, 94% were black, 57% were women, and 40% were > or = 65 years old. Ninety-eight percent had a history of systemic hypertension and 55% had uncontrolled hypertension. Other comorbidities were left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (64%), coronary artery disease (52%), and tobacco abuse (28%). Sixty-five percent of patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, 51% on calcium antagonists, and 8% on beta blockers. Most patients had suboptimal dosing of ACE inhibitors and there was inappropriate use of calcium antagonists in 56% of patients with moderate or severe systolic dysfunction. Diabetes mellitus and echocardiographic wall motion abnormality were independently associated with frequent admissions for women but not for men. Medication-related increase in heart failure hospitalization was seen for calcium antagonists in patients with severe LV dysfunction (odds ratio 2.24, 95% confidence intervals 1.0 to 5.03; p <0.03). Uncontrolled hypertension, underdosing of ACE inhibitors, and overuse of calcium antagonists in patients with significant LV dysfunction are potential targets for intervention.",

    "623": "BACKGROUND: The ratio between the magnitude of blood pressure reduction during the steady-state dosage interval (trough) and the maximum blood pressure reduction (peak) is an integrated in-vivo index both of the pharmacokinetic properties and of pharmacodynamic activity of an antihypertensive drug. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are often characterized by a low (often lower than 50%) trough: peak ratio but no direct drug comparisons are available. OBJECTIVE: To compare the absolute blood pressure reduction and the trough: peak ratio of daily doses of two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 5 mg ramipril and 10 mg enalapril. METHOD: After a 1-month wash-out and a 2-week placebo run-in, 25 mild hypertensives aged 47 +/- 4 years (17 men and eight women) were randomly assigned to treatments separated by a 2-week interval. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was performed and trough: peak ratio was calculated by the fast Fourier transform analysis of placebo-effect-subtracted data. RESULTS: After 1 month of ramipril treatment, 24 h blood pressure decreased from 139 +/- 10 to 129 +/- 11 mmHg for systolic (P < 0.05) and from 89 +/- 8 to 81 +/- 5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01). Also enalapril treatment caused a significant 24 h reduction in blood pressure both for systolic (to 132 +/- 7 mmHg, P < 0.05) and for diastolic blood pressure (to 84 +/- 5 mmHg, P < 0.05). Placebo caused a 24 h reduction in blood pressure (to 136 +/- 8 mmHg for systolic and 87 +/- 5 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure, NS, versus wash-out period). The two drugs were equally effective in reducing ambulatory blood pressure, but ramipril produced a trough: peak ratio significantly higher than that with enalapril both for systolic (48 +/- 11%, range 34-74%, versus 38 +/- 11%, range 21-67%, P < 0.005)and for diastolic blood pressure (47 +/- 11%, range 30-79 %, versus 37 +/- 12%, range 21-68%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The low trough : peak ratios could have been due to the daily pattern of blood pressure of mild hypertensives, many of whom are normotensives at night-time, so that the main antihypertensive effect is exerted during daytime rather than during the night or early morning.", 
    "624": "To determine whether the cardiovascular effects of chronic treatment with lisinopril are age related, we compared baroreflex sensitivity and pressor responsiveness in 4-mo- and 21-mo-old male rats that had been given oral lisinopril daily for 4 wk. Reflex bradycardia elicited by elevating blood pressure with phenylephrine was stronger in 4-mo-old rats than it was in 21-mo-old rats and also stronger in lisinopril-treated rats than it was in untreated rats of the same age. Pressor responses to angiotensin or norepinephrine were recorded after combined cholinergic and beta-adrenergic blockade and then analyzed not only as absolute but also as percent increases in mean pressure. Although pressor responses seemed to be slightly reduced by lisinopril when expressed as absolute increases in mean pressure, corresponding percent increases were always larger in 4-mo-old rats than they were in 21-mo-old rats and were clearly enhanced by lisinopril more in younger rats. The stronger overall enhancement of pressor responsiveness and reflex bradycardia in younger rats suggests that the cardiovascular effects of lisinopril diminish with advancing age.",

We report three patients with diabetic nephropathy presented with the nephrotic syndrome who showed a marked decrease in proteinuria following the administration of camostat mesilate, a protease inhibitor. Each patient was resistant to treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a platelet-aggregation inhibitor. Camostat mesilate, 600 mg/day, orally, caused a marked decrease in urinary protein excretion after the 7th consecutive day of drug administration. There were no serious adverse effects. Its mechanism of action in this respect is not known. Camostat mesilate thus merits clinical trials in the treatment of nephrotic syndrome related to diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "626": "The Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy Core and Follow-Up Study found that > or =36 mo of continued ramipril therapy decreased substantially the risk of end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in patients with chronic nephropathies and a urinary protein excretion rate > or =3 g/24 h. This study investigates the time-dependent changes in GFR in these patients and in control subjects who were randomized to conventional therapy during the Core period and switched to ramipril during the Follow-Up study. Analyses included 150 patients (continued ramipril: n = 74; switched to ramipril: n = 76) who had at least three GFR measurements (including baseline) during the whole observation period and a subgroup of 43 patients (continued ramipril: n = 26; switched to ramipril: n = 17) who had at least six GFR measurements, including at least three on the Core and at least three on the Follow-Up study. Ramipril (1.25 to 5 mg/d) and conventional therapy were targeted at achieving a diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg. The main efficacy variables were GFR and ESRF (need for dialysis). Analysis was by intention to treat. Throughout the study, the mean +/- SEM rate of GFR decline (deltaGFR) was significantly lower in patients continued on ramipril compared to those switched to ramipril (0.51+/-0.09 versus 0.76+/-0.10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per mo, P<0.03). In patients on continued ramipril who had at least six GFR measured--but not in control subjects--deltaGFR progressively improved with time and, in the cohort with the longest follow-up, decreased from (in ml/min per 1.73 m2 per mo): 0.16+/-0.12 (at 18 mo) to 0.10+/-0.05 (at 60 mo). This rate was about 10-fold slower compared to patients on conventional therapy during the REIN Core study. Analyses of the individual slopes found that at the end of the follow-up, 10 of 26 patients on continued ramipril therapy had a positive deltaGFR and another 10 patients had an improvement of deltaGFR while on ramipril therapy. DeltaGFR significantly improved in parallel with a significant reduction in proteinuria. Changes in deltaGFR (P = 0.0001) and proteinuria (P = 0.04) were significantly different in the two groups. Baseline characteristics and changes in systolic and diastolic BP and 24-h urine urea and sodium excretion were comparable. The present results offer evidence that in chronic nephropathies, the tendency of GFR to decline with time can be effectively halted, even in patients with remarkably severe disease.", 
    "627": "The objective of the present study was to determine the predictive factors of treatment compliance in hypertensive patients. This was an open large-scale multicenter study where mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients received trandolapril (2 mg) once daily for 30 to 60 days in addition to their usual treatment. Trandolapril was packed in electronic pill boxes that registered date and time of each opening. The main compliance parameters were the percentage of missed doses, the percentage of delayed doses, and the percentage of correct dosing periods. Predictive factors of poor compliance (correct dosing periods < 80%) were determined using a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Two thousand one hundred seventy-three patients aged 60 +/- 12 years were analyzed. Of the total patients 37% were poor compliers; 29% of patients forgot more than 10% of doses and 36% of patients delayed more than 10% of doses. Ranked predictive factors of poor compliance were: age < 60 years (odds ratio [OR], 1.80 [1.49 to 2.17], P = .0001), the Paris area (OR, 1.70 [1.32 to 2.19], P = .0001), smokers (OR, 1.65 [1.29 to 2.11], P = .0001), monotherapy (OR, 1.40 [1.14 to 1.72], P = .0012), and baseline diastolic blood pressure > or = 100 mm Hg (OR, 1.21 [1.01 to 1.46], P = .044). Therefore, we conclude that young hypertensives, large city dwellers, and smokers are more likely to be poor compliers. The presence of some of these characteristics might incite the physician either to encourage patient compliance or to prescribe antihypertensive drugs that have an effect that persists even beyond 24 h.",

Joint National Committee (JNC) guidelines attempt to simplify this decision by recommending specific agents based on special considerations such as comorbidities. The objective of this study was to survey primary care physicians' antihypertensive prescribing practices and their treatment recommendations for patients with comorbidities. A direct mail survey was sent to a national random sample of 500 office-based primary care internists, family practitioners, and general practitioners. There were no significant differences between initial treatment recommendations at the time of the survey and those recommended before the survey. However, there were several therapeutic classes whose reported utilization for specific comorbidities significantly changed over 18 months. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reportedly increased in patients with congestive heart failure and diabetes. In addition, the reported use of selective beta-blockers increased for patients with a history of myocardial infarction. Physicians did not follow JNC recommendations when initiating treatment in black patients, older patients, or those with mild renal failure. Younger physicians were more likely than older physicians to select agents consistent with guideline recommendations. Physicians did not adhere to JNC guidelines when initiating treatment in patients with comorbidities; however, more physicians are prescribing recommended agents today as compared to 18 months ago. Younger physicians were more likely to prescribe agents consistent with the guidelines. More direct efforts are needed to ensure awareness and compliance with these guidelines.",

A chemically modified carbon paste was constructed with L-AAOD. The proposed amperometric biosensor proved reliable for the purity of I, II, and III. The linear working ranges obtained for drug assay were 0.001-100 mumol/l (I), 0.02-10 mumol/l (II), 0.08-50 mumol/l (III) over the pH ranges 7.0-7.4 (I), 6.8-7.4 (II), and 7.0-7.4 (III). The low limits of detection obtained were 5 pmol/l (I), 15 mumol/l (II), and 5 mumol/l (III), respectively. The selectivity of the biosensors was checked by both mixed and separate solution methods. Polyvinylpyrolidone and D-proline did not interfere with the assay of the studied drugs, whereas L-proline presented a potent interfering species. The relative standard deviation values (< 0.2%) make the biosensors suitable for direct amperometric assay of these angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

The enzyme activities significantly varied depending on the immunological phenotype and stage of cell differentiation, but no correlation was found between activities of ACE, DPP-IV, and aminopeptidases in the cells of different type. The cell lysates studied contained at least two classes of aminopeptidases: metal- and sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes. A sulfhydryl-dependent aminopeptidase with activity optimum at pH 8. 5-9.0 was found for the first time and is suggested to be from a poorly studied aminopeptidase family.

Recently, we documented that angiotensinogen (Agt -/-) or angiotensin type 1 receptor nullizygotes (Agtr1 -/-) do not develop renal pelvis nor ureteral peristaltic movement, both of which are essential for isolating the kidney from the high downstream ureteral pressure. We therefore examined whether these renal anomalies could be characterized as \"obstructive\" nephropathy.",

To assess the function of the urinary tract, baseline pelvic and ureteral pressures were measured.", 
    "633": "The structural anomalies were qualitatively indistinguishable between the Agtr1 -/- without surgical obstruction versus the wild type with complete UUO. Thus, in both kidneys, the calyx was enlarged, whereas the papilla was atrophic; tubulointerstitial cells underwent proliferation and also apoptosis. Both were also characterized by interstitial macrophage infiltration and fibrosis, and within the local lesion, transforming growth factor-beta 1, platelet-derived growth factor-A and insulin-like growth factor-1 were up-regulated, whereas epidermal growth factor was down-regulated. Moreover, quantitative differences that exist between mutant kidneys without surgical obstruction and wild-type kidneys with surgical UUO were abolished when both underwent the same complete surgical UUO. The hydraulic baseline pressure was always lower in the pelvis than that in the ureter in the wild type, whereas this pressure gradient was reversed in the mutant.",

On the other hand, we found that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) suppressed the proliferative response of the rat anterior pituitary gland to oestrogens. To answer the question whether the angiotensin system is involved in the control of the cell proliferation of the uterine epithelium, the effects of an ACE inhibitor, enalapril maleate, and of angiotensins II and IV, alone or together with losartan, an antagonist of angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1), on endometrial epithelial cell proliferation have been studied. The experiments were performed on ovariectomized female Wistar rats. In the first experiment the animals were injected with a single dose of oestradiol benzoate or received an injection of solvent only. Half of the oestrogen-treated rats were injected additionally with enalapril maleate (EN, twice daily). The incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrDU) into endometrial cell nuclei was used as an index of cell proliferation. It was found that oestradiol alone dramatically increased the BrDU labelling index (LI) of endometrial cell nuclei, and this effect was partially blocked by the simultaneous treatment with EN. In the second experiment, the animals were injected intraperitoneally with angiotensin II (AII), angiotensin IV (AIV) or saline, alone or together with losartan. It was found that AIV induced an increase in the LI in uterine epithelium, and this effect was not blocked by the simultaneous treatment with losartan. The increase in LI in uterine epithelium was also observed in the rats treated with AII and with losartan. These findings suggest an involvement of angiotensin IV in the control of uterine epithelium cell proliferation.", 
    "644": "Heart failure, still nowadays an important cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries, is a complex of symptoms related to inadequate peripheric perfusion and often to the retention of fluid, that results from an impaired left ventricular pump function. Treatment of heart failure has seen considerable changes in the last years. Short term goals of therapy are directed towards the relieve of symptoms that can be commonly managed by the use of vasodilators, diuretics, digoxin, in order to obtain an improvement in myocardial functional capacity and quality of life of patients. Nevertheless, it is important to recognize that improvement of symptoms is not necessarily correlated with correction of left ventricular dysfunction and, most important, with improvement of survival. In late 1980s both experimental and clinical observations carried out in an attempt to explain the progression of the disease and its poor long-term survival, led the physicians to think about heart failure as a neurohormonal disorder. This new conceptual model has first led to the widespread introduction of angiotensin converting inhibitors in clinical practice; then, the evidence that sympathetic activation might play an important role in the progression of heart failure, led the investigators to propose that beta-blocking agents might be useful in the management of heart failure. Accumulating clinical evidence indicates that beta blocker therapy, particularly with third generation beta-blocking agents, not only improves left ventricular function but also may reduce and reverse pathological remodeling in the heart. Ongoing large scale clinical trials may confirm the mounting evidence, from numerous clinical studies, that these agents may prolong survival in patients with heart failure.", 
    "645": "We determined whether neutrophil recruitment induced by the T-lymphocyte cytokine, interleukin-17 (IL-17) is modulated by tachykinins in airways in vivo. Cell recruitment into airways was induced by either human (h) IL-17 (1 microgram) or rat (r) IL-1beta (2. 5 ng), instilled intratracheally in rats (n = 5 to 7). Six hours after instillation, hIL-17 (3.1 +/- 1.2 x 10(6) cells/ml) and rIL-1beta (4.1 +/- 0.5 x 10(6) cells/ml), respectively, induced a significant and selective increase in neutrophil count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) when compared with vehicle (0.6 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) cells/ml). For hIL-17, this effect was dose-dependent. Inhalation of peptidase inhibitors (phosphoramidon plus captopril) potentiated the effect of both hIL-17 and rIL-1beta. Inhalation of a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (phosphoramidon) alone also increased the neutrophil count for hIL-17, whereas an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril) alone did not. A selective neurokinin (NK)-1 receptor antagonist (SR 140333) reduced the neutrophil count, both with and without phosphoramidon pretreatment. In conclusion, IL-17 selectively recruits neutrophils into rat airways in vivo and this effect is modulated by endogenous tachykinins acting via NK-1 receptors.",

    "648": "It is unclear whether losartan, an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, protects the heart against acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. Therefore we evaluated cardiac protection conferred by pre- and postischemic treatment as well as by exclusive postischemic treatment with losartan. Furthermore, we sought to determine both the extent of this protection and its dependence on bradykinin in comparison with quinaprilat, a cardioprotective angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Cardiac protection was assessed as recovery of coronary flow, left ventricular developed pressure, phosphocreatine, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in isolated perfused rat hearts after 15 min of global ischemia and 30 min of postischemic reperfusion. We found that, in hearts pre- and postischemically treated with losartan (1 microM) or quinaprilat (0.1 microM), these variables all recovered significantly better than those in untreated control hearts. In hearts that were only postischemically treated with losartan, these variables also recovered significantly better than those in control hearts. In contrast, in hearts treated with the combination of the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 with quinaprilat or losartan, the recovery of the variables no longer differed from that in control hearts. In conclusion, losartan protects the heart against acute ischemia-reperfusion injury. This protection can be achieved by pre- and postischemic treatment as well as by exclusive postischemic treatment with losartan. Furthermore, the extent of this protection is equivalent to that conferred by quinaprilat and, unexpectedly, dependent on bradykinin.", 
    "649": "The antihypertensive effect of long-term treatment (6 months) with placebo (as control), verapamil, trandolapril, and their combination (verapamil plus trandolapril) was investigated in Wistar rats rendered hypertensive by extensive renal mass ablation, as a model lacking genetic hypertensive determinants. Arterial pressure was monitored during treatment and at the end, aortic structure and functionality were investigated. Trandolapril and the combination prevented the increase in pressure observed in the control group after renal handicap, whereas verapamil was much less effective. Trandolapril and the combination were similarly effective, whereas verapamil was ineffective, or even deleterious, at reducing aortic lamina media hypertrophy, the wall-to-lumen ratio, lamina media cross-sectional area, potassium chloride-induced contraction, and at increasing acetylcholine relaxation. The response to noradrenaline decreased in the trandolapril group, increased in the verapamil group, and remained unmodified in the association group. In conclusion, treatment with trandolapril exerts beneficial antihypertensive actions in this model of induced hypertension, showing continuous control of blood pressure and prevention of structural and functional alteration of the aorta. Verapamil exerts weak control of arterial pressure and produces, if any, deleterious effects on the structure and function of the aorta. These negative effects of verapamil are overcome by coadministration of trandolapril.",

A total of 345 heart failure patients in New York Heart Association functional classes 2 and 3 without atrial fibrillation, dyspnea of bronchopulmonary origin, or hypertension not controlled with diuretics was randomized for digoxin (n = 175) or captopril (n = 170) treatment and followed up for a median of 4.5 years. Socioeconomic, demographic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, spirometric, and chest radiograph data were obtained at the initial examination. In a random sample of half the patients, ergometric, echocardiographic, and Holter records were obtained at entry and at 3 and 18 months. Patients were followed up for > or = 3 years. The end points were mortality, hospitalization for cardiac events, deterioration in quality of life, worsening of functional class, and need for digoxin or captopril in the captopril and digoxin groups, respectively. The trial had to be terminated prematurely owing to the difficulty in finding candidates free of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor treatment. Baseline patient characteristics were similar in both groups. From the clinical point of view, only the 48-month mortality was relevantly lower (20.9 vs. 31.9%, respectively) among patients treated with captopril than that in those receiving digoxin (log rank test, p = 0.07). No statistically or clinically relevant differences were found in other end points or adverse effects. The results suggest but do not confirm the hypothesis that captopril treatment in mild to moderate heart failure might provide better long-term survival than digoxin.", 
    "651": "Much attention has been focused in recent years on ways of optimizing the use and cost-effectiveness of erythropoietin therapy. The balance of evidence suggests that the subcutaneous route allows lower doses to be used compared with the intravenous route, and dosing should be two to three times weekly. Concomitant use of intravenous iron potently enhances the response to erythropoietin, and more recently other adjuvant therapies such as ascorbic acid, L-carnitine, folic acid, vitamin D, androgens, and other cytokines and growth factors have been investigated. Many factors can affect the response to erythropoietin, and underdialysis and co-administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have attracted much recent interest.

Of 21 patients receiving 497 plasma fractionation procedures, only the 2 patients who were receiving ACE inhibitors developed anaphylactoid reactions. Of 28 patients who had 680 cryofiltration procedures, only 2 of 5 patients who were taking ACE inhibitors developed anaphylactoid reactions. All patients developed facial flushing, increased warmth, bradycardia, and hypotension after approximately 1/2 to 1 L of plasma was processed during the procedures. Only a few procedures caused severe hypotension requiring discontinuation of the procedure. We quantified vasodilatory mediators in 1 patient, who developed pronounced symptoms. Results were obtained for 6-keto PGF1alpha, PGD-M, and methyl histamine in plasma. In addition, in the same patient, 2,3 dinor 6-keto PGF1alpha and methyl histamine were quantified in urine samples. Our results showed that plasma and urinary metabolites were not grossly elevated although they did increase slightly. Mild to moderate anaphylactoid reactions were observed in some patients on ACE inhibitors receiving plasma fractionation or cryofiltration apheresis. This was resolved by discontinuing either the ACE inhibitor, plasma fractionation, or cryofiltration apheresis.", 
    "653": "The dextran-sulfate cellulose (DSC) column used for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis adsorbs plasma constituents other than LDL that have the following characteristics: proteins containing apolipoprotein B, proteins involved in the initial contact phase of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (coagulation factor XII, high molecular weight kininogen and prekallikrein), factors with lipophilic characteristics (coagulation factor VII, VIII, and vitamin E), and proteins with adhesive or other characters (von Willebrand factor, fibronectin, and serum amyloid P components). Adsorption of these proteins seems to serve in the prevention or regression of atherosclerosis. Moreover, plasma treatment by the DSC column may be useful for treatment of such inexorable diseases as amyloidosis. On the other hand, the column generates bradykinin by activation of the initial contact phase of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Bradykinin generation may explain hypotension during LDL apheresis observed in patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.", 
    "654": "The authors have previously reported that oscillatory potentials (O.P.) of the electroretinogram are impaired in essential hypertensive patients before the appearance of funduscopic changes. They can therefore be considered an early marker of the nervous damage induced by hypertension. Aim of this study was to evaluate whether an antihypertensive regimen could influence the progression of this damage. O.P. were recorded in 35 essential hypertensives before antihypertensive treatment and after one-year treatment. The patients were randomly allocated into 4 treatment groups: 1) beta-blockers 2) ACE-Inhibitors 3) calcium antagonists 4) no pharmacological treatment. At the end of the study, blood pressure was significantly decreased in all but group 4. O.P., similar in the 4 groups at the beginning, were significantly higher at the end of the study only in patients treated with ACE-inhibitors. The results of this study suggest that although all hypotensive agents reduced blood pressure only ACE-I showed a protective effect on the retinal electric electrophysiology in hypertensive patients.", 
    "655": "Delayed captopril, started after the healing phase of myocardial infarction, improves perfusion by reducing tissue weight without affecting the vascular capacity of the heart. Early captopril, during the healing phase, prevents reactive hypertrophy, but the effects on angiogenesis are unknown. Therefore, the effects of early captopril (2 g/l drinking water, from 1 day until 3 weeks after myocardial infarction) on regional coronary flow related to tissue mass, were studied in isolated perfused hearts from rats, subjected to coronary artery ligation. Regional maximal vascular capacity was measured during nitroprusside-induced vasodilation, using radioactive microspheres. Maximal vascular capacity was not changed by captopril. Reactive hypertrophy in infarcted hearts only reached statistical significance in the left ventricular free wall. Since captopril prevented hypertrophy but did not affect regional capacity, peak tissue perfusion was improved. Indicating effects on metabolism, captopril restored the increased lactate/purine ratio in infarcted hearts. Thus, early captopril treatment prevented post-myocardial infarction hypertrophy but did not suppress angiogenesis, thus beneficially influencing the vascularization/tissue mass ratio, probably reflected by preservation of aerobic metabolism.",

Mean blood pressures in the normal-diet group, high-cholesterol-diet group, and high-cholesterol-diet group treated with a low dose of alacepril were very similar, while that in the high-cholesterol-diet group treated with a high dose of alacepril was significantly reduced. The level of low-density lipoprotein in the high-cholesterol-diet group was significantly higher than that in the normal-diet group, and the levels in the alacepril groups were significantly lower than those in the high-cholesterol-diet group. Atherosclerotic lesions in the normal- and high-cholesterol-diet groups were 13.2 +/- 0.34% and 64.1 +/- 10.48%, respectively, and those in the groups treated with low and high doses of alacepril were 32.3 +/- 13.2% and 16.0 +/- 1.57%, respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in the thoracic aorta in the high-cholesterol-diet group was significantly higher than that in the normal-diet group, and the ACE activities in the alacepril groups were lower than that in the high-cholesterol-diet group.

Administration of aldosterone with excess salt produces both cardiac hypertrophy and interstitial cardiac fibrosis in rats, and concomitant administration of potassium canrenoate at a dose that only modestly lowers blood pressure completely blocks the cardiac effects of aldosterone. In the present study, we examined the effect on left ventricular hypertrophy of adding a low dose of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist spironolactone (25 mg/d) to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril maleate) in patients with essential hypertension. Eighteen untreated patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension based on the WHO/ISH guidelines participated in this study.

Clinical problems related to elderly patients and multifaceted aspects of multidisciplinary approaches of medical care to these particular patients are also discussed with special emphasis on the aspect of improved quality of life associated with reduced mortality. Concepts of CHF have greatly changed over the past decades with regard to its pathophysiology, natural progression, mechanisms, causes of death, arrhythmias and treatment goals. Although the current most frequent aetiologies of CHF include coronary heart disease and dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertension has been revisited in a different way, and has been considered of pivotal importance in most recent trends and possibly in future perspectives. Nowadays, however, with the results of improved survival, alleviation of symptoms, improvement in functional capacity and prevention of associated complications including even left ventricular remodelling through various appropriate pharmacotherapies, patients with CHF are used to being physically and psychosocially more active than ever before. Thus, improvement of patients' quality of life and reduction of mortality have become of prime importance in achieving treatment goals. Another emerging aspect of CHF is aging itself, and special features in the medical care of elderly patients with CHF always have to be taken into consideration in reduction of hospital readmission along with improvement of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in the treatment of CHF, it remains a common disease with a poor prognosis. Therefore, this review focuses on what we should be trying to achieve in reaching goals to reduce repeated hospital readmission and mortality, and increase social activity and quality of life, especially in elderly patients with CHF. In these clinical settings, educational strategies for patients and their family members should be emphasised. Multidisciplinary interventions by nurses and possibly other contributions from a widely available social support system might be effective in preventing repeated hospital readmissions of elderly patients with CHF. In this regard, special precautions have to be paid in the management of elderly patients to achieve effective treatment goals, and any treatment strategy has to be appropriately determined through a comprehensive assessment of patient clinical profiles. Multidisciplinary approaches to these problems have to be effectively utilised to improve patients' quality of life, while possibly reducing medical expenses.",

The baroreflex curve, which reflects changes in muscle sympathetic-nerve activity caused by manipulations of blood pressure with sodium nitroprusside and phenylephrine, was shifted to the right in the patients, but baroreflex sensitivity was similar to that in the control subjects (-2.1+/-1.9 and -2.7+/-1.3 bursts per minute per mm Hg, respectively; P=0.36). A single dose of the sympatholytic drug clonidine caused a greater fall in blood pressure in the patients than in the control subjects. Treatment with enalapril normalized blood pressure and muscle sympathetic-nerve activity (at 23+/-10 bursts per minute) in the patients and shifted the baroreflex curve to the left, reflecting normal blood-pressure levels, without significantly changing sensitivity (-2.3+/-1.8 bursts per minute per mm Hg, P=0.96).

Ambulatory 24-h blood pressure measurements (ABPM) and echocardiography were performed at baseline and after 12 weeks' treatment. Complete data from 43 patients were analyzed. Mibefradil (n = 22; titration, 13 patients) reduced mean 24-h ABP from 159+/-14/102+/-7 mm Hg to 140+/-10/89+/-7 mm Hg after 12 weeks.

In the first series of experiments, rats were administered bosentan (100 mg/kg/day) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (10 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks beginning 24 h after RMR. As expected, cilazapril completely prevented the development of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal structural damage. In contrast, bosentan had no influence on the development of proteinuria and renal structural damage, although it had a moderate antihypertensive effect and improved creatinine clearance. A second set of experiments was performed to assess whether Ro 48-5695, a very potent ET antagonist optimized from bosentan, could prevent the development of renal damage and reverse established renal damage. Rats received Ro 48-5695 (30 mg/kg/day) beginning either 24 h (prevention) before for 8 weeks, or 4 weeks (reversal) after RMR. Ro 48-5695 attenuated the hypertension and the decline of creatinine clearance when treatment was started at 24 h, but not when started at 4 weeks. Ro 48-5695 had no effect on proteinuria. These observations suggest that ET-receptor activation does not play a major role in the progression of glomerular sclerosis in this model of chronic renal failure.", 
    "705": "It has been shown that a brief period of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in growing spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) induces long-term decrease of the blood pressure (BP) level. This study assessed whether persistent effects of ACE inhibition could be disclosed in Lyon genetically hypertensive (LH) rats treated from conception to age 3 weeks. ACE inhibition was obtained with captopril (100 mg/kg/24 h in the drinking water of the breeders) because this compound crosses the placental barrier. For each of the six treated pairs, the first litter was discarded, the second served as control, whereas the third and the fourth were obtained during captopril treatment. Six other pairs remained untreated. Aortic BP was beat-to-beat recorded in freely moving 14-week-old rats. It was observed that captopril reduced the number of newborns (42 in the second vs. 17 rats in the third litter of six LH pairs). BP and left ventricle weight did not differ between control and treated animals. It is concluded that, unlike SHRs, in LH rats, ACE inhibition is devoid of persistent effects on BP after cessation of the treatment.",

To investigate the metabolic and antihypertensive effects of temocapril in diabetic hypertensives, 30 patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and mild to moderate hypertension [diastolic blood pressure (BP) 90-115 mm Hg] and without azotemia (plasma creatinine < 180 microM) were evaluated in a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. After a 4-week placebo run-in, they received temocapril, 20 mg daily (n = 19), or placebo (n = 11) for 6 weeks. Insulin sensitivity index (SI), determined by the Minimal Model method of Bergman, serum lipoproteins, plasma renin activity, fibrinogen, and microalbuminuria were assessed at the end of the placebo run-in phase and the double-blind treatment phases. Temocapril but not placebo administration produced a significant decrease in supine BP (152/92+/-5/3 vs. 162/98+/-5/2 mm Hg; p < 0.01) and increase in plasma renin (p < 0.05). Variation of SI during temocapril treatment did not reach statistical significance (0.95+/-0.2 before vs. 1.44+/-0.4 x 10(-4)/min/mU/L after treatment). During administration of temocapril or placebo, no significant changes in fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and serum levels of total triglycerides, cholesterol, lipoprotein cholesterol fractions, or fibrinogen were observed. Microalbuminuria decreased significantly on temocapril treatment (49+/-10 vs. 79+/-17 mg/24 h; p < 0.01) but not on placebo. These findings demonstrate that in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, short-term treatment with temocapril is neutral to insulin sensitivity, lipoprotein metabolism, and fibrinogen, and significantly reduces microalbuminuria.", 
    "707": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, benazepril, and an angiotensin receptor antagonist, valsartan, would decrease atherosclerotic severity in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Male rabbits were fed either: (a) normal rabbit chow; (b) 2% cholesterol diet; (c) 2% cholesterol diet supplemented by benazepril (3 mg/kg per day, subcutaneous injection); or (d) 2% cholesterol diet supplemented by valsartan (1 mg/kg per day, subcutaneous injection). After 12 weeks, the arteries were harvested for histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry. We observed that decreases in serum triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) and ACE activity with benazepril-treatment were more than 60, 30, and 84%, respectively, in comparison with the cholesterol group; with valsartan-treatment, TG levels were 53% lower than in the cholesterol group, however, there was no significant difference in TC and ACE activity. The percentage of aortic surface atherosclerotic area, intimal thickness and the ratio of aortic intimal area to medial area were about 40% lower in the benazepril-treated group in comparison with those of the cholesterol group; the difference was more than 60% in the thoracic aorta. The valsartan-treated group had 23% less atherosclerotic area, less effective than benazepril treatment. The percent of PCNA-positive cells and the number of intimal proliferative cells/mm2 were significantly less in the benazepril-treated group compared with the cholesterol group (by 55 and 63%); these parameters were 35 and 17% lower, respectively, with valsartan. The ratio of proliferating macrophages to smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was 3:1 in the cholesterol group, 1:1 in the benazepril and 2:1 in the valsartan-treated group. These results indicate that benazepril could reduce atherosclerotic progression by decreasing macrophage proliferation and accumulation in the arterial wall. The mechanisms for reducing atherosclerotic progression by benazepril and valsartan may be related to reduction of TG and blockade of the angiotensin II action.",

The secondary objective was to compare antihypertensive efficacy between treatments. This paper reports the results of a prespecified subgroup analysis performed in the 40 black patients recruited into the study. Eprosartan was titrated from 200 mg b.i.d. to 300 mg b.i.d. and enalapril from 5 mg o.d. to 20 mg o.d. over 12 weeks.

Patients received the maximum titrated dosage during the maintenance phase. In the study overall, the incidence of cough at monotherapy endpoint was significantly higher in the enalapril-treated group than in the eprosartan-treated group (p = 0.018). This trend was reflected in the black subgroup but the numbers were too small to confirm significance. At study endpoint the mean change in SitDBP was -10.5 +/- 1.9 mmHg and -9.6 +/- 2.4 mmHg for eprosartan-treated and enalapril-treated patients, respectively. The mean change in SitSBP for eprosartan-treated black patients was -18.8 +/- 3.5 mmHg and for enalapril-treated patients was -10.5 +/- 3.7 mmHg. The black subpopulation mirrored the response of the study as a whole. Both treatments lowered BP with a further reduction evident following the addition of HCTZ at week 18. In conclusion, eprosartan is effective and appears to be safe in black hypertensive patients. The combination of eprosartan and HCTZ was also well tolerated and provided additional efficacy in those patients not responding to eprosartan alone. The incidence of treatment-associated cough in the black subgroup was low, but there were no apparent differences between treatment groups.",

Measurement of mean plasma neurohormone levels showed significant increases in renin activity in both groups and statistically significant A-II elevations in the eprosartan group (p < 0.05). Neither eprosartan nor enalapril significantly altered serum lipid profiles or electrolyte levels. Most adverse experiences reported throughout the study were mild or moderate in both treatment groups. Fewer patients receiving eprosartan (4.9%) than enalapril (9.1%) discontinued treatment because of adverse experiences.

At the end of the study, eprosartan and enalapril were found to have caused similar reductions in BP. There was an increase in CFR in the eprosartan group to 1.6 +/- 0.3 and a decrease in CFR in the enalapril group to 1.3 +/- 0.3. Neither value was significantly different from baseline although the difference between the two groups was significant (p = 0.05). By study endpoint, there was a significant reduction in LV mass in the enalapril group (p = 0.05), but not the eprosartan (p = ns) group.

Comparable data from the US (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study [US-ARIC]) and Poland (Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease project [Pol-MONICA]) were developed. From 1987 through 1993, a total of 3,694 patients were hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction events in the 2 Pol-MONICA communities and 4,801 in the 4 US-ARIC communities. Patients in the US-ARIC were 1.7 times more likely to be treated in a coronary care unit and received cardiac procedures, calcium channel blockers, and thrombolytic agents significantly more often than patients in the Pol-MONICA. The use of antiplatelet agents, nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockade agents was similar in both countries. Case fatality (28-day) rates after hospitalized acute myocardial infarction were nearly identical (men, 7% in Pol-MONICA vs 6% in US-ARIC; women, 9% in Pol-MONICA vs 8% in US-ARIC). However, when fatal coronary heart disease events not associated with a hospitalized myocardial infarction were included, the US-ARIC rates were less than half than those seen in Pol-MONICA. Substantial differences in treatment of hospitalized acute myocardial infarction between countries did not translate into a survival advantage for patients reaching clinical attention. Differences in case severity, arising from the high out-of-hospital coronary death rate in Poland may play an important role in this finding.", 
    "721": "The association of anemia and hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism (HRHA) in type 1 diabetes has been described, and erythropoietin deficiency has been proposed as the cause. Subjects with type 1 diabetes with (n = 8) and without HRHA (n = 11) were studied, as were subjects taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs; n = 10). Renal function and sodium excretion were estimated with a 24-hour urine collection. Values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum erythropoietin, and red blood cell volume were determined. HRHA subjects were anemic (hemoglobin, 99 +/- 8 g/L ), and ACEI subjects had lower hemoglobin concentrations (120 +/- 4 g/L) compared with controls (134 +/- 3 g/L; P < 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively). Also, the red cell mass in patients with HRHA was significantly less than that in controls (14.8 +/- 1.4 v 20.8 +/- 1.1 mL/kg; P = 0.004), indicating that the lower hemoglobin level in HRHA is not attributable to an expansion of extracellular volume. Erythropoietin levels in the HRHA (27% +/- 11% of predicted) and ACEI groups (43% +/- 9% of predicted) were low compared with controls (94% +/- 13% of predicted; P = 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively). Renal function was greater than the levels at which anemia becomes a clinical feature in all groups, but creatinine clearance was less in the HRHA (63 +/- 12 mL/min/1.73 m2) and ACEI groups (76 +/- 11 mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with controls (123 +/- 9 mL/min/1.73 m2; P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). The fractional sodium reabsorption was decreased in HRHA (98.7% +/- 0.3%) and ACEI groups (98.7% +/- 0.3%) versus controls (99.4% +/- 0.1%; P = 0.007 and P = 0.01, respectively). Subjects with type 1 diabetes with HRHA had low hemoglobin concentrations that were caused, at least in part, by inappropriately low serum erythropoietin levels.", 
    "722": "Metabolic acidosis is almost invariably a consequence of advanced renal failure, although its severity can vary widely. To evaluate the determinants of the severity of metabolic acidosis, with special interest in determining if there is any difference in the prevalence and severity of metabolic acidosis between patients with and without diabetes, 113 predialysis patients with renal failure were studied. Criteria for inclusion onto the study were: creatinine clearance (Ccr)/1.73 m2 less than 30 mL/min, no alkali therapy within the previous 30 days, and the absence of respiratory diseases. Forty-eight patients had diabetes (33 patients with diabetic nephropathy). The following data were analyzed: demographics; cause of renal failure; hematocrit; serum urea, creatinine, uric acid, albumin, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase levels; anion gap; urinary protein excretion; Ccr/1.73 m2; half of the sum of creatinine and urea clearances (Ccr-Cu); protein-equivalent nitrogen appearance (PNA); and whether the patients received diuretics (75 patients), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (54 patients), and/or calcium channel blockers (55 patients). After the exclusion of eight patients because of hypochloremia (three patients with and five patients without diabetes), mean serum bicarbonate levels were significantly greater in patients with diabetes than in the rest of the patients (20.7 +/- 2.3 v 18.2 +/- 2. 3 mmol/L; P = 0.0001). The mean anion gap (mmol/L) was also significantly less in patients with than without diabetes (19.70 +/- 3.65 v 22.35 +/- 3.64; P = 0.003). Eleven of 105 patients had serum bicarbonate levels of 23 mmol/L or greater (9 patients with and 2 patients without diabetes). Pure elevated anion gap followed by mixed (high anion gap and hyperchloremia) were the most common types of metabolic acidosis observed in both groups. There were no differences in PNA, diuretic treatment, or vomiting history between patients with and without diabetes. By multiple logistic regression analysis, the best determinants for a serum bicarbonate level greater than 19 mmol/L were: the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy (odds ratio, 0.107; P = 0.0002), Ccr-Cu (odds ratio, 0.824; P = 0. 014), and age (odds ratio, 0.966; P = 0.046). In conclusion, patients with diabetes with advanced renal failure showed a less severe metabolic acidosis, which cannot be explained by gastrointestinal hydrogen ion losses, drugs, or reduced protein catabolic rate. Patients with diabetes may have a more efficient extrarenal generation of bicarbonate than end-stage renal failure patients without diabetes.", 
    "723": "We tested the hypothesis that the combination of converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) with losartan (LOS) produces a more profound antiproteinuric effect than either drug alone in normotensive patients with immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. Eight normotensive (mean blood pressure, 88.9 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy, nonnephrotic proteinuria (protein, 1 to 3 g/d), and normal or slightly reduced creatinine clearance (range, 69 to 119 mL/min) were studied. Clinical evaluations and laboratory tests were performed (1) before CEI treatment (basal) and after (2) CEI alone (CEI, 12 weeks); (3) the combination of CEI and LOS, the latter at a dosage of 50 mg/d (CEI + LOS, 4 weeks); (4) LOS alone (LOS; 50 mg/d; 12 weeks); (5) the combination of LOS and CEI (LOS + CEI, 4 weeks, at the same dosage as CEI + LOS); and (6) a doubled dose of either CEI alone or LOS alone for 4 weeks. CEI and LOS as monotherapy significantly reduced proteinuria by 38% and 30%, respectively. No further reduction of proteinuria was achieved by doubling the dose of CEI or LOS. Both combinations induced a more remarkable reduction of proteinuria (73%; P < 0.05 v other periods) than either drug administered alone. The antiproteinuric effect of CEI or LOS and the more remarkable effect achieved with both combinations was not dependent on the reduction of blood pressure and/or creatinine clearance. In conclusion, this study provides first-time evidence that the combination of CEI and LOS in normotensive patients with IgA nephropathy produces a more profound decrease in proteinuria than either drug. This additive antiproteinuric effect is not dependent on changes in systemic blood pressure and creatinine clearance. Nevertheless, a larger controlled study is required to confirm this novel observation.", 
    "724": "Disseminated cholesterol crystal embolism (CCE) is a devastating complication of atherosclerosis that is often considered beyond therapeutic resources. We designed and implemented a treatment protocol based on an analysis of the main causes of death in disseminated CCE with renal involvement. From 1985 to 1996, we applied this protocol in 67 consecutive atherosclerotic patients admitted to our renal intensive care unit for acute renal failure (serum creatinine level, 6 +/- 2.5 mg/dL) accompanied by signs and symptoms of CCE. The other principal clinical features in these patients were cardiac failure with pulmonary edema (61%), gastrointestinal ischemia (33%), cutaneous ischemia (90%), and retinal cholesterol embolism (22%). Disseminated CCE followed one or several precipitating factors, including angiographic procedure(s) (85%), anticoagulant treatment (76%), and cardiovascular surgery (33%). Our treatment schedule systematically addressed the identified causes of death in these patients. (1) To avoid CCE recurrence, any form of anticoagulant treatment was withdrawn, and aortic catheterization and surgery were proscribed. (2) To treat or prevent cardiac failure, a high-dose vasodilator regimen was instituted, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In case of cardiac failure refractory to vasodilators, loop diuretics were added and, if necessary, overhydration was corrected by ultrafiltration/hemodialysis (11 patients). (3) To avoid cachexia, severe metabolic disorders were treated by hemodialysis (41 patients), and special attention was given to providing enteral or parenteral nutritional support. Patients with declining general status and laboratory evidence of inflammation, as well as those with new episodes of CCE, were treated with corticosteroids. Statistical analysis found a significant correlation between the requirement for hemodialysis and previous anticoagulation, degree of renal insufficiency, and severity of cardiac failure. Conversely, there was no correlation between requirement for hemodialysis and ACE inhibitor treatment or presence of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis/thrombosis. The inhospital mortality rate was 16%. There were no clinical or laboratory elements found on admission that were predictive of inhospital mortality. Among survivors, 32% had to remain on maintenance hemodialysis therapy for irreversible chronic renal failure. Including initial hospitalization, the 1-year survival rate was 87%, which compares favorably with reports in the literature indicating a first-year mortality rate of 64% to 81%. Overall follow-up was 19 +/- 20 months, ranging from 1 to 74 months. The 4-year survival rate was 52%. We conclude that an intensive-care, specific-treatment schedule reduces mortality in multivisceral cholesterol embolism.",

Data regarding medical history, complications during hospitalization, MI extent (Q wave or non-Q wave), infarct location and diagnostic and revascularization procedures were also recorded. This study is based on the 850 patients who met the diagnostic criteria for initial acute MI in the period examined. Among 850 patients with myocardial infarction enrolled 408 (48%) received thrombolytic therapy. The median time interval from symptom onset to initiation of thrombolytic therapy was 196 min. The most commonly used thrombolytic agent was streptokinase (93%). Thrombolytic recipients were younger, and presented sooner after onset of symptoms. Among patients receiving thrombolytic therapy, concomitant pharmacotherapy included aspirin (95%), intravenous heparin (93%), intravenous nitroglycerin (91%), oral beta-blockers (44%), calcium channel antagonists (13%), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (41%). The lipid lowering therapy was only used in 4% of all patients, and was given to 18% of patients with hyperlipidemia.",

    "728": "Although hyperlipidemia has been associated with the progression of glomerulosclerosis, little attention has been directed toward the use of lipid-lowering agents in altering diabetic nephropathy. We tested the hypothesis that lovastatin and the combination of lovastatin and enalapril would preserve renal function in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Five groups of animals were studied: group 1, nondiabetic (n = 10); group 2, diabetic, insulin only (n = 12); group 3, lovastatin, (15 mg/kg/day, n = 13); group 4, enalapril, (50 mg/L drinking water, n = 10) and group 5, lovastatin plus enalapril, (n = 14). After 8 weeks of treatment, glomerular filtration rate (GFR, insulin clearance) was measured in anesthetized animals. The diabetic group was characterized by a GFR of 0.18 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g of kidney weight (gKW), a blood glucose level of 441 +/- 36 mg/dL, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels of 64 +/- 6.0 and 103 +/- 26.0 mg/dL. Lovastatin preserved GFR, 0.52 +/- 0.06 ml/min/gKW compared with the diabetic control subjects (P < 0.05). Enalapril also maintained GFR (0.42 +/- 0.06 ml/min/gKW, P < 0.05). In the lovastatin plus enalapril group, GFR (0.62 +/- 0.05 ml/min/gKW) was greater than in the enalapril group (P < 0.05), but was not different from the lovastatin group. Plasma lipid levels were not altered in any of the groups. Assessment of the kidneys by histology after treatment showed that the mesangial matrix injury score was better in the lovastatin, enalapril, and lovastatin plus enalapril groups compared with the diabetic group (P < 0.05). Lovastatin, enalapril, and lovastatin plus enalapril abrogated the decline in GFR and glomerular injury in diabetic rats. Lovastatin's direct renal protective effect seems to be independent of its lipid-lowering properties.",

A stepwise analysis of variance, based on a model fitted with several different variables, identified baseline (sALDO) and captopril-suppressed plasma aldosterone (cALDO), supine plasma renin activity (sPRA) and K+ as the most informative. Therefore, two models of logistic MDA with sPRA, K+, and either sALDO (model A) or cALDO (model B) were developed and used. ROC analysis was also performed to assess the optimal cut-off values.",

However, at both institutions most patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) were also detected.",

Furthermore, it was proven to be accurate and applicable to patients tested with similar modalities at a different institution. Although this approach did not provide a clear-cut discrimination of Conn's adenoma from idiopathic hyperaldosteronism, it may avoid unnecessary and costly further testing in patients with a low probability of primary aldosteronism.", 
    "735": "Endothelial function is defective in hypercholesterolaemia, and animal models have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may prevent arterial damage. We studied the effect of 6 months treatment with lisinopril on endothelial function in a group of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Forty patients were studied. Forearm blood flow responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. Subjects were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either lisinopril, 20 mg/day (n=20), or placebo (n=20) for 6 months. Plethysmography was then repeated. Baseline variables between groups were comparable. In the lisinopril group blood pressure fell significantly [systolic: 145+/-4 to 128+/-4 mmHg (P<0.001); diastolic: 84+/-2 to 74+/-2 mmHg (P<0.001)]. An improvement was found in the vasodilatory response (expressed as a ratio of the infused/control arm) to acetylcholine, e.g. 3.33+/-0.3 (pre) versus 4.45+/-0.48 (post) at 30 microg/ml (P<0.03), and also to nitroprusside, e.g. 3.0+/-0.2 (pre) versus 3.86+/-0.3 (post) at 3.2 microg/ml (P<0.01). In the placebo group vasodilatation did not change significantly in response to acetylcholine, and nitroprusside responses were unchanged. The data presented suggest that 6 months of lisinopril therapy have a beneficial effect on arterial function in subjects with hyperlipidaemia. Further work should now investigate whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are beneficial in reducing mortality and morbidity in hypercholesterolaemia.",

The results were analysed to determine whether observed differences between countries could be explained by differences in the patients recruited. 1825 patients were studied (range 81-427 per country). By trial protocol, most patients were treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (92%) and all with diuretics, but the proportion of patients taking high doses of these drugs was markedly different between countries. Large differences were also observed in the use of digoxin (overall 64%, 39% in the U.K. to 87% in Germany) and antiarrhythmics (overall 25%, with the highest use 44% in France). The use of beta-blockers and calcium antagonists was low (overall 6% and 8%, respectively), but also different between countries. Anticoagulants (overall 43%) were used in many patients in the Netherlands and Switzerland (around 70%), while antiplatelets (overall use 30%) were most often prescribed in Denmark (51%).",

Because recent evidence suggests that ACE inhibitors may also interfere with B2 kinin receptor signaling and thus enhance the vascular response to bradykinin, we examined whether the distribution of B2 kinin receptors within the plasma membrane of native endothelial cells is affected by an ACE inhibitor.", 
    "743": "Localization of the B2 kinin receptor in membranes prepared from native porcine aortic endothelial cells was evaluated by means of specific [3H]bradykinin binding and immunoprecipitation of the B2 receptor from isolated membranes. Effects of bradykinin and ramiprilat on intracellular signaling were determined by monitoring the activation of the extracellularly regulated kinases Erk1 and Erk2 as well as [Ca2+]i increases in fura 2-loaded endothelial cells. Stimulation of native endothelial cells with bradykinin 100 nmol/L resulted in the time-dependent sequestration of the B2 receptor to caveolin-rich (CR) membranes, which was maximal after 5 minutes. Pretreatment with ramiprilat 100 nmol/L for 15 minutes significantly attenuated the recovery of B2 kinin receptors in CR membranes while increasing that from membranes lacking caveolin. This effect was not due to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation, because no effect was seen in the presence of an inhibitory concentration of the synthetic ACE substrate hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine. Ramiprilat also decreased [3H]bradykinin binding to CR membranes when applied either before or after bradykinin stimulation. Moreover, ramiprilat resulted in reactivation of the B2 receptor in bradykinin-stimulated cells and induced a second peak in [Ca2+]i and reactivation of Erk1/2.", 
    "744": "The ACE inhibitor ramiprilat interferes with the targeting of the B2 kinin receptor to CR membrane domains in native endothelial cells.

The AT1 receptor is upregulated in vitro by low-density lipoprotein.

AT1-receptor mRNA was quantified by Northern analysis, and AT1-receptor density was measured by radioligand binding assays. Hypercholesterolemia was associated with impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation and increased O2*- production in intact vessels. In vessel homogenates, we found a significant activation of NADH-driven O2*- production in both models of hyperlipidemia. Treatment of cholesterol-fed animals with the AT1-receptor antagonist Bay 10-6734 improved endothelial dysfunction, normalized vascular O2*- and NADH-oxidase activity, decreased macrophage infiltration, and reduced early plaque formation. In the setting of hypercholesterolemia, the aortic AT1 receptor mRNA was upregulated to 166+/-11%, accompanied by a comparable increase in AT1-receptor density.",

Indeed, it is believed that this mechanism is partly responsible for the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. In the heart, enzymes other than ACE may contribute to local degradation of kinins. The purpose of this study was to investigate which enzymes are responsible for the degradation of KD and BK in human heart tissue.", 
    "749": "Cardiac membranes were prepared from the left ventricles of normal (n=5) and failing (n=10) hearts. The patients had end-stage congestive heart failure as the result of coronary heart disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Heart tissue was incubated with KD or BK in the presence or absence of enzyme inhibitors. We found no difference in the enzymes responsible for kinin metabolism or their activities between normal and failing hearts. Thus KD was mostly converted into BK by the aminopeptidase M-like activity. When BK was used as substrate, it was converted into an inactive metabolite BK-(1-7) mostly (80% to 90%) by the neutral endopeptidase (NEP) activity, with ACE unexpectedly playing only a minor role. The low enzymatic activity of ACE in the cardiac membranes, compared with that of NEP, was not due to chronic ACE inhibitor therapy, because the cardiac ACE activities of patients, whether receiving ACE inhibitors or not, and of normal subjects were all equal.", 
    "750": "The present in vitro study shows that in human cardiac membranes, the most critical step in kinin metabolism, that is, inactivation of BK, appears to be mediated mostly by NEP. This observation suggests a role for NEP in the local control of BK concentration in heart tissue. Thus inhibition of cardiac NEP activity could be cardioprotective by elevating the local concentration of BK in the heart.", 
    "751": "Several lines of evidence indicate that proline endopeptidase (PE) could participate to the symptomatology and/or etiology of Alzheimer's disease. Thus, proline endopeptidase appears to contribute to the degradation of neuropeptides involved in learning and memory and could also control the production of the amyloidogenic peptide Abeta. Therefore the design of potent, selective and permeant inhibitors of human PE should lead to potential probes to assess the genuine contribution of this enzyme in Alzheimer's pathology. A novel perhydroindol carboxylic derivative, S17092-1 inhibits the hydrolysis of Z-Gly-Pro-7AMC-hydrolysing activity present in human brain nuclei with a high affinity (Ki = 1 nM) and behaves as a highly potent (Ki = 1.5 nM) inhibitor of partially purified human PE. By contrast, S17092-1 is unable to affect a series of other peptidases including aminopeptidases B and M, dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV, endopeptidases 3.4.24.11, 3.4.24.15, 3.4.24.16, calpains and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Furthermore, we show that the embryonic human kidney 293 cell line displays an intracellular PE-like activity that is blocked after preincubating cells with S17092-1, indicating that this inhibitor penetrates in HEK293 cells and could affect intracellular human PE. Altogether, we establish that S17092-1 behaves as a highly potent, specific and cell permeant inhibitor of human proline endopeptidase and can be seen as a probe to examine PE contribution in Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "752": "The treatment of systemic hypertension in chronic renal disease is now mostly based on the administration of drugs which are able to reduce proteinuria and to slow down the progressive functional deterioration. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), which lower both proteinuria and blood pressure, have emerged as drugs of choice in proteinuric patients with either normal renal function or mild to moderate chronic renal failure. In non proteinuric nephropathies no controlled studies exist demonstrating the superiority of ACEI over other drugs. In these conditions calcium antagonists might also be used. The approach to patients with hypertension and renal disease should always take into consideration the quality of the results that are to be achieved. If the aim is to control blood pressure and to protect other organs at risk, then a variety of drugs can be used. If the aim is to reduce proteinuria and slow down progression, then ACEI, possibly associated with calcium antagonists, are the drugs of choice.", 
    "753": "Fluid retention following reduction in the glomerular filtration rate causes extracellular fluid volume expansion that reduces tubular reabsorption by residual nephrons, thereby maintaining the external sodium balance. The price paid for this is salt-dependent hypertension. Thus, loop diuretics are the best treatment for uremic hypertension. Diuretics are also used in chronic renal failure to treat edema due to nephrotic syndrome and congestive heart failure (CHF). In nephrotics, edema is often refractory to diuretics because of low plasma protein, depletion of the intravascular compartment, decrease in the protein-bound fraction of the diuretic in peritubular blood, and increase in tubular fluid. Thus, higher doses are needed. In uremics with CHF the efficacy of diuretics may be hampered because of the reduced renal blood flow. The association of dopamine (1-1.5 microg/kg body weight/min) may overcome this resistance; improvement in cardiac function by dialysis ultrafiltration may also help. Diuretic resistance is sometimes observed; it may be overcome by the following procedures: in CHF by the use of digitalis and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; by substitution of an ineffective loop diuretic for another one; by using larger doses of diuretic; by intravenous infusion rather than bolus therapy, and by a combination of diuretics acting in different segments of the tubule: loop diuretic+thiazide+amiloride. Intravenous infusion of 20% albumin has also been suggested.",

The filtration capacity was significantly higher in HC (p<0.001). The data point to a normalcy of renal reserve in ESHF which may depend on the chronic use of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "755": "The sympathetic nervous system is a major modulator of cardiovascular function. Over the past three decades, numerous studies, using various methodologies, have reported the existence of a variety of pre- and postsynaptic sympathetic dysfunctions in essential hypertension. Most of these abnormalities facilitate sympathetic neurotransmission, resulting in a chronic increase in the sympathetic tone and reactivity in a significant proportion of hypertensive patients. Chronic sympathetic activation is also associated with major alterations in the balance among postsynaptic adrenergic receptors in cardiovascular tissues. Indeed, an attenuation of beta-adrenergic function and a potentiation of alpha1-adrenergic function has been demonstrated in cardiovascular tissues in hypertensive patients, suggesting the development of a sympathetic postsynaptic alpha1 dominance during the development and evolution of hypertension. Chronic activation of the sympathetic system is deleterious and could contribute to the development of most cardiovascular complications associated with hypertension. One of the major aims of antihypertensive therapy should thus be to attenuate pre- or postsynaptic sympathetic tone. Most antihypertensive drugs have been found to improve either pre- or postsynaptic sympathetic function in hypertensive patients. At the presynaptic level, diuretics were found to increase the liberation of noradrenalin, presumably through baroreflex sympathetic activation. In contrast, beta-blockers were shown to attenuate noradrenalin release from sympathetic nerves by blocking presynaptic facilitatory beta-receptors, thus reducing the sympathetic tone on postsynaptic receptors. Similarly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonists have been found to reduce sympathetic reactivity by acting on the central nervous system, but also by blocking AT1-mediated facilitatory mechanisms located on sympathetic fibres and in the adrenal medulla. Short acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) were found to enhance noradrenalin release from sympathetic nerves, but longer acting CCBs seems to have variable effects. Indeed, while the chronic slow release formulation of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) did not raise circulating noradrenalin levels, treatment with amlodipine increased circulating noradrenalin levels, suggesting that nifedipine GITS is neutral on the sympathetic tone but that amlodipine chronically activates the sympathetic system. At the postsynaptic level, however, dihydropyridine CCBs were shown to attenuate the sympathetic tone on alpha1-adrenoceptors. In conclusion, it appears that most antihypertensive drugs interfere with pre- or postsynaptic sympathetic mechanisms and that these mechanisms could contribute to their hypotensive effects.", 
    "756": "NCI-H295, a human adrenocarcinoma cell line, has been proposed as a model system to define the role of the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of aldosterone production in humans. Because the precise cellular localization of the components of the renin-angiotensin system in human adrenal cortical cells remains unclear, we investigated their localization in this defined cell system. NCI-H295 cells expressed both angiotensinogen and renin as shown by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was not detectable by immunocytochemistry, ACE binding, or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. However, 3.5 mmol/L K+ stimulated the formation of both angiotensin I and angiotensin II 1. 9- and 2.5-fold, respectively, and increased aldosterone release 3. 0-fold. The K+-induced stimulation of aldosterone release was decreased by captopril and enalaprilat (24% and 26%, respectively) and by the angiotensin type 1 (AT1)-receptor antagonist losartan (28%). Angiotensin II-induced stimulation of aldosterone release was abolished by losartan treatment. Specific [125I]Sar1-angiotensin II binding was detected by receptor autoradiography. The binding of [125I]Sar1-angiotensin II was completely displaced by the AT1 antagonist losartan but not by the AT2 receptor ligand PD 123319, confirming the expression of angiotensin II AT1 receptors in NCI-H295 cells. Our results demonstrate that NCI-H295 cells express most of the components of the renin-angiotensin system. Our failure to detect ACE, however, suggests that the production of angiotensin II in NCI-H295 cells may be ACE independent. NCI-H295 cells are able to produce angiotensin II, and K+ increases aldosterone secretion in part through an angiotensin-mediated pathway. The production of angiotensin II in NCI-H295 cells demonstrates that this human cell line can be useful to characterize the role of locally produced angiotensin II in the regulation of aldosterone release.", 
    "757": "The aim of this study was to clarify the differences between the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on smooth muscle and nonmuscle myosin heavy chain isoforms in aortic smooth muscle cells of Wistar-Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats. All 4 myosin heavy chain isoforms are heterogeneously expressed in the smooth muscle cells of the aortic tunica media in 20-week-old rats, and the contractile-type myosin heavy chains are highly expressed in smooth muscle cells of the aortic tunica media compared with the synthetic-type myosin heavy chains. Both the AT1 receptor antagonist and the ACE inhibitor had the same effects on hemodynamics, smooth muscle cell hypertrophy and proliferation, fibrosis, and vascular remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats. However, the AT1 receptor antagonist had a more potent effect on the downregulation of the synthetic-type myosin heavy chains than the ACE inhibitor in spontaneously hypertensive rat aortic tunica media. In contrast, these effects of the AT1 receptor antagonist and the ACE inhibitor on hemodynamics, morphology, fibrosis, and expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms in smooth muscle cells of the aortic tunica media were not observed in Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, within 6 weeks, the AT1 receptor antagonist might modulate the cellular composition of myosin heavy chain isoforms in smooth muscle cells more efficiently than the ACE inhibitor, without morphological changes in the spontaneously hypertensive rat aorta.", 
    "758": "The purpose of this study was to compare the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan cilexitil (candesartan) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril on cardiac function, assessed by Doppler echocardiography and cardiac gene expression associated with cardiac remodeling, in rats with myocardial infarction. Candesartan or cilazapril was administered after myocardial infarction. At 1 and 4 weeks after myocardial infarction, cardiac function and mRNA expression in noninfarcted myocardium were analyzed. Candesartan and cilazapril equally prevented increases in hypertrophy in noninfarcted myocardium, left ventricular dilatation, and ejection fraction at 4 weeks. The E-wave/A-wave velocity ratio and the rate of E-wave deceleration, measures of diastolic function, increased to 9.2+/-0.6 and 26.3+/-2. 6 m/s2 at 1 week after myocardial infarction. Candesartan and cilazapril, administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day, prevented increases in E-wave/A-wave velocity ratio and E-wave deceleration at 1 and 4 weeks. Candesartan and cilazapril significantly suppressed increased mRNA expression of beta-myosin heavy chain, alpha-skeletal actin, and atrial natriuretic peptide in noninfarcted ventricle at 1 and 4 weeks and expression of collagen I and III at 4 weeks to a similar extent. When given at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day, both candesartan and cilazapril prevented cardiac dysfunction and gene expression to the same extent as when given at 1 mg/kg per day. In conclusion, Doppler echocardiography showed that candesartan and cilazapril equally improved systolic and diastolic function and that ventricular remodeling accompanied modulation of cardiac gene expression.", 
    "759": "1. We studied the effect of intracellular angiotensin II (Ang II) and related peptides on rat aortic contraction, whether this effect is pharmacologically distinguishable from that induced by extracellular stimulation, and determined the Ca2+ source involved. 2. Compounds were delivered into the cytoplasm of de-endothelized aorta rings using multilamellar liposomes. Contractions were normalized to the maximum obtained with phenylephrine (10(-5) M). 3. Intracellular administration of Ang II (incorporation range: 0.01-300 nmol mg(-1)) resulted in a dose-dependent contraction, insensitive to extracellular administration (10(-6) M) of the AT1 receptor antagonist CV11947, the AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319, or the non-selective AT receptor antagonist and partial agonist saralasin ([Sar1,Val5,Ala8]-Ang II (P<0.05). 4. Intracellular administration of CV11947 or PD 123319 right shifted the dose-response curve about 1000 fold or 20 fold, respectively. PD 123319 was only effective if less than 30 nmol mg(-1) Ang II was incorporated. 5. Contraction was partially desensitized to a second intracellular Ang II addition after 45 min (P<0.05). 6. Intracellular administration of Ang I and saralasin also induced contraction (P<0.05). Both responses were sensitive to intracellular CV11947 (P<0.05), but insensitive to PD 123319. The response to Ang I was independent of intracellular captopril. 7. Contraction induced by extracellular application of Ang II and of Ang I was abolished by extracellular pre-treatment with saralasin or CV11947 (P<0.05), but not with PD 123319. Extracellular saralasin induced no contraction. 8. Intracellular Ang II induced contraction was not affected by pre-treatment with heparin filled liposomes, but completely abolished in Ca2+-free external medium. 9. These results support the existence of an intracellular binding site for Ang II in rat aorta. Intracellular stimulation induces contraction dependent on Ca2+-influx but not on Ins(1,4,5)P3 mediated release from intracellular Ca2+-stores. Intracellular Ang I and saralasin induce contraction, possibly via the same binding site. Pharmacological properties of this putative intracellular receptor are clearly different from extracellular stimulated AT1 receptors or intracellular angiotensin receptors postulated in other tissue.", 
    "760": "Good evidence exists that genetic predisposition is a major determinant in the development of renal and cardiovascular complications of diabetes. In particular, the role of familial predisposition is well established in diabetic nephropathy which may cluster within families, both in type I (IDDM) and in type II (NIDDM) diabetes. The genes responsible for predisposition to renal and cardiovascular complications are not known, but those of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are plausible candidates. Beside the large number of studies aimed at evaluating the role of polymorphisms in these genes, particularly in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, in development of renal disease, no clear-cut evidence has been provided until now. Furthermore, a number of trials have shown that ACE-inhibitors (ACEi) may reduce the rate of progression of renal failure. If the RAS genotype were able to foresee the response to ACEi it would provide new strategies for a specific treatment of subjects at higher risk.", 
    "761": "In proteinuric glomerulopathies, the excess traffic of proteins into the renal tubule is a candidate trigger of interstitial inflammatory and immune events leading to progressive injury, and a key target for the renoprotective action of antiproteinuric drugs. Among proteins trafficked to the proximal tubule, the third component of complement (C3) can be activated locally and contribute to inflammation at sites of protein reabsorption. Experiments were performed in rats with renal mass reduction (RMR, 5/6 nephrectomy) with the following aims: (1) to study Ig (IgG) and complement deposition in proximal tubules, and interstitial macrophage infiltration and MHC class II expression at intervals after surgery by double immunofluorescence analysis; (2) to assess whether lisinopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi], 25 mg/L in the drinking water, from either day 1 or day 7) limited IgG and C3 accumulation and interstitial inflammation at day 30. In 7-d remnant kidneys, intracellular staining for both IgG and C3 was detectable in proximal tubules in focal areas; C3 was restricted to IgG-positive tubular cells, and there were no interstitial ED-1 macrophage and MHC II-positive cellular infiltrates. In 14-d and 30-d remnant kidneys, proximal tubular IgG and C3 staining was associated with the appearance of interstitial infiltrates that preferentially localized to areas of tubules positive for both proteins. RMR rats given ACEi had no or limited increases in levels of urinary protein excretion, tubular IgG, and C3 reactivity, and interstitial cellular infiltrates in kidneys at 30 d, even when ACEi was started from day 7 after surgery. These findings document that (1) in RMR, IgG and C3 accumulation in proximal tubular cells is followed by leukocyte infiltration and MHC II overexpression in the adjacent interstitium; (2) ACEi while preventing proteinuria limits both tubular accumulation of IgG and C3 and interstitial inflammation. The data suggest that ACE inhibition can be renoprotective by limiting the early abnormal protein traffic in proximal tubule and consequent deleterious effects of excess protein reabsorption, including the accumulation and local activation of complement as well as the induction of chemokines and endothelin genes known to promote interstitial inflammation and fibrosis.", 
    "762": "The antiproteinuric effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors underscores the importance of a hemodynamic injury and the renin-angiotensin system in the proteinuria of various glomerular diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent promoter of vascular permeability, is induced in mesangial cells by both mechanical stretch and TGF-beta1. This study investigates the effect of TGF-beta blockade, angiotensin II (AngII), and the interaction between AngII and stretch on human mesangial cell VEGF production. Exposure to AngII (1 microM) induced a significant increase in VEGF mRNA and protein levels (1.5+/-0.1 and 1.7+/-0.3, respectively, fold increase over control, P<0.05). The AngII receptor (AT1) antagonist Losartan (10 microM) prevented AngII-induced, but not stretch-induced, VEGF protein secretion (AngII 1.7+/-0.3, AngII + Losartan 1.0+/-0.1, P<0.05; stretch 2.4+/-0.4, stretch + Losartan 2.6+/-0.5). Stretch-induced VEGF production was also unaffected by the addition of an anti-TGF-beta neutralizing antibody (stretch 2.85+/-0.82 versus stretch + anti-TGF-beta 2.84+/-0.01, fold increase over control). Simultaneous exposure to both AngII and stretch for 12 h had an additive effect on VEGF production (AngII 1.6+/-0.1, stretch 2.6+/-0.27, AngII + stretch 3.1+/-0.35). Conversely, preexposure to stretch magnified AngII-induced VEGF protein secretion (unstretched + AngII 1.3+/-0.0, stretched + AngII 1.9+/-0.1, P<0.01) with a parallel 1.5-fold increase in AT1 receptor levels. AngII and stretch can both independently induce VEGF production; in addition, mechanical stretch upregulates the AT1 receptor, enhancing the cellular response to AngII.",

    "770": "Effects of long-term treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on decreased function of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-containing vasodilator nerves (CGRP nerves) in mesenteric resistance artery were investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Eight-week-old SHR were treated for 7 weeks with 0.1% captopril, 0.01% temocapril, 0.05% pindolol or 0.005% hydralazine in drinking water. Long-term treatment with each drug significantly lowered mean blood pressure of SHR. In isolated and perfused mesenteric vascular beds with active tone, periarterial nerve stimulation (PNS) (0.5 to 8 Hz) produced frequency-dependent vasodilations, which were abolished by CGRP(8-37) (CGRP-receptor antagonist) and significantly smaller in SHR than in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats. Treatment of SHR with captopril and temocapril but not with pindolol and hydralazine resulted in significantly greater PNS-induced vasodilation than in non-treated SHR, but ACE-inhibitor treatment did not affect vasodilation induced by exogenous CGRP. In captopril-treated SHR preparations, PNS evoked significantly larger CGRP-like immunoreactive release than in non-treated SHR. In non-treated 15-week-old SHR preparations, direct perfusion of captopril or temocapril (0.1 microM and 1 microM) did not modify frequency-dependent vasodilation in response to PNS. These results suggest that long-term ACE inhibitor treatment prevents or restores CGRP nerve function reduction in SHR."
