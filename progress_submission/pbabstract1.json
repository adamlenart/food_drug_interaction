Drug-induced angioedema is known to occur via mechanisms mediated by histamine, bradykinin, or leukotriene, and an understanding of these mechanisms is crucial in guiding therapeutic decisions. Nonallergic angioedema occurs in patients with genetic variants that affect metabolism or synthesis of bradykinin, substance P, prostaglandins, or leukotrienes, or when patients are taking drugs that have synergistic mechanisms. The mainstay in treatment of nonallergic drug-induced angioedema is cessation of the offending agents.", 
    "1": "Fabry's disease (FD) is a severe congenital metabolic disorder characterized by the deficient activity of lysosomal exoglycohydrolase alpha-galactosidase, characterized by glycosphingolipid deposition in several cells, such as capillary endothelial cells, renal, cardiac, and nerve cells. As a systemic disease leading to a contemporaneous myocardial and renal dysfunction, FD might be an example of cardiorenal syndrome type 5 (CRS-5). Kidney damage is commonly characterized by proteinuria, isosthenuria and altered tubular function when occurs at the second-third decade, azotemia and end-stage renal disease in third-fifth decade. Beyond the irreversible glomerular, tubular and vascular damages, the podocytes foot process effacement is the major cause of kidney dysfunction. Myocardial damage is usually observed with right and left ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias (due to sinus node and conduction system impairment), diastolic dysfunction, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia, fibrosis and cardiac death. The enzymatic replacement therapy is essential for the management of FD, as well as the control of renal (with anti-proteinuric agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors- and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers), brain (coated aspirin, clopidogrel and statins to prevent strokes) and heart complications (calcium channel blockers for ischemic cardiomyopathy, warfarin and amiodarone or cardioverter device for arrhythmias).", 
    "2": "The progression of chronic kidney disease CKD is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Optimal blood pressure control (130 /80mm Hg) represents a main goal of conservative therapy in patients with chronic kidney disease CKD but it is rarely achieved in clinical practice. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are more effective than other drugs in slowing progression of proteinuric CKD. Dietary salt restriction (\u2264100 mEq/die of NaCl) may be useful to correct the extracellular volume expansion. If this intervention fails, hypertension can be treated by thiazide diuretics in patients with mild CKD, whereas loop diuretics at adequate doses are indicated in patients with more advanced CKD.", 
    "3": "RAAS, a major pharmacological target in cardiovascular medicine, is inhibited by pharmacological classes including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-II type 1 blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone receptors antagonists, in addition to the recently introduced direct renin inhibitors (DRIs). However, currently used RAAS inhibitors still cannot achieve their desired effects and are associated with certain drawbacks, such as adverse side effects, incomplete blockage of the system and poor end-organ protection. In this review, we discuss the efficiency and specificity of the current RAAS inhibitors and propose some recommendations for achieving better treatments with better end-organ protection.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 6 July 2017; doi:10.1038/hr.2017.65.", 
    "4": "The beneficial effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists in patients with heart failure secondary to reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are felt to result from prevention of the adverse effects of AII on systemic afterload and renal homeostasis. However, AII can activate the sympathetic nervous system and part of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and AII antagonists may result from their ability to inhibit such activation. We examined the acute effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril (25 mg, n = 9) and the AII receptor antagonist losartan (50 mg, n = 10) on hemodynamics as well as total body and cardiac norepinephrine spillover in patients with chronic HFrEF. Hemodynamic and neurochemical measurements were made at baseline and at 1, 2 and 4 hours after oral dosing. Administration of both drugs caused significant reductions in systemic arterial, cardiac filling and pulmonary artery pressures (P < 0.05 vs baseline). There was no significant difference in the magnitude of those hemodynamic effects. Plasma concentrations of AII were significantly decreased by captopril and increased by losartan (P < 0.05 vs baseline for both). Total body sympathetic activity increased in response to both captopril and losartan (P < 0.05 vs baseline for both), however there was no change in cardiac sympathetic activity in response to either drug. The results of the current study do not support the hypothesis that the acute inhibition of the renin angiotensin system has sympathoinhibitory effects in patients with chronic HFrEF.",

Patients who had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator at the time of trial enrollment were excluded. Weighted multivariable regression was used to examine trends in rates of sudden death over time. Adjusted hazard ratios for sudden death in each trial group were calculated with the use of Cox regression models. The cumulative incidence rates of sudden death were assessed at different time points after randomization and according to the length of time between the diagnosis of heart failure and randomization.",

Such patients were older and were more often male, with an ischemic cause of heart failure and worse cardiac function, than those in whom sudden death did not occur. There was a 44% decline in the rate of sudden death across the trials (P=0.03). The cumulative incidence of sudden death at 90 days after randomization was 2.4% in the earliest trial and 1.0% in the most recent trial.

Patients with acute coronary syndrome may have prolonged QTc as well. To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared the QTc of ACS with acute ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal syndromes in the emergency department (ED). The purpose of our study was to compare the QTc of those with EtOH withdrawal emergencies with patients with ACS in our ED. Our hypothesis was that the QTc would be similarly prolonged in the two cohorts.",

We compared ECG QTc, cardiac medication use, and electrolyte differences. We considered a QTc of >450 ms elevated for men and >470 ms elevated for women based on the literature. Fifty subjects in whom an ECG, serum osmolality, and EtOH level were recorded within 2 hours of one another and who were administered a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment protocol were compared with 203 patients with ACS during the same period. We excluded patients with incomplete data. Medications compared included clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins. ECG QT and QTc, as well as electrolytes, were recorded and compared. Data were extracted by two investigators with a 20% sample re-evaluated by the other extractor as a reliability measure.

There was significantly more use of clopidogrel, acetylsalicylic acid, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins (P < 0.05 for all) in the ACS group compared with the EtOH withdrawal group; however, there was no difference in \u03b2-blocker usage. There was a significantly higher admission rate: 100% of ACS compared with 76% of the EtOH withdrawal group (P < 0.01, diff 24, 95% confidence interval 18-29). Electrolytes were not significantly different in the two groups.",

    "13": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) makes up half of diagnosed heart failure cases and has similar outcomes compared to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) but a discrepancy in knowledge and approach to treatment. HFpEF is diagnosed using the following criteria: symptoms, preserved ejection fraction (greater than 50%), and evidence of abnormal left ventricular filling or relaxation, or diastolic distensibility or stiffness. Studies conducted to examine the efficacy of angiotensin receptor blockers (irbesartan and candesartan), thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone), and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (perindopril) in the treatment of HFpEF, showed moderate efficacy but no clear benefit. Recently, the FDA has approved a novel drug, which combines an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (valsartan) named LCZ696 (entresto) for possible treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. In this article, we will discuss the failure of previous treatment modalities and the promise that LCZ696 (entresto) may hold for treating patients with HFpEF.", 
    "14": "Several medications have been used perioperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in an attempt to improve outcomes. Antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events should generally be discontinued seven to 10 days before surgery to avoid increasing the risk of bleeding, unless the risk of a major adverse cardiac event exceeds the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention should be continued perioperatively, except before procedures with very high bleeding risk, such as intracranial procedures. Antiplatelet drugs should be continued and surgery delayed, if possible, for at least 14 days after percutaneous coronary intervention without stent placement, 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement, and six to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement. Perioperative beta blockers are recommended for patients already receiving these agents, and it is reasonable to consider starting therapy in patients with known or strongly suspected coronary artery disease or who are at high risk of perioperative cardiac events and are undergoing procedures with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Long-term statin therapy should be continued perioperatively or started in patients with clinical indications who are not already receiving statins. Clonidine should not be started perioperatively, but long-term clonidine regimens may be continued. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers generally can be continued perioperatively if patients are hemodynamically stable and have good renal function and normal electrolyte levels.",

Diuretics - 27.9%, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) - 26.8%, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) - 26.8% accounted for most of the adverse reactions seen, notably frequent micturition and headaches (CCB); excessive micturition and dizziness (diuretics); dry irritating cough (ACEI). Notable complaints for all patients using the checklist were increased frequency of micturition, reduction in libido, and headaches. The reactions resulted in the discontinuation and substitution of therapy in 49.5% of the patients.",

The tyrosine kinase inhibitors can increase systemic arterial pressure and impair myocyte contractility. In addition, radiation therapy to the mediastinum or left chest can exacerbate the cardiotoxicity of these anticancer drugs and can also cause accelerated atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure and arrhythmias. Left ventricular ejection fraction measurements are most commonly used to assess cardiac function in patients who receive chemo- or radiation-therapy.

Prevention of hyperkalemia and its associated complications requires careful patient selection, counseling regarding dietary potassium intake, awareness of drug interactions, and regular laboratory surveillance. Recent data suggests that the risk of hyperkalemia may be further moderated through the use of combined angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors, novel MRAs, and novel potassium binding agents. Clinicians should be mindful of the risk of hyperkalemia when prescribing RAAS inhibitors to patients with heart failure. In patients at highest risk, such as those with diabetes, the elderly, and advanced chronic kidney disease, more intensive laboratory surveillance of potassium and creatinine may be required. Novel therapies hold promise for reducing the risk of hyperkalemia and enhancing the tolerability of RAAS antagonists.",

New therapeutic approaches are needed to prevent the onset of heart failure and to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. An optimized therapy of arterial hypertension in patients with risk factors and the use of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in type 2 diabetics are proven strategies to prevent heart failure. The therapeutic options in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are still insufficient. In heart failure with reduced ejection fraction sacubitril/valsartan, the first approved angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor, is superior to an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Whether digitalis affects the prognosis in heart failure remains unclear; however, serum concentration should be targeted at the lower therapeutic range.

An additional control group was sham-dosed. Fortekor PLUS(\u00ae) did not induce any treatment-related effects on body weight, food consumption, neurological, ophthalmologic or physical assessments over the 6-month treatment period. The test article was possibly associated with an increased frequency of occasional vomiting. Fortekor PLUS(\u00ae) was associated with small, but significant, increases in heart rate and reductions in PR and QT intervals, which were assessed by electrocardiography. These effects were most probably related to reflex tachycardia secondary to reduced systemic blood pressure. Statistically significant changes in some clinical pathology variables were noted after test article administration, but were considered to be of no clinical relevance as values remained within reference ranges and/or were not dose-dependent. No treatment-related macroscopic or microscopic findings were observed. In conclusion, Fortekor PLUS(\u00ae) tablets were well tolerated in healthy adult dogs when administered at one, two, and four times the highest recommended dosage for 6\u00a0months.",

Consequent to favorable hemodynamic modification, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blocking (ARB) therapy have proven to be an indispensable aspect of heart failure management with morbidity and mortality benefit. Additionally, progression to end stage renal failure may be halted by renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction. However, concern over the safety of RAAS blockade in presence of renal impairment has led to profound underutilization of these drugs in CHF patients with renal insufficiency.

Combination treatment with an ACE inhibitor may have additional advantages, compared with a thiazide diuretic. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of a short-term treatment with lercanidipine, and to compare two combination treatments: lercanidipine\u00a0+\u00a0enalapril vs. lercanidipine\u00a0+\u00a0hydrochlorothiazide on structural alterations in retinal arterioles, on skin capillary density and on large artery distensibility. Thirty essential hypertension patients are included in the study, and treated for 4\u00a0weeks with lercanidipine 20\u00a0mg per day orally. Then, they were treated for 6\u00a0months with lercanidipine\u00a0+\u00a0enalapril (n\u00a0=\u00a015) or lercanidipine\u00a0+\u00a0hydrochlorothiazide (n\u00a0=\u00a015) combinations. Investigations were performed on basal condition, after appropriate wash out of previous treatments, after 4\u00a0weeks of lercanidipine monotherapy treatment, and at the end of the combination treatment. Non-invasive measurements of wall-to-lumen ratio (WLR) and other morphological parameters of retinal arterioles were performed using either scanning laser Doppler flowmetry or adaptive optics. Capillary density was evaluated by capillaroscopy, while pulse wave velocity was measured, and central blood pressures were assessed by pressure waveform analysis. A significant improvement of WLR and other indices of retinal artery structure is observed with both technical approaches after treatment with lercanidipine alone, with a further improvement after treatment with lercanidipine\u00a0+\u00a0enalapril, while after treatment with lercanidipine\u00a0+\u00a0hydrochlorothiazide, the improvement is partially blunted. Central systolic and diastolic blood pressures are similarly reduced by both therapeutic strategies. Capillary density is increased only after treatment with lercanidipine\u00a0+\u00a0enalapril. In conclusion, lercanidipine both in monotherapy and in combination with enalapril but not with hydrochlorothiazide is able to improve microvascular structure; on the other hand, a decrease in central blood pressure is observed with both therapeutic combinations.",

Guideline-directed medical therapy with standard neurohormonal blockade has been the cornerstone of medical management for many years. Despite aggressive utilization of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, HF hospitalizations and readmissions are common and residual mortality remains high. With the development of two novel medical therapies (sacubitril/valsartan and ivabradine), the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and Heart Failure Society of America released a pharmacologic update to provide guidelines for incorporation of these agents into clinical practice. Although effective via different mechanisms of action, both agents now have a prominent role in risk reduction. HF medical regimens often become quite complex, especially when associated with comorbid conditions, and require frequent follow-up. Providers must be proficient in patient monitoring, medication dose titration, and therapy optimization.

    "51": "In the space environment, the traditional radioprotective principles of time, distance, and shielding become difficult to implement. Additionally, the complex radiation environment inherent in space, the chronic exposure timeframe, and the presence of numerous confounding variables complicate the process of creating appropriate risk models for astronaut exposure. Pharmaceutical options hold tremendous promise to attenuate acute and late effects of radiation exposure in the astronaut population. Pharmaceuticals currently approved for other indications may also offer radiation protection, modulation, or mitigation properties along with a well-established safety profile. Currently there are only three agents which have been clinically approved to be employed for radiation exposure, and these only for very narrow indications. This review identifies a number of agents currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which could warrant further investigation for use in astronauts. Specifically, we examine preclinical and clinical evidence for statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), metformin, calcium channel blockers, \u03b2 adrenergic receptor blockers, fingolimod, N-acetylcysteine, and pentoxifylline as potential radiation countermeasures.McLaughlin MF, Donoviel DB, Jones JA.

    "52": "NO produced by eNOS plays important roles in the cardiovascular system. Alterations in eNOS activity and expression occur in various cardiovascular disorders and eNOS constitutes a therapeutic target. In addition to posttranslational modifications of eNOS that affect eNOS activity, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of eNOS expression also controlls eNOS-derived NO production. Bradykinin is an important determinant of vascular function and participates in the regulation of eNOS activity and expression. A number of currently used drugs or investigational molecules targeting specific ion channels, enzymes or receptors, including dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, AT1 receptor blockers and angiotensin-(1-7), increase eNOS expression and activity. In this context, activation of bradykinin B2 receptors appears to be a common step for these drugs to promote eNOS expression, which certainly contributes to their therapeutic actions.",

New evidence from clinical studies has shown a possible role for brain Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) in both affective and psychotic disorders. Simultaneously, rapidly accumulating data from basic studies indicate effectiveness of central RAS blockade in much broader range of neuropsychiatric disease. Recent findings implicate brain RAS, especially Angiotensin II (Ang II), in neural pathophysiology of mental disorders through neuroendocrine modulation and effects on neurotransmitter release, mostly noradrenaline, acetylcholine and dopamine. The potential effects of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition and angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) blockade on treatment of mental disorders are a matter of considerable interest. This review describes involvement of brain RAS in pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and an intriguing possibilities of improvement in pharmacological treatment outcome, where using angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), goes beyond blood pressure control.", 
    "54": "During the last 25 years angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors spectacularly conquered the field of cardiovascular diseases therapy. Nevertheless, lack of new studies concerning side effects associated with their chronic administration seems to be rather confusing. In our previous research, we proved that the main furnidipines' metabolite (M-2) possess multiple cardioprotective actions. Currently, we compared effects of post-infarction long-term oral treatment with M-2 and captopril on hemodynamic parameters and \"ischemic cardiomyopathy\" development in rats. Myocardial infarction was evoked by permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 35 days. Surviving rats were treated with captopril (2 \u00d7 25 mg/kg) or M-2 (4 mg/kg) from 6th- 35th day. At 35th day rats' hearts were tested on working heart setup, where following parameters were measured: heart rate, preload pressure, aortic systolic and diastolic pressures, aortic maximum rise and fall, aortic and coronary flow, myocardial oxygen consumption and oximetry in perfusate. Subsequently, heart tissue specimens were assessed during morphological estimation. Captopril caused significant heart rate increase and markedly diminished preload pressure in comparison to M-2. Both drugs evoked essential aortic pressure increase. Aortic flow was significantly decreased after M-2, whereas captopril increased this parameter in comparison to M-2. Both agents caused marked coronary flow increase. Morphologic examination in captopril revealed cardiomyopathic process in 70% of hearts, whereas in M-2 this value reached 30%. Neovascularization of post-infarcted myocardium was visible only after M-2 therapy. Concluding, M-2 presented itself as more attractive agent in long-term post-infarction treatment by preventing cardiomyopathy development, angiogenesis stimulation and preserving cardiac performance.", 
    "55": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of blood pressure and blood volume homeostasis. The RAS is primarily comprised of the precursor protein angiotensinogen and the two proteases, renin and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin I (Ang I) is derived from angiotensinogen by renin, but appears to have no biological activity. In contrast, angiotensin II (Ang II) that has a variety of biological functions in the cells is converted from Ang I through removal of two-C-terminal residues by ACE. The physiological effects of Ang II are due to Ang II signaling through specific receptor binding, resulting in muscle contraction leading to increased blood pressure and volume. To modulate RAS, three classes of drugs have been developed: (1) renin inhibitors to prevent angiotensinogen conversion to Ang I, (2) ACE inhibitors, to prevent Ang I processing to Ang II and (3) angiotensin receptor blockers, to inhibit Ang II signaling through its receptor. Studies using the RAS inhibitors and Ang II demonstrated that RAS signaling mediates actions of Ang II in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of specific hematopoietic cell types, especially in the red blood cell lineage. Accumulating evidence indicates that RAS regulates EPO, an essential mediator of red cell production, for human anemia and erythropoiesis in vivo and in vitro. The regulation of EPO expression by Ang II may be responsible for maintaining red blood cell homeostasis. This review highlights the biological roles of RAS for blood cell and EPO homeostasis through Ang II signaling. The molecular mechanism for Ang II-induced EPO production of the cell or tissue type-specific expression is discussed.",

VS is characterized by significant arterial hypotension, normal or high cardiac output, low systemic vascular resistance, and increased requirements for intravenous volume and vasopressors. Tremendous variations exist regarding incidence reported in the literature and management at different institutions; and the incidence of VS is likely significantly higher than many anesthesiologists believe. Thus the aims of this article are to review the pertinent aspects related to VS and alert clinical anesthesiologists to this under-recognized yet very challenging clinical condition. The potential risk factors include blood transfusion, cardiopulmonary bypass, organ transplantation, trauma and sepsis, and use of specific medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Angiotensin-II antagonist, heparin, amiodarone, aprotinin, and protamine. The pathogenesis of VS may have several mechanistic pathways, overproduction of inducible nitric oxide, activation of ATP-dependent K channels, vasopressin V1A-receptor down-regulation, and nuclear factor-\u03baB activation. Current management strategies include intravenous administration of volume and catecholamines, vasopressin, methylene blue and high dose hydroxocobalamin. Other treatment could include ATP-sensitive K channel blocker, nuclear factor-\u03baB inhibitor, indigo carmine, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Ganjiang Huangqin Huanglian Renshen Decoction (GHHRD), a classical TCM prescription for diabetes treatment, was chosen as a model sample to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed strategy. Three bioactive components were successfully screened out from GHHRD. Coptisine was identified as the ligand of \u03b1-glucosidase and baicalin as the ligand of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Berberine was found to be a dual inhibitor of \u03b1-glucosidase and ACE. The results were further verified by enzyme inhibitory assay and molecular docking simulation.

In this regard, this study is aimed to understand the molecular-level interactions of chemical constituents of Clerodendrum colebrookianum Walp., with anti-hypertensive drug targets using computational approaches. The plant has ethno-medicinal importance for the treatment of hypertension and reported to show activity against anti-hypertensive drug targets-Rho-associated coiled-coil protein kinase (ROCK), angiotensin-converting enzyme, and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). Docking studies showed that three chemical constituents (acteoside, martinoside, and osmanthuside \u03b26) out of 21 reported from the plant to interact with the anti-hypertensive drug targets with good glide score. In addition, they formed H-bond interactions with the key residues Met156/Met157 of ROCK I/ROCK II and Gln817 of PDE5.

The present investigation suggests that the anti-hypertensive activity of the plant is due to the interaction of acteoside and osmanthuside \u03b26 with ROCK and PDE5 drug targets.

The diagnosis of renovascular hypertension due to Takaysu arteritis (TA) was made based on an increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and computed tomography (CT) image of bilateral renal artery stenosis was taken. Renal scintigraphy revealed normal perfusion and function of the right kidney and severe reduction of the perfusion and function of the left kidney. Careful drug adjustments significantly improved but did not fully control the blood pressure (BP); further, angioplasty, which showed almost occlusion of the left renal artery opening and the minor narrowing of the right renal artery, failed to regain sufficient BP control. The addition of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, to conventional antihypertensive drugs successfully and safely lowered BP and preserved the renal function.

The importance of the RAS in the development and pathogenesis of cardiovascular, hypertensive and kidney diseases has now been firmly established in clinical trials and practice using renin inhibitors, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, type 1 (AT1) angiotensin II (ANG II) receptor blockers (ARBs), or aldosterone receptor antagonists as major therapeutic drugs. The major mechanisms of actions for these RAS inhibitors or receptor blockers are mediated primarily by blocking the detrimental effects of the classic angiotensinogen/renin/ACE/ANG II/AT1/aldosterone axis. However, the RAS has expanded from this classic axis to include several other complex biochemical and physiological axes, which are derived from the metabolism of this classic axis. Currently, at least five axes of the RAS have been described, with each having its key substrate, enzyme, effector peptide, receptor, and/or downstream signaling pathways. These include the classic angiotensinogen/renin/ACE/ANG II/AT1 receptor, the ANG II/APA/ANG III/AT2/NO/cGMP, the ANG I/ANG II/ACE2/ANG (1-7)/Mas receptor, the prorenin/renin/prorenin receptor (PRR or Atp6ap2)/MAP kinases ERK1/2/V-ATPase, and the ANG III/APN/ANG IV/IRAP/AT4 receptor axes.

The three societies agree on the recommendations about diagnostic tests and on the value of computed tomography and magnetic resonance as the main tools for the diagnosis and follow-up of aortic disease. Concerning to acute aortic syndromes (AAS), American and European GPs recognize intramural hematoma (IMH) as a type of AAS with surgery indication; however Asian guidelines consider IMH a pathological process different from AAS and indicate medical treatment. In thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA), all express the need for an adequate control of cardiovascular risk factors, emphasizing strict control of blood pressure, smoking cessation and recommend the use of beta-blockers and statins. The threshold for asymptomatic repair is 5.5 cm in European and American and 6 cm for Asian PG, with lower thresholds in Marfan and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). As regards the abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the PGs recognize the adequate control of cardiovascular risk factors, but there are differences in class of recommendation on statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers to prevent progression of AAA. For intervention, the threshold diameter in asymptomatic is 5.5 cm but can be reduced to 5 cm in women as recommended by Asian PG. Moreover the specific diseases such as Marfan, BAV, pregnancy or atherosclerosis aortic present specific recommendations with small differences between PGs. In conclusion, PGs are interesting and appropriate documents at present.

    "108": "Background: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of follow-up in renal protection clinics on the prescription of and adherence to cardioprotective drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: We studied stage 4 and 5 CKD patients who initiated follow-up in three renal protection clinics. The prescription pattern of antihypertensive agents (AHA) and lipid-lowering agents (LLAs) was measured as the percentage of patients who are prescribed the agents of interest at a given time. Adherence to drug therapy was defined as the percentage of days, during a pre-defined observation period, in which patients have an on-hand supply of their prescribed medications. Results: A total of 259 CKD patients were enrolled and followed for up to 1 year after referral to renal protection clinics. There was a significant increase in the prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (34-39%), angiotensin II receptor blockers (11-14%), beta-blockers (40-51%), calcium channel blockers (62-74%), diuretics (66-78%) and LLAs (39-47%) during follow-up in the renal protection clinic compared with baseline (P-values\u2009<0.01 for all comparisons). The proportions of patients with good (\u2265\u200980%) and poor (<\u200980%) adherence to AHA (P\u2009=\u20090.41) and LLAs (P\u2009=\u20090.11) were similar in the year preceding and the year following the first visit to the renal protection clinics. Conclusion: Our results suggest that referral and follow-up in a renal protection clinic may increase the prescription of cardioprotective agents in CKD patients, but does not appear to improve adherence to these medications.",

We evaluated the associations between ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) parameters and plasma renin activity (PRA)-to-plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) ratio (RAR) to test renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition in essential hypertensive patients treated with ACE-I or ARB for at least 12 months.",

    "114": "The onset of microalbuminuria (MA) heralds the onset of glomerulopathy in patients with glycogen storage disease (GSD) type I. Unlike tubulopathy, which responds to improved metabolic control, glomerulopathy in GSD I is considered refractory to medical intervention, and it is thought to inexorably progress to overt proteinuria and renal failure. Recent reports of reduced microalbuminuria following strict adherence to therapy counter this view. In contrast to type Ia, little is known regarding the prevalence of kidney disease in GSD Ib, 0, III, VI, and IX. Subjects were evaluated with 24-h urine collections between 2005 and 2014 as part of a longitudinal study of the natural history of GSD. ACE inhibitor therapy (AIT) was commenced after documentation of microalbuminuria. Elevated urine albumin excretion was detected in 23 of 195 GSD Ia patients (11.7%) and six of 45 GSD Ib (13.3%). The median age of onset of microalbuminuria in GSD Ia was 24\u00a0years (range 9-56); in GSD Ib it was 25\u00a0years (range 20-38). Of 14 with GSD Ia who complied with dietary and AIT during the study period, microalbuminuria decreased in 11, in whom metabolic control improved. All 135 patients with the ketotic forms of GSD (0, III, VI and IX) consistently had normal microalbumin excretion. Strict adherence to dietary therapy and maintenance of optimal metabolic control is necessary to halt the progression of GSD Ia glomerulopathy in patients treated with AIT. With optimal care, protein excretion can be reduced and even normalize.",

    "116": "The sequence of events leading to ED is initiated by type I endothelial activation (almost immediately) and type II endothelial activation (over hours, days, and even months), followed by endothelial apoptosis and endothelial necrosis. The fact that ED is a continual cellular event divides this process into reversible ED (endothelial activation) and irreversible ED (endothelial apoptosis and necrosis). This basic research-defined concept may have clinical implications. Although most antihypertensive drugs (ACE inhibitors, statins, etc.) are effective in patients with hypertension and diabetes, some of them have proved to be ineffective, which may partly be attributed to irreversible ED. Even though the etiology of ED consists mainly of asymmetric dimethylarginine, nitric oxide, oxidative stress, and anti-endothelial cell antibodies, many other inducers of ED have been identified. In addition, a distinct role of ED has been reported for each type of CRS in humans.",

    "118": "The therapeutic targeting of prostanoid subtype receptors may slow the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) through mechanisms that are distinct from those of upstream COX inhibition. Here, employing multiple experimental models of CKD, we studied the effects of inhibition of the EP4 receptor, one of four receptor subtypes for the prostanoid prostaglandin E2. In streptozotocin-diabetic endothelial nitric oxide synthase knockout mice, EP4 inhibition attenuated the development of albuminuria, whereas the COX inhibitor indomethacin did not. In Type 2 diabetic db/db mice, EP4 inhibition lowered albuminuria to a level comparable with that of the ACE inhibitor captopril. However, unlike captopril, EP4 inhibition had no effect on blood pressure or hyperfiltration although it did attenuate mesangial matrix accumulation. Indicating a glucose-independent mechanism of action, EP4 inhibition also attenuated proteinuria development and glomerular scarring in non-diabetic rats subjected to surgical renal mass ablation. Finally, in vitro, EP4 inhibition prevented transforming growth factor-\u00df1 induced dedifferentiation of glomerular podocytes. In rodent models of diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, EP4 inhibition attenuated renal injury through mechanisms that were distinct from either broadspectrum COX inhibition or \"standard of care\" renin angiotensin system blockade. EP4 inhibition may represent a viable repurposing opportunity for the treatment of CKD.",

In particular complex chemical matrices may cause difficulties and increase the need for extensive sample preparation. For screening of patients we thus developed a low-tech assay to monitor bradykinin degradation by serum proteases. The bradykinin concentration mirrors the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Dabsylated bradykinin (DBK) and its labeled fragments DBK1-8 and DBK1-5 were visualized by thin-layer chromatography using only 3\u03bcL of serum. Lower DBK1-5 levels indicated reduced ACE activity due to medication (ACE-inhibitors) or disease.

The effect of antihypertensive drug treatments on oxidative stress markers has not been well assessed. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effect of enalapril on oxidative stress markers in hearts of hypertensive rat models such as spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and SHRs administered N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (SHR+L-NAME rats). Male rats were divided into four groups: SHRs, SHR+enalapril (SHR-E) rats, SHR+L-NAME rats, SHR+enalapril+L-NAME (SHRE+L-NAME) rats. Rats (SHREs) were administered enalapril (30 mg kg-1 day-1) in drinking water from week 4 to week 28 and L-NAME (25 mg kg-1 day-1) from week 16 to week 28 in drinking water. At the end of 28 weeks, animals were sacrificed, and their hearts were collected for the assessment of oxidative stress markers and histological examination. Enalapril treatment significantly enhanced the total antioxidant status (TAS) (P < 0.001), reduced the oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH : GSSG) (P < 0.001), and reduced to thibarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (P < 0.001) and protein carbonyl content (PCO) (P < 0.001), which thus reduced the oxidative stress in the heart. The fibrosis areas in SHRs and SHR+L-NAME rats were also markedly reduced. These findings suggest that enalapril might play a protective role in hypertension- and hypertension-induced organ damage.",

HF associated with acute MI should be treated with a loop diuretic. The use of nitrates, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, beta-blockers, digoxin, and positive inotropic drugs; treatment of arrhythmias and mechanical complications; and indications for use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization is discussed.",

Radiation-induced lung injury is a diagnosis of exclusion, since clinical, radiological, or biological pathognomonic evidences do not exist. Investigations should necessarily include a thoracic high resolution CT-scan and lung function tests with a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. No treatment ever really showed efficacy to prevent acute radiation-induced lung injury, or to treat radiation-induced lung fibrosis. The most promising drugs in order to prevent radiation-induced lung injury are amifostine, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and pentoxifylline. Inhibitors of collagen synthesis are currently tested at a pre-clinical stage to limit the radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Regarding available treatments of radiation-induced pneumonitis, corticoids can be considered the cornerstone. However, no standardized program or guidelines concerning the initial dose and the gradual tapering have been scientifically established.

While research continues to yield new functions of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7), the gap between basic research and clinical application of these new findings is widening. As data accumulates on the efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers as drugs of fundamental importance in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal disorders, it is becoming apparent that the achieved clinical benefits is suboptimal and surprisingly no different than what can be achieved with other therapeutic interventions. We discuss this issue and summarize new pathways and mechanisms effecting the synthesis and actions of angiotensin II. The presence of renin-independent non-canonical pathways for angiotensin II production are largely unaffected by agents inhibiting renin angiotensin system activity. Hence, new efforts should be directed to develop drugs that can effectively block the synthesis and/or action of intracellular angiotensin II. Improved drug penetration into cardiac or renal sites of disease, inhibiting chymase the primary angiotensin II forming enzyme in the human heart, and/or inhibiting angiotensinogen synthesis would all be more effective strategies to inhibit the system. Additionally, given the role of angiotensin II in the maintenance of renal homeostatic mechanisms, any new inhibitor should possess greater selectivity of targeting pathogenic angiotensin II signaling processes and thereby limit inappropriate inhibition.",

Studies show that generation of angiotensin-(1-7) by angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its binding to the Mas receptor (MasR) improves glucose homeostasis, partly by enhancing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Thus, islet ACE2 upregulation is viewed as a desirable therapeutic goal. Here, we show that although endogenous islet ACE2 expression is sparse, its inhibition abrogates angiotensin-(1-7)-mediated GSIS. However, a more widely expressed islet peptidase, neprilysin, degrades angiotensin-(1-7) into several peptides. In neprilysin-deficient mouse islets, angiotensin-(1-7) and neprilysin-derived degradation products, angiotensin-(1-4), -(5-7) and -(3-4), failed to enhance GSIS. Conversely, angiotensin-(1-2) enhanced GSIS in both neprilysin-deficient and wild-type islets. Rather than mediating this effect via activation of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), MasR, angiotensin-(1-2) was found to signal via another GPCR, namely GPCR family C group 6 member A (GPRC6A). In conclusion, in islets, intact angiotensin-(1-7) is not the primary mediator of beneficial effects ascribed to the ACE2/angiotensin-(1-7)/MasR axis. Our findings warrant caution for concurrent use of angiotensin-(1-7) compounds and neprilysin inhibitors as therapies for diabetes.",

The model reproduced previously published data on renal functional changes in response to salt-intake, and also predicted that glomerular pressure, a variable that is not easily evaluated clinically but is a key factor in renal injury, increases with salt intake in SS hypertension. We then used the model to generate mechanistic insight into the differential blood pressure and glomerular pressure responses to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers observed in SS and SR hypertension.", 
    "199": "A wealth of evidence has shown that opioid and kinin systems may control proximal defense in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG), a critical panic-associated area. Studies with drugs that interfere with serotonin-mediated neurotransmission suggest that the \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR) synergistically interacts with the 5-HT1A receptor in the dPAG to inhibit escape, a panic-related behavior. A similar inhibitory effect has also been reported after local administration of bradykinin (BK), which is blocked by the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. The latter evidence, points to an interaction between BK and opioids in the dPAG. We further explored the existence of this interaction through the dPAG electrical stimulation model of panic. We also investigated whether intra-dPAG injection of captopril, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that also degrades BK, causes a panicolytic-like effect. Our results showed that intra-dPAG injection of BK inhibited escape performance in a dose-dependent way, and this panicolytic-like effect was blocked by the BK type 2 receptor (B2R) antagonist HOE-140, and by the selective MOR antagonist CTOP. Conversely, the panicolytic-like effect caused by local administration of the selective MOR agonist DAMGO was antagonized by pre-treatment with either CTOP or HOE-140, indicating cross-antagonism between MOR and B2R. Finally, intra-dPAG injection of captopril also impaired escape in a dose-dependent way, and this panicolytic-like effect was blocked by pretreatment with HOE-140, suggesting mediation by endogenous BK. The panicolytic-like effect of captopril indicates that the use of ACE inhibitors in the clinical management of panic disorder may be worth exploring.",

A literature search was conducted in PUBMED to identify peer-reviewed articles using the following keywords: anaphylaxis, ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, food allergy, radiocontrast media, venom allergy, skin testing, and immunotherapy. Some studies show an increased risk of anaphylaxis in patients who are taking ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers, whereas others studies do not show an increased risk. For venom immunotherapy, there are more data supporting the concomitant use of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors in the build-up and maintenance phases. Most of the medical literature is limited to case reports and retrospective data. Prospective controlled trials are needed on this important topic. For those patients at risk of anaphylaxis who lack cardiovascular disease, it is recommended to avoid beta-blockers and possibly ACE inhibitors. However, for those patients with cardiovascular disease, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors have been shown to increase life expectancy. Consideration should be given for the concomitant use of these medications while patients are receiving venom immunotherapy.", 
    "215": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an enlargement of the abdominal aorta. It is a common disease in the elderly, with a prevalence of 1-5%. An AAA is normally asymptomatic, and the diagnosis is often incidental, identified when a patient is examined for other conditions. The major risk of having an AAA is sudden rupture and death caused by massive hemorrhaging. As rupture risk increases with increasing AAA diameter, the current management strategies include regular imaging surveillance and elective repair before rupture occurs. Ruptured AAA (rAAA) carries high mortality, and an identification of a drug or compound with the potential to halt the growth of an AAA and/or reduce the risk of a rAAA is needed. Thus, the aims of this thesis were to examine the clinical impact of treatment with statins (Study I), reninangiotensin system (RAS) blockers (Study II), and low-dose aspirin (ASA)(Study III) on the risk of rAAA and case fatality following rAAA. The thesis is based on three nation-wide, combined case-control and follow-up studies using data from Danish population-based health-care and administrative registries. In Study I (1996-2008), we included 3,691 patients with an incident diagnosis of rAAA (cases). For the risk analyses, we matched 3,584 rAAA cases to 3,584 age- and sex-matched patients with an incident diagnosis of AAA (controls). Current statin use was associated with a lower risk of rAAA, adjusted odds ratio (OR): 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61;0.86), compared to never use of statins. Furthermore, current statin use was associated with a lower 30-day case fatality following rAAA, adjusted mortality rate ratio (MRR): 0.80 (95% CI: 0.68;0.95). In Study II (1996-2012), we identified 4,052 rAAA cases and 10,549 AAA controls. We were unable to demonstrate any association between the current use of either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and the risk of rAAA, adjusted ORs: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.85;1.07) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.79;1.09), respectively. The results were robust in supplemental propensity score matched analyses. Likewise, no association between current use of RAS-blockers and 30-day case fatality was found. In Study III (1996-2012), 4,055 rAAA cases were included. The adjusted OR for the risk of rAAA in ASA users compared to non-users was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86;1.08). However, ASA use was associated with an unfavorable 30-day case fatality, adjusted MRR 1.17 (95% CI: 1.06;1.28), corresponding to an excessive rAAA case fatality in ASA users of nearly 20%. In conclusion, we found an approximately 25% lower risk of rAAA and 20% lower 30-day case fatality in statin-treated patients. Furthermore, we found an almost 20% higher 30-day case fatality following rAAA in ASA treated patients. No association between the use of RAS-blockers and the risk of rAAA or case fatality following rAAA was found. Similarly, we found no association between the use of ASA and the risk of rAAA.",

Co-incubation with zinc sulfate showed no influence on the rh-ACE inhibition by EGCg, whereas it completely counteracted the inhibitory effect of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, a chelating-type ACE inhibitor. Although hydrogen peroxide was produced by the autoxidation of EGCg, hydrogen peroxide itself had little effect on the ACE activity. Conversely, the co-incubation of EGCg with borate or ascorbic acid significantly diminished the EGCg inhibition. A redox-cycling staining experiment revealed that rh-ACE was covalently modified by EGCg. A Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis indicated that EGCg inhibited the ACE activity in a non-competitive manner.

Expert opinion: Preclinical studies have demonstrated that activation of the protective axis of the RAAS represents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating cardiovascular and renal diseases, but there are no clinical trials supporting our expectations. Non-steroidal MRAs might become the third-generation of MRAs for the treatment of heart failure, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease.

One subgroup of bradykinin induced angioedema is angioedema triggered by treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Due to its localization in the head and neck region and its unpredictable course, it is a possibly life-threatening condition. There is not an officially approved treatment for ACE inhibitor induced angioedema. CASE REPORT We present a case of an 83-year-old woman, who presented to our ENT department because of acute swelling of the tongue. On admission, there was no pharyngeal or laryngeal edema and no dyspnea. Treatment with glucocorticoids and antihistamines had no response. The patient had ramipril as regular medication, so we assumed ACE inhibitor induced angioedema and treated consequently with C1-inhibitor (human) 1,500 IU. Nevertheless, swelling was progressive and required intubation. Even after the second specific treatment with icatibant, her angioedema subsided extremely slowly. The patient also had regular treatment with saxagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor, so we assumed that the simultaneous inhibition of two bradykinin degrading enzymes led to a treatment-refractory course of angioedema. CONCLUSIONS General awareness for bradykinin induced angioedema due to regular medication is limited. Our case demonstrated the importance of improving awareness and knowledge about this side effect. We need a better understanding of the pathomechanism to aid in more precise clinical diagnosis. Securing the patient's airway as well as administration of an officially approved therapy is of utmost importance. As the number of patients simultaneously treated with antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs is likely to increase, the incidence of bradykinin mediated drug induced angioedema is likely to increase as well.",

Studies showed that the effector angiotensin II (AngII) alters bone health, while inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-1) preserved these effects. The newly identified Ang1-7 exerts numerous beneficial effects opposing the AngII. Thus, the current study examines the role of Ang1-7 in mediating the osteo-preservative effects of ACEI (captopril) through the G-protein coupled Mas receptor using an ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of osteoporosis. 8 weeks after the surgical procedures, captopril was administered orally (40mgkg(-1) d(-1)), while the specific Mas receptor blocker (A-779) was delivered at infusion rate of 400ngkg(-1)min(-1) for 6 weeks. Bone metabolic markers were measured in serum and urine. Minerals concentrations were quantified in serum, urine and femoral bones by inductive coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Trabecular and cortical morphometry was analyzed in the right distal femurs using micro-CT. Finally, the expressions of RAS peptides, enzymes and receptors along with the receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were determined femurs heads. OVX animals markedly showed altered bone metabolism and mineralization along with disturbed bone micro-structure. Captopril significantly restored the metabolic bone bio-markers and corrected Ca(2+) and P values in urine and bones of estrogen deficient rats. Moreover, the trabecular and cortical morphometric features were repaired by captopril in OVX groups. Captopril also improved the expressions of ACE-2, Ang1-7, Mas and OPG, while abolished OVX-induced up-regulation of ACE-1, AngII, Ang type 1 receptor (AT1R) and RANKL. Inhibition of Ang1-7 cascade by A-779 significantly eradicated captopril protective effects on bone metabolism, mineralization and micro-structure. A-779 also restored OVX effects on RANKL expression and ACE-1/AngII/AT1R cascade and down-regulated OPG expression and ACE-2/Ang1-7/Mas pathway. In line with the clinical observations of the bone-preservative properties following ACE-1 inhibition, local activation of ACE-2/Ang1-7/Mas signaling and suppressed osteoclastogenesis seem responsible for the osteo-preservative effect of captopril, which could offers a potential therapeutic value in treatment of disabling bone and skeletal muscular diseases.",

Nitroprusside is the first drug of choice for initial blood pressure control in 66% of respondents, esmolol in 11%, labetalol in 11%, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are used by 3% of respondents. For oral blood pressure control after discharge from the pediatric intensive care unit, 75% of respondents use ACEIs, 18% use labetalol, and 12% use other beta-blockers (propranolol, carvedilol, atenolol, metoprolol). The systematic review identified 14 articles reporting pharmacological treatment of direct postoperative hypertension following coarctation repair.",

    "265": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used to reduce blood pressure. Here, we examined if ACE is important for the antibacterial effectiveness of neutrophils. ACE knockout mice or mice treated with an ACE inhibitor were more susceptible to bacterial infection by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In contrast, mice over expressing ACE in neutrophils (Neu(ACE) mice) have increased resistance to MRSA, and better in vitro killing of MRSA, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae ACE overexpression increased neutrophil production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following MRSA challenge, an effect independent of the angiotensin II AT1 receptor. Specifically, as compared to wild type mice (WT), there was a marked increase of superoxide generation (greater than 2-fold, p<0.0005) in Neu(ACE) neutrophils following infection while ACE knockout neutrophils decreased superoxide production. Analysis of membrane p47-phox and p67-phox indicates that ACE increases NADPH oxidase activity but does not increase expression of these subunits. Increased ROS generation mediates the enhanced bacterial resistance of Neu(ACE) mice as the enhanced resistance is lost with DPI inhibition. Neu(ACE) granulocytes also have increased neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NET) and IL-1\u03b2 release in response to MRSA. In a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced neutrophil depletion, transfusion of ACE overexpressing neutrophils was superior to WT neutrophils in treating MRSA infection. These data indicate a previously unknown function of ACE in neutrophil anti-bacterial defenses, and suggest caution in the treatment of certain individuals with ACE inhibitors. ACE overexpression in neutrophils may be useful in boosting the immune response to antibiotic resistance bacterial infection.",

The comprehensive management of DKD depends on combined target-therapies for hyperglycemia, hypertension, albuminuria, and hyperlipaemia, etc. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, the most recently developed oral hypoglycemic agents acted on renal proximal tubules, suppress glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion. Besides improvements in glycemic control, they presented excellent performances in direct renoprotective effects and the cardiovascular (CV) safety by decreasing albuminuria and the independent CV risk factors such as body weight and blood pressure, etc. Simultaneous use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers are novel strategies to slow the progression of DKD via reducing inflammatory and fibrotic markers induced by hyperglycaemia more than either drug alone. The available population and animal based studies have described SGLT2 inhibitors plus RAAS blockers.

Sacubitril/valsartan represents a first-in-class drug acting through inhibition of angiotensin receptor and neprilysin, thus modulating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and vasoactive substances such as natriuretic peptides. This approach can be considered a \"paradigm shift\" from neurohumoral inhibition to neurohumoral modulation. Based on the PARADIGM-HF results, the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines proposed a substitution of ACE-inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy rather than an \"add-on\" strategy in HFrEF.

Sixty-five hospitalized patients with acute decompensated HF were included in this study. They were divided into 2 groups; an ARB/ACE-I group (n = 44, who received ARB or ACE-I before the use of tolvaptan) and a non-ARB/ACE-I group (n = 21). There were no significant differences in patient characteristics including medications at baseline between the non-ARB/ACE-I and ARB/ACE-I groups with the exception of the percentages of hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Urinary volume (UV) at baseline in the ARB/ACE-I group was slightly higher than that in the non-ARB/ACE-I group. The increase in UV after the use of tolvaptan in the non-ARB/ACE-I group was significantly higher than that in the ARB/ACE-I group. The cardiothoracic ratio and the reduction in body weight were similar between the groups after tolvaptan use. Finally, in a logistic regression analysis, a response to the use of tolvaptan was independently associated with the non-use of ARB/ACE-I, but not with age, gender, body mass index, loop diuretic, or human arterial natriuretic peptide. In conclusion, tolvaptan alone might induce an increase in UV in decompensated HF patients without ARB/ ACE-I, although the treatment of HF with ARB/ACE-I is the first choice strategy.",

Research in animals and humans has helped our understanding of the mechanisms of chronic kidney disease progression. Current therapeutic strategies to prevent or revert renal disease progression focus on reduction of urinary protein excretion and blood pressure control. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers is the most effective treatment to achieve these purposes in non-diabetic and diabetic proteinuric renal diseases. For those individuals in which nephroprotection by RAS blockade is only partial, sodium-glucose linked cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors could be a promising new class of drugs to provide further renoprotective benefit when added on to RAS blockers.",

Expert opinion: Several lines of evidence suggest that angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin-receptor-blockers (ARBs) and calcium-channel-blockers (CCBs) have beneficial or neutral effects on carbohydrate metabolism, whereas old \u03b2-blockers and thiazide diuretics have not. Renal outcome trials clearly suggest that in proteinuric diabetic CKD ACEIs and ARBs reduce the rate of disease progression. Thus, an ACEI or an ARB, if tolerated, should be the first choice in diabetic individuals, followed by CCBs, vasodilating \u03b2-blockers and diuretics, depending on the individual patient characteristics. Recent studies suggest that the novel antidiabetic class of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors may offer a small reduction in BP together with important decrease in incidence of cardiovascular and renal events in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

A Guideline Adherence Indicator (GAI-3) was calculated for patients with reduced (\u226440%) left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) as number of drugs taken per number of drugs indicated; beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) were considered.",

Stage C patients were older, had a longer duration of CHD, and a higher prevalence of arterial hypertension. Awareness of pre-diagnosed HF was low (19%). Overall GAI-3 of HFrEF patients was 96.4% with a trend towards lower GAI-3 in patients with lower LVEF due to less thorough MRA prescription.",

Overall, pharmacotherapy was fairly well implemented in HFrEF patients, although somewhat worse in patients with more reduced ejection fraction. Two major targets were identified possibly suited to further improve the implementation of HF guidelines: 1) increase patients\u00b4 awareness of diagnosis and importance of HF; and 2) disseminate knowledge about the importance of appropriately implementing the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.",

Across all visits, mean age was 69.2 years, 51.8% were female, and 56.6% were non-Hispanic white. Comorbid coronary artery disease (CAD) was present in 24.3% of visits. Medication use for cardiovascular prevention and symptoms of claudication was low: any antiplatelet therapy in 35.7% (standard error [SE]: 2.7%), statin in 33.1% (SE: 2.4%), ACEI/ARB in 28.4% (SE: 2.0%), and cilostazol in 4.7% (SE: 1.0%) of visits. Exercise or diet counseling was used in 22% (SE: 2.3%) of visits. Among current smokers with PAD, smoking cessation counseling or medication was used in 35.8% (SE: 4.6%) of visits.

However, combining different drugs brought no further benefit while increasing the risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension and acute renal failure. This was so with combining angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptors type 1 antagonists (ARB). Dissimilarly, in animal disease models this dual therapy proved clearly superior to single drug treatment and became the optimal standard regime for comparison with other treatments. This review analyzes the causes of the discrepancy of effects of the dual therapy between animal experiments versus clinical studies, and is focused on the outcomes in chronic kidney disease. Discussed is the role of species differences in RAAS, of the variability of the disease features in humans versus relative stability in animals, of the genetic uniformity in the animals but not in humans, and of the biased publication habits of experimental versus clinical studies. We attempt to understand the causes and reconcile the discordant findings and suggest to what extent dual RAAS inhibition should be continued in animal experiments and why its application in the clinics should be limited to strictly selected groups of patients.",

Awareness of this rare side effect of a common medication is key to avoid delays in diagnosis and unnecessary procedures.", 
    "332": "Pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) are largely derived from animal models. To examine if renin-angiotensin system (RAS) changes in humans are concordant with rodent models, we measured concentration of angiotensinogen (AOG), cathepsin D(CTSD), angiotensin converting enzyme(ACE), ACE2 and enzymatic activities of ACE, ACE2 and aminopeptidase-A in FVB mice 13-20 weeks after streptozotocin (n=9) or vehicle (n=15) and people with longstanding type 1 diabetes, with (n=37) or without (n=81) DKD. In streptozotocin-treated mice, urine AOG and CTSD were 10.4-and 3.0-fold higher than controls, respectively (p-values <0.001). Enzymatic activities of ACE, ACE2 and APA were 6.2-, 3.2- and 18.8-fold higher, respectively, in diabetic animals (p-values <0.001). AngiotensinII was 2.4-fold higher in diabetic animals (p-value 0.017). Compared to people without DKD, those with DKD had higher urine AOG (170 vs. 15\u03bcg/g) and CTSD (147 vs. 31\u03bcg/g). In people with DKD, urine ACE concentration was 1.8-fold higher (1.4vs. 0.8\u03bcg/g without DKD), while its enzymatic activity was 0.6-fold lower (1.0 vs. 1.6 x 10 RFU/g without DKD). Lower ACE activity, not ACE protein concentration, was associated with ACE inhibitor (ACEI) treatment. After adjustment for clinical covariates, AOG, CTSD, ACE concentration and activity remained associated with DKD. In conclusion, in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and humans with DKD, urine concentrations and enzymatic activities of several RAS components are concordantly increased, consistent with enhanced RAS activity and greater angiotensinII formation. ACEI use was associated with a specific reduction in urine ACE activity, not ACE protein concentration, suggesting it may be a marker of exposure to this therapy.",

A global adherence to guidelines score was developed for prescription of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (BBs), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and ivabradine and their dosages. Baseline global adherence score was good in 23% of patients, moderate in 55%, and poor in 22%.

Its prevalence is increasing because of ageing of the population and improved treatment of acute cardiovascular events, despite the efficacy of many therapies for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), \u03b2 blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and advanced device therapies. Combined angiotensin receptor blocker neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) have been associated with improvements in hospital admissions and mortality from heart failure compared with enalapril, and guidelines now recommend substitution of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with ARNIs in appropriate patients. Improved safety of left ventricular assist devices means that these are becoming more commonly used in patients with severe symptoms. Antidiabetic therapies might further improve outcomes in patients with heart failure. New drugs with novel mechanisms of action, such as cardiac myosin activators, are under investigation for patients with heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is a heterogeneous disorder that remains incompletely understood and will continue to increase in prevalence with the ageing population. Although some data suggest that spironolactone might improve outcomes in these patients, no therapy has conclusively shown a significant effect. Hopefully, future studies will address these unmet needs for patients with heart failure. Admissions for acute heart failure continue to increase but, to date, no new therapies have improved clinical outcomes.",

In this study, we researched the interaction of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase in renal carcinogenesis of uninephrectomized rats. A total of 96 rats were stratified into four groups: sham, uninephrectomized, and uninephrectomized treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker. Renal adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and its downstream molecule acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase were detected by immunohistochemistry and western blot at 10\u2009months after uninephrectomy. Meanwhile, we examined renal carcinogenesis by histological transformation and expressions of Ki67 and mutant p53. During the study, fasting lipid profiles were detected dynamically at 3, 6, 8, and 10\u2009months. The results indicated that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase expression in uninephrectomized rats showed 36.8% reduction by immunohistochemistry and 89.73% reduction by western blot. Inversely, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase expression increased 83.3% and 19.07% in parallel to hyperlipidemia at 6, 8, and 10\u2009months. The histopathology of carcinogenesis in remnant kidneys was manifested by atypical proliferation and carcinoma in situ, as well as increased expressions of Ki67 and mutant p53. Intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker significantly prevented the inhibition of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and renal carcinogenesis in uninephrectomized rats. In conclusion, the novel findings suggest that uninephrectomy-induced disturbance in adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway resulted in hyperlipidemia and carcinogenesis in tubular epithelial cells, which may be largely attenuated by renin-angiotensin system blockade, implying the interaction of renin-angiotensin system and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in renal carcinogenesis of uninephrectomized rats.", 
    "345": "Intensive physical exercise may facilitate potassium release from skeletal muscles that may result in hyperkalemia. Commonly used drugs including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and statins increase a risk of hyperkalemia. It is not known whether the effect of these drugs on serum potassium during physical exercise is additive. The study compared the effect of physical exercise on the changes of serum potassium in hypertensive patients receiving ACEI alone or in combination with statin. Eighteen patients with arterial hypertension with normal renal function were included in a prospective placebo-controlled cross-over study. The patients underwent 3 exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer with 55 - 60% of maximum oxygen consumption each lasting 30 minutes, i.e. after being treated with ACEI alone for six months, and then in a random order after the administration of ACEI with statin or ACEI with placebo each time for eight weeks separated by 2-week wash-out. Serum potassium was measured with atomic emission flame spectrometry before and after 15 and 30 minutes exercise and after 30-minute recovery. During the exercise serum potassium concentration increased moderately but significantly during all exercise tests. Mean serum potassium during exercise remained within the normal range. There were no differences in the exercise-induced changes of serum potassium during the exercise tests performed after ACEI combined with statin or with placebo. Addition of statin to ACEI does not increase the risk of hyperkalemia in hypertensive patients with preserved renal function during physical exercise with intensity typical for routine daily activities.",

However, there are limited data addressing the safety and efficacy of \u03b2 blockers in the setting of cocaine use as there is a perceived risk of adverse outcomes. Our aim was to determine if beta-blocker treatment was safe in HF patients with a history of cocaine use compared with HF patients without history of cocaine use. We also examined whether effects differed between cardioselective versus noncardioselective \u03b2 blockers. Ninety systolic HF patients with cocaine use were compared with 177 patients with nonischemic, systolic HF, and no cocaine use. Outcomes were HF readmissions, major adverse cardiovascular events, and death using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, black race, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, renal insufficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Beta-blocker treatment in systolic HF patients with cocaine use did not have significant differences in HF readmissions (hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.1.38), major adverse cardiovascular events (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.09), death (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.34), or all combined outcomes (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.47) compared with beta-blocker treatment in HF patients without cocaine use. Within HF patients with cocaine use, mortality rates (HR 1.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 8.23) were not significantly different between patients treated with noncardioselective versus cardioselective \u03b2 blockers.

    "364": "Cell therapy repair strategies using adult mesenchymal stromal cells have shown promising evidence to prevent cardiac deterioration in rodents even in the absence of robust differentiation of the cells into cardiomyocytes. We tested whether increasing doses of porcine adipose-tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells (pASCs) increase cardiac tissue perfusion in pigs post-myocardial infarction (MI) receiving angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and Beta-blockers similarly to patients. Female pigs were subjected to MI induction by sponge permanent occlusion of left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) generating approximately 10% of injured LV area with minimum hemodynamic impact. We assessed tissue perfusion by real time myocardial perfusion echocardiography (RTMPE) using commercial microbubbles before and following pASCs treatment. Four weeks after the occlusion of the left circumflex artery, we transplanted placebo or pASCs (1, 2 and 4x106 cells/Kg BW) into the myocardium. The highest dose of pASCs increased myocardial vessel number and blood flow in the border (56% and 3.7-fold, respectively) and in the remote area (54% and 3.9-fold, respectively) while the non-perfused scar area decreased (up to 38%). We also found an increase of immature collagen fibers, although the increase in total tissue collagen and types I and III was similar in all groups. Our results provide evidence that pASCs-induced stimulation of tissue perfusion and accumulation of immature collagen fibers attenuates adverse remodeling post-MI beyond the normal beneficial effects associated with ACE inhibition and beta-blockade.", 
    "365": "We aimed to evaluate the effects of the five main classes of antihypertensive agents on the long-term outcome of 313 consecutive patients discharged after acute ischemic stroke (36.4% males, age 78.5 \u00b1 6.3 years). One year after discharge, the functional status [evaluated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS)], the occurrence of cardiovascular events, and vital status were recorded. Patients prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) had lower mRS than patients not prescribed ARBs (1.7 \u00b1 2.0 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 2.5, respectively; p = 0.006). The rates of adverse outcome (mRS 2-6) and cardiovascular events did not differ between patients prescribed each one of the major classes of antihypertensive agents and those not prescribed the respective class. Patients who were prescribed ARBs had lower risk of death during follow-up than patients who did not receive ARBs (9.4 and 26.9%, respectively; p < 0.05). In binary logistic regression analysis, the only independent predictor of all-cause mortality during follow-up was the mRS at discharge (relative risk 1.69, 95% confidence interval 1.25-2.28; p < 0.001). In conclusion, in patients discharged after acute ischemic stroke, administration of ARBs appears to have a more beneficial effect on long-term functional outcome and all-cause mortality than treatment with other classes of antihypertensive agents.",

The current Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines of the Management of Hypertension (JSH 2014) recommends that antihypertensive medication should be initiated concomitantly with lifestyle modification when blood pressure (BP) is \u2a7e130/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg and that target levels of office and home BP should be <130/80\u2009mm\u2009Hg and <125/75\u2009mm\u2009Hg, respectively, in T2DM patients. Considering more favorable metabolic profiles and renoprotective effects than other classes of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are recommended as the first-line therapy for patients with hypertension and T2DM in JSH 2014. However, the target BP and the first-line therapy remain controversial because of the paucity of high-quality evidence with consistency. It is suggested that BP management should be tailored for each patient with T2DM, based on tolerability and considerations of comorbidity.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 27 April 2017; doi:10.1038/hr.2017.55.",

A retrospective study was conducted on patients treated between 2002 and 2015. The use of antiplatelets (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA], ticlopidine, and clopidogrel), oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT), statins and antihypertensives (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACE-I]/angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs], \u03b2-blockers [BB]) administration was evaluated. During the study period, 852 CEAs were performed in 681 (79.9%) asymptomatic patients. Prescription rate increased significantly for ASA (+29.2%), clopidogrel (+10.3%), statins (+60.8%), ACE-I/ARBs (+31.1%), and BB (+19.3%; all Ptrend < .05). No significant modification was observed for ticlopidine and OAT (ticlopidine use was abandoned in the recent years, but this difference was not significant due to the small numbers). A lower medication intake was recorded for symptomatic patients when compared with asymptomatic patients, except for OAT and clopidogrel. Our analysis suggests that medical therapy has changed over the years for patients with carotid stenosis. Although this is a big step toward best medical therapy, preoperative drug therapy remains suboptimal in symptomatic patients.",

It has also been shown that the ACE inhibitor lisinopril, and the natural product curcumin are also beneficial in different models of CKD in rats. We assessed the influence of moderate swimming exercise (SE) on rats with adenine-induced CKD, and tested the possible effects of lisinopril and/or curcumin thereon using several physiological, biochemical, histopathological and immunohistochemical parameters. Rats (either sedentary or subjected to SE) were randomly divided into several groups, and given for five weeks either normal food or food mixed with adenine (0.25% w/w) to induce CKD. Some of these groups were also concomitantly treated orally with curcumin (75 mg/kg), or lisinopril (10 mg/kg) and were subjected to moderate SE (45 min/day three days each week). Rats fed adenine showed the typical biochemical, histopathological signs of CKD such as elevations in blood pressure, urinary albumin / creatinine ratio, and plasma urea, creatinine, indoxyl sulfate and phosphorus. SE, curcumin or lisinopril, given singly, significantly ameliorated all the adenine-induced actions. Administering curcumin or lisinopril with SE improved the histopathology of the kidneys, a salutary effect not seen with SE alone. Combining SE to the nephroprotective agents' curcumin or lisinopril might offer additional nephroprotection.", 
    "373": "Azilsartan (AZL) medoxomil was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2011 for the treatment of hypertension and has shown promising results both in blood pressure (BP) reduction and in tolerability, but has not yet been taken into practice to the same extent as other angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) that have been on the market for a longer period. AZL antagonizes the AT1 receptor for angiotensin II (ANG II), whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to ANG II, but not alternative routes of formation of ANG II. The bioavailability of AZL is about 60% and it has a tmax of 1.5-3\u00a0hr and a half-life of approximately 11\u00a0hr. With its IC50 of 7.4\u00a0nM after 5\u00a0hr of drug washout in radioligand assays, AZL has a tighter and longer-lasting binding to the AT1 receptor by several orders of magnitude than other ARBs, which might lead to a more effective reduction in BP. Clinical studies have revealed that AZL doses of 40 and 80\u00a0mg/day reduce BP significantly better than maximal clinical doses of valsartan or olmesartan, while being well tolerated and exhibiting a spectrum of adverse effects comparable to those of other ARBs. These properties of AZL might lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and thereby reduce mortality rates. However, the existing mortality studies have not found this correlation, which should be further investigated.", 
    "374": "Although it is known that 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) displays vasoprotective activity in mice, as yet the effect of MNA on endothelial function has not been demonstrated in vivo. Here, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we profile the effects of MNA on endothelial phenotype in mice with atherosclerosis (ApoE/LDLR(-/-)) in vivo, in comparison to angiotensin (Ang) -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (perindopril), with known vasoprotective activity. On a biochemical level, we analyzed whether MNA- or perindopril-induced improvement in endothelial function results in changes in ACE/Ang II-ACE2/Ang-(1-7) balance, and L-arginine/asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) ratio. Endothelial function and permeability were evaluated in the brachiocephalic artery (BCA) in 4-month-old ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice that were non-treated or treated for 1 month or 2 months with either MNA (100 mg/kg/day) or perindopril (10 mg/kg/day). The 3D IntraGate(\u00ae)FLASH sequence was used for evaluation of BCA volume changes following acetylcholine (Ach) administration, and for relaxation time (T1) mapping around BCA to assess endothelial permeability using an intravascular contrast agent. Activity of ACE/Ang II and ACE2/Ang-(1-7) pathways as well as metabolites of L-arginine/ADMA pathway were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry-based methods. In non-treated 6-month-old ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice, Ach induced a vasoconstriction in BCA that amounted to -7.2%. 2-month treatment with either MNA or perindopril resulted in the reversal of impaired Ach-induced response to vasodilatation (4.5 and 5.5%, respectively) and a decrease in endothelial permeability (by about 60% for MNA-, as well as perindopril-treated mice). Improvement of endothelial function by MNA and perindopril was in both cases associated with the activation of ACE2/Ang-(1-7) and the inhibition of ACE/Ang II axes as evidenced by an approximately twofold increase in Ang-(1-9) and Ang-(1-7) and a proportional decrease in Ang II and its active metabolites. Finally, MNA and perindopril treatment resulted in an increase in L-arginine/ADMA ratio by 107% (MNA) and 140% (perindopril), as compared to non-treated mice. Functional and biochemical endothelial profiling in ApoE/LDLR(-/-) mice in vivo revealed that 2-month treatment with MNA (100 mg/kg/day) displayed a similar profile of vasoprotective effect as 2-month treatment with perindopril (10 mg/kg/day): i.e., the improvement in endothelial function that was associated with the beneficial changes in ACE/Ang II-ACE2/Ang (1-7) balance and in L-arginine/ADMA ratio in plasma.",

    "380": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to progression of diabetic nephropathy, which promotes end-stage renal failure in diabetic patients. This study was undertaken to investigate the actions of tempol and ramipril, pharmacological agents that target the consequences of NADPH oxidase, on diabetic nephropathy in a rat model of type 1 diabetes, with an emphasis on markers of ER stress. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with a single bolus of streptozotocin (55mg/kg) to induce type 1 diabetes. An additional age-matched group of rats was administered with citrate vehicle as controls. After 4 weeks of untreated diabetes, rats received tempol (1.5mM/kg/day subcutaneously, n=8), ramipril (1mg/kg/day in drinking water, n=8) or remained untreated for an additional 4 weeks (n=7). After 8 weeks of diabetes in total, kidneys were collected for histological analysis, gene expression and protein abundance. Tempol and ramipril blunted diabetes-induced upregulation of NADPH oxidase isoforms (Nox4, Nox2, p47(phox)), accompanied by an amelioration of diabetes-induced glomerular injury (podocin, nephrin, Kim-1), tubulo-interstitial fibrosis (TGF\u03b21, TGF\u03b2-R2, pSMAD3, \u03b1-SMA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, MCP-1, ANX-A1, FPR2) expression. In addition, the diabetes-induced renal ER stress, evidenced by increased expression of GRP-78 chaperone and stress-associated markers ATF4, TRB3, as well as XBP1s, phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and 3-nitrotyrosination, were all attenuated by tempol and ramipril. These observations suggest that antioxidant approaches that blunt NADPH upregulation may attenuate diabetic nephropathy, at least in part by negatively regulating ER stress and inflammation, and hence ameliorating kidney damage.", 
    "381": "Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, e.g. H2O2, nitric oxide) confer redox regulation of essential cellular signaling pathways such as cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and apoptosis. At higher concentrations, ROS and RNS lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage of biomolecules (e.g. via formation of peroxynitrite, fenton chemistry). Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by severe ischemic conditions in the periphery leading to intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia (end stage). It is well known that redox biology and oxidative stress play an important role in this setting. We here discuss the major pathways of oxidative stress and redox signaling underlying the disease progression with special emphasis on the contribution of inflammatory processes. We also highlight therapeutic strategies comprising pharmacological (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibition) and non-pharmacological (e.g. exercise) interventions. Both of these strategies induce potent indirect antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that may contribute to an improvement of PAD associated complications and disease progression by removing excess formation of ROS and RNS (e.g. by ameliorating primary complications such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension) as well as the normalization of the inflammatory phenotype suppressing the progression of atherosclerosis.",

This meta-analysis aims to systematically evaluate the impact of medication adherence on clinical outcomes in patients with stable coronary artery disease. Methods Articles from January 1960-December 2015 were retrieved from the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases without any language restriction. A meta-analysis was performed to investigate the risk ratios of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and myocardial infarction/hospitalization between groups with good medication adherence and poor medication adherence. Studies were independently reviewed by two investigators. Data from eligible studies were extracted, and the meta-analysis was performed using R Version 3.1.0 software. Results A total of 10 studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 106,002 coronary artery disease patients. The results showed that good adherence to evidence-based medication regimens, including \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, antiplatelet drugs, and statins, was related to a lower risk of all-cause mortality(risk ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.69), cardiovascular mortality(risk ratio 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.87), and cardiovascular hospitalization/myocardial infarction(risk ratio 0.61; 95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.82).

    "383": "EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas contain a subpopulation of cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and can grow independently of EGFR. To kill these cancer cells, we need a novel therapeutic approach other than EGFR inhibitors. If a molecule is specifically expressed on the cell surface of such EGFR-independent EGFR-mutant cancer cells, it can be a therapeutic target. We found that a mesenchymal EGFR-independent subline derived from HCC827\u00a0cells, an EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line, expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to a greater extent than its parental cells. ACE2 was also expressed at least partially in most of the primary EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas examined, and the ACE2 expression level in the cancer cells was much higher than that in normal lung epithelial cells. In addition, we developed an anti-ACE2 mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), termed H8R64, that was internalized by ACE2-expressing cells. If an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of a humanized mAb based on H8R64 and a potent anticancer drug were produced, it could be effective for the treatment of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinomas.",

Besides insulin and oral hypoglycaemic drugs, blockage of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) denotes a key pharmacotherapy for the management of cardiovascular (CVD) and chronic kidney diseases (CKD), which are the leading causes of disability and death among diabetic patients. Neprilysin (NEP) inhibition, auxiliary to RAS blockage increases the bioavailability of natriuretic peptides and benefits the cardio-renal system.

The use of Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs) and Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors (ACEIs) to manage hypertension in cancer patients is correlated with improved survival outcomes for renal, prostate, breast and small cell lung cancer. Previous studies demonstrate that the Angiotensin Receptor Type I (AT1R) is linked to breast cancer pathogenesis, with unbiased analysis of gene-expression studies identifying significant up-regulation of AGTR1, the gene encoding AT1R in ER+ve/HER2-ve tumors correlating with poor prognosis. However, there is no evidence, so far, of the functional contribution of AT1R to breast tumorigenesis. We explored the potential therapeutic benefit of ARB in a carcinogen-induced mouse model of breast cancer and clarified the mechanisms associated with its success.Mammary tumors were induced with 7,12-dimethylbenz[\u03b1]antracene (DMBA) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) in female wild type mice and the effects of the ARB, Losartan treatment assessed in a preventative setting (n = 15 per group). Tumor histopathology was characterised by immunohistochemistry, real-time qPCR to detect gene expression signatures, and tumor cytokine levels measured with quantitative bioplex assays. AT1R was detected with radiolabelled ligand binding assays in fresh frozen tumor samples.We showed that therapeutic inhibition of AT1R, with Losartan, resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden; and no mammary tumor incidence in 20% of animals. We observed a significant reduction in tumor progression from DCIS to invasive cancer with Losartan treatment. This was associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation and a significant reduction in IL-6, pSTAT3 and TNF\u03b1 levels. Analysis of tumor immune cell infiltrates, however, demonstrated no significant differences in the recruitment of lymphocytes or tumour-associated macrophages in Losartan or vehicle-treated mammary tumors.Analysis of AT1R expression with radiolabelled ligand binding assays in human breast cancer biopsies showed high AT1R levels in 30% of invasive ductal carcinomas analysed. Furthermore, analysis of the TCGA database identified that high AT1R expression to be associated with luminal breast cancer subtype.Our in vivo data and analysis of human invasive ductal carcinoma samples identify the AT1R is a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer, with the availability of a range of well-tolerated inhibitors currently used in clinics. We describe a novel signalling pathway critical in breast tumorigenesis, that may provide new therapeutic avenues to complement current treatments.",

A meta-analysis was performed to review the effect of PTF plus ACEIs/ARBs vs. ACEIs/ARBs alone on proteinuria and kidney function in CKD. Results Eleven RCTs including 705 patients were retrieved. PTF plus ACEI/ARB treatment significantly decreased proteinuria in patients with CKD within 6 months (standard mean difference [SMD] -0.52; 95% CI -0.90 to 0.15; I(2\u2009)=\u200968%) and significantly attenuated a decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in patients with stages 3-5 CKD after 6 months of treatment (standard mean difference [SMD] 0.30; confidence limit [Cl] 95% CI 0.06 to 0.54; I(2\u2009)=\u20090%).

However, little is known about the effects of long-term statin use prior to PPCI on such outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the present analysis was to clarify the effects of long-term statin use before PPCI on the treatment outcomes of patients following AMI. The records of 213 patients who had AMI and met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: A control group (n=178) who had received no statin pretreatment before AMI onset, and a statin group (n=35) who had received statin treatment for \u22651 month before AMI onset. All patients received a standard treatment regimen for the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease after PPCI. Baseline clinical variables, details of the PPCI procedure and clinical outcomes within 3 months after treatment were reviewed. Patients in the statin group were significantly older than those in the control group (P=0.003). Compared with the control group, there was a greater proportion of patients with hyperlipidemia and previous angina pectoris in the statin group. There were no differences in the use of other drugs (aspirin, \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) prior to PPCI between the two groups. The corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) was significantly lower in the statin group than in the control group (24.1\u00b112.8 vs. 29.4\u00b114.3, respectively; P=0.043). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that long-term statin use before AMI was a significant predictor of cTFC after PPCI (P=0.012). Furthermore, the incidence of major adverse cardiac events within 3 months after PPCI was higher in the control group than in the statin group (16.8 vs. 2.9%, respectively; P=0.032). Logistic regression analysis showed that previous statin use was associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiac events within 3 months after treatment (P=0.012). The results of the present study demonstrate that long-term statin use prior to PPCI improved treatment outcomes after AMI in actual clinical practice.",

While many patients with iliac venous occlusive disease and superficial venous insufficiency improve with combined iliac venous stenting and correction of superficial venous reflux, some patients have symptoms which persist. The goal of this study was to identify clinical factors related to persistent symptoms in patients with leg swelling after treatment of both iliac vein stenting and thermal ablation. Methods This observational study analyzed data for patients who underwent both iliac vein stent placement as well as endovenous ablation (either RFA or EVLT) as a management for chronic venous insufficiency between February 2012 and February 2014. Follow-up was performed after completion of both procedures and inquiring for improvement of swelling. Statistical analysis performed using Chi-square and student's t-test. Results Of the total 173 patients who underwent both endovenous closure and iliac vein stent placements, 55 (31.8%) patients were men; 29 (16%) patients stated they had no improvement after these procedures. The average age of patients who did not improve was 68.8 (\u00b116.7 SD) years and 66.2 (\u00b113.3 SD) years for patients who improved. Over all, the classification of the presenting symptoms by CEAP classification demonstrated 25.4%, 53.2%, 5.8%, and 15.6%, for C3-C6, respectively. There was no correlation with failure to improve the swelling with: age ( P\u2009=\u2009.44), gender ( P\u2009=\u2009.33), presenting symptom ( P\u2009=\u2009.67), use of calcium channel blockers ( P\u2009=\u2009.85), nitroglycerin ( P\u2009=\u2009.86), Plavix ( P\u2009=\u2009.07), aspirin ( P\u2009=\u2009.55), Synthyroid ( P\u2009=\u2009.55), Coumadin ( P\u2009=\u2009.14), angiotensin receptor blocker ( P\u2009=\u2009.81), \u03b2 Blockers ( P\u2009=\u2009.61), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors ( P\u2009=\u2009.88), furosemide 40\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.74), hydrochlorothiazide 12.5\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.07), hydrochlorothiazide 25\u2009mg ( P\u2009=\u2009.48), and EVLT vs. RFA ( P\u2009=\u2009.91). The use of furosemide (20\u2009mg) was associated with continued swelling ( P\u2009=\u2009.01). The use of dual diuretics (furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide) was associated with persistent swelling even after these combined endovenous procedures P\u2009=\u2009.03).

Blueberry leaves are byproducts of the blueberry industry, which are rich in bioactive phenolics, such as quercetin (Q), hyperin (H), and chlorogenic acid (C). This study investigated protective effects of 3 phenolics (Q, H, and C) from leaves of rabbiteye blueberry Vaccinium ashei on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The results showed that all these 3 phenolics could improve endothelial function by inhibiting oxidative damage and proinflammatory cytokines caused by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). The cell vitalities of endothelial cells pretreated with Q, H, and C were higher than those stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 only. These phenolics could decrease reactive oxygen species and xanthine oxidase-1 levels and increase superoxide dismutase and heme oxygenase-1 levels in endothelial cells. They also could decrease the protein expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 induced by TNF-\u03b1. In addition, Q, H, and C also exhibited vasodilatory effect by reducing the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) protein levels in endothelial cells. Mostly 3 phenolics exhibited bioactivities as a function of concentration, but the effects not always depended on the concentration. The antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects of Q seemed to be more pronounced than H; however, H exhibited higher cell vitalities. The results indicated that phenolics from rabbiteye blueberry leaves could be potential antioxidants, inflammation and ACE inhibitors, and rabbiteye blueberry leaves provide a new resources of phytochemicals beneficial for cardiovascular health.",

Following consecutive purification, the potent ACE inhibitory peptide was composed of 7\u00a0amino acids, Thr-Met\u2011Glu\u2011Pro\u2011Gly\u2011Lys-Pro\u00a0(molecular weight,\u00a0759\u00a0Da). Analysis using the Lineweaver-Burk plot and molecular modeling suggested that the purified peptide acted as a mixed non-competitive inhibitor of ACE. The inhibitory effects of the peptide against the cellular production of vascular dysfunction-related factors induced by Ang\u00a0II were also investigated. In human endothelial cells, the Ang\u00a0II-induced production of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species was inhibited, and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase\u00a0(iNOS) and endothelin-1\u00a0(ET-1) was downregulated when the cells were cultured with the purified peptide. Moreover, the peptide blocked the activation of p38\u00a0mitogen\u2011activated protein kinase.

This study was conducted to explore the effect of acarbose addition on the prevention of severe subacute ruminal acidosis induced by either cracked wheat or beet pulp in\u00a0vitro. Cracked wheat and beet pulp were fermented in\u00a0vitro by rumen microorganisms obtained from three dairy cows. When cracked wheat was used as the substrate and fermented for 24\u00a0h, compared with the control, acarbose addition decreased the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, total volatile fatty acids, and lactate (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while linearly increased the ratio of acetate to propionate, pH value, and the ammonia-nitrogen level (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Applying Illumina MiSeq sequencing of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as the ACE (abundance-based coverage estimator) value, Chao 1 value, and Shannon index increased significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while there was a significant reduction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the relative abundance of Tenericutes as well as Proteobacteria after adding acarbose compared to the control. On the other hand, when beet pulp was used as the substrate, acarbose addition had no significant effects (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) on the fermentation parameters and the Chao 1 value, the Shannon index, and the proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In general, these findings indicate that acarbose had more effects on ruminal fermentation when wheat was used as the substrate, whereas it exhibited little effect on ruminal fermentation when beet pulp was used as the substrate.",

A few endogenous vasodilators, kinins, natriuretic peptides, and possibly angiotensin (1-7), exert opposite actions and may provide useful therapeutic agents. As endothelial autacoids, the kinins are potent vasodilators, active natriuretics, and protectors of the endothelium. Indeed, the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS) is considered the dominant mechanism for counteracting the detrimental effects of the hyperactive RAS. The 2 systems, RAS and KKS, are controlled by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) that generates Ang II and inactivates the kinins. Inhibitors of ACE can reduce the impact of Ang II and potentiate the kinins, thus contributing to restore the cardiovascular homeostasis. In the last 20 years, ACE-inhibitors (ACE-Is) have become the drugs of first choice for the treatments of the major CVDs. ACE-Is not only reduce blood pressure, as sartans also do, but by protecting and potentiating the kinins, they can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life for patients with CVDs.

Objective The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence and predictors of medication errors in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Setting the coronary care unit of a university teaching hospital. Methods This was a prospective observational study on 150 patients admitted to the coronary care unit between August 2014 and July 2015. Main outcome measure The principal outcome was the number (frequency) of encountered medication errors. Results Of total 5790 prescription items reviewed, 547 (9.4%) potential medication errors were identified of which 523 (9.0%) were prescribing errors and 24 were monitoring errors. The most frequent prescribing errors were dosing errors (231, 42.2%) followed by loading dose omission error (91, 16.6%), omission of essential drugs on 1st day (43, 7.9%), and timing error (40, 7.3%). Errors frequently encountered with drugs such as aspirin, enoxaparin, beta-blockers followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and clopidogrel. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that renal impairment (OR 6.02; 95% CI 1.4-35.4; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and longer duration of hospital stay (OR 4.01; 95% CI 1.5-10.7; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) were predictors of the higher incidence of medication errors. Conclusion Prescribing and monitoring errors in coronary care unit are frequent and avoidable, with the majority of errors were ranked to be of mild to moderate severity. Dosing errors, omission of essential drugs and monitoring errors were most common error types encountered. Dosage adjustment based on estimation of the glomerular filtration rate immediately after admission help avoiding dosage-related errors.",

This study also aims to determine the effects of benazeprilat on serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), selecting the most appropriate dose that suppresses ACE activity. Six healthy horses in a crossover design received IV benazepril at 0.50mg/kg and PO at doses 0 (placebo), 0.25, 0.50 and 1.00mg/kg. Blood pressures (BP) were measured and blood samples were obtained at different times in order to measure serum drug concentrations and serum ACE activity, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and spectrophotometry, respectively. Systemic bioavailability of benazeprilat after PO benazepril was 3-4%. Maximum ACE inhibitions from baseline were 99.63% (IV benazepril), 6.77% (placebo) and 78.91%, 85.74% and 89.51% (for the three PO benazepril doses). Significant differences in BP were not found.

    "530": "In heart failure (HF), the heart cannot pump blood efficiently and is therefore unable to meet the body's demands of oxygen, and/or there is increased end-diastolic pressure. Current treatments for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotension receptor type 1 (AT1 ) antagonists, \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, aldosterone receptor antagonists, diuretics, digoxin and a combination drug with AT1 receptor antagonist and neprilysin inhibitor. In HF, the risk of readmission for hospital and mortality is markedly higher with a heart rate (HR) above 70 bpm. Here, we review the evidence regarding the use of ivabradine for lowering HR in HF. Ivabradine is a blocker of an I funny current (I(f)) channel and causes rate-dependent inhibition of the pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial node. In clinical trials of HFrEF, treatment with ivabradine seems to improve clinical outcome, for example improved ejection fraction (EF) and less readmission for hospital, but the effect appears most pronounced in patients with HRs above 70 bpm, while the effect on cardiovascular death appears less consistent. The adverse effects of ivabradine include bradycardia, atrial fibrillation and visual disturbances, but ivabradine avoids the negative inotrope effects observed with \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists. In conclusion, in patients with stable HFrEF with EF<35% and HR above 70 bpm, ivabradine improves the outcome and might be a first choice of therapy, if beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are not tolerated. Further studies must show whether that can be extended to HF patients with preserved EF.",

    "545": "In ZDF rats, miR-184 showed the strongest differential upregulation compared with lean rats (18-fold). Tubular localisation of miR-184 was associated with reduced expression of lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3) and collagen accumulation. Transfection of NRK-52E cells with miR-184 mimic reduced LPP3, promoting a profibrotic phenotype. Albumin was a major trigger of miR-184 expression. Anti-miR-184 counteracted albumin-induced LPP3 downregulation and overexpression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. In ZDF rats, ACE-inhibitor treatment limited albuminuria and reduced miR-184, with tubular LPP3 preservation and tubulointerstitial fibrosis amelioration. Albumin-induced miR-184 expression in tubule cells was epigenetically regulated through DNA demethylation and histone lysine acetylation and was accompanied by binding of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit to miR-184 promoter.", 
    "546": "These results suggest that miR-184 may act as a downstream effector of albuminuria through LPP3 to promote tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and offer the rationale to investigate whether targeting miR-184 in association with albuminuria-lowering drugs may be a new strategy to achieve fully anti-fibrotic effects in diabetic nephropathy.",

In the last decades better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying HF has resulted in major breakthrough in the management and improvement in the natural history of this clinical syndrome. Areas covered: The review is focused on current and upcoming pharmacological therapies in patients with chronic and acute HF, starting with brief overview of drugs which improve the outcomes in patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (EF) including neurohormonal antagonists, angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor and If- channel inhibitor, then presenting the summary of symptomatic treatment, the pharmacotherapy in chronic HF with preserved and mid-range EF and in acute HF. Finally, we report the emerging pharmacologic options and ongoing clinical trials and future directions in pharmacotherapy. Expert commentary: The guidelines-recommended therapies in HF with reduced EF need to be widely implemented into the everyday clinical practice. Better clinical characterization of HF with preserved, mid-range EF and acute HF, with better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may ultimately result in a development of effective strategies improving ominous outcomes in these patients.",

Pressure overload was induced by abdominal aortic banding (AB). To evaluate the role of antihypertensive drugs on the effect of Ang-(1-7), AB male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were treated with vehicle or low doses (5 mg\u00b7kg-1\u00b7day-1, gavage) of losartan, captopril, amlodipine, or spironolactone. Isolated aortic rings and isolated perfused hearts under constant flow were used to evaluate the effect of Ang-(1-7) in thoracic aorta and coronary arteries, respectively. Ang-(1-7) induced a significant relaxation in the aorta of sham animals, but this effect was reduced in the aortas of AB rats. Chronic treatments with losartan, captopril or amlodipine, but not with spironolactone, restored the Ang-(1-7)-induced aorta relaxation in AB rats. The coronary vasodilatation evoked by Ang-(1-7) in sham rats was blunted in hypertrophic rats. Only the treatment with losartan restored the coronary vasodilatory effect of Ang-(1-7) in AB rat hearts. These data support a beneficial vascular effect of an association of Ang-(1-7) and some antihypertensive drugs. Thus, this association may have potential as a new therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular diseases.",

Primary outcomes, including death from any cause, and secondary outcomes, including admission for stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, were examined.Compared to the nonuser group, the adjusted HRs for mortality of the nonadherence group and the adherence group were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.86) and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.86-1.13), respectively. Cardiovascular events were more frequent in patients with ESRD receiving ACEIs /ARBs than in nonusers.

Only VW and VY were identified. Further analysis of collected fractions conducted to the identification of 51 different peptides in major fractions. 19 peptides selected were synthesised and tested for their ACE inhibitory potential. TL, TI, IK, LR, LD, IQ, DI, AILE, ALLE, ALIE and AIIE were identified as new ACE inhibitors. The findings from this study point UPLC-MS/MS combined with the creation of a database as an efficient technique to identify specific short peptides within a complex hydrolysate, in addition with de novo sequencing.

    "564": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular diseases often coexist. The mechanistic links between these two diseases are complex, multifactorial and not entirely understood, but they can influence the therapeutic approach. Therapy can be primarily directed towards treating the respiratory symptoms and reducing lung inflammation. Smoking cessation, bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids are central to this therapeutic approach. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that are responsible for the increased cardiovascular risk in COPD remain unclear, but might include arterial stiffness, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction as a consequence of systemic exposure to chemicals in cigarette smoke or airborne pollution. Therefore, it is plausible that treatment of cardiovascular co-morbidities might reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD and, consequently, therapy of COPD should be shifted to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and systemic inflammation. In support of this approach, early data suggest that patients with COPD treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers, statins, anti-platelet drugs or \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers may have improved survival and reduced hospitalisation from acute exacerbations of COPD. In this review, the potential impact of traditional therapies for COPD that are centred on treating the lungs and newer strategies potentially able to affect and mitigate cardiovascular risks in patients with COPD are discussed.", 
    "565": "Angioedema is a well-known side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). However, ACE inhibitors induced angioedema after cervical surgery is a rare condition. They result in increased levels of circulating bradykinins. Rare cases of angioedema following local trauma in patients using ACE inhibitors have been published. We present such a case. A 54-year-old Caucasian female with a history significant for hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, was admitted for routine cervical spine surgery. She has severe degenerative cervical disc disease and was admitted to the hospital for an elective cervical diskectomy. The patient failed weaning off the ventilator on multiple attempts postoperatively. There were no observed symptoms of an allergic reaction. A CT scan of the neck showed extensive soft tissue edema at the level of the arytenoids. Dexamethasone was given to reduce the edema without successful resolution. On review of her medications, it was found that the patient was resumed on lisinopril following the procedure. It was subsequently discontinued. By the following day the patient had a positive leak around the ET tube cuff and patient was successfully extubated.", 
    "566": "We have investigated the mechanisms involved in the genesis of edema and nociception induced by Philodryas patagoniensis venom (PpV) injected into the footpad of mice. PpV induced dose-related edema and nociceptive effects. Pretreatment of mice with cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin), but not with cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor (celecoxib) markedly inhibited both effects. Pretreatments with H1 receptor antagonist (promethazine) or with dual histamine-serotonin inhibitor (cyproheptadine) failed in inhibiting both effects. In groups pretreated with captopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) the edema was unaltered, but nociception was clearly increased, suggesting the participation of kinins in the pathophysiology of the nociception but not of the edema-forming effect of PpV. When PpV was treated with EDTA, the nociception was similar to the one induced by untreated venom, but edema was markedly reduced. We concluded that PpV-induced edema and nociception have cyclooxygenase eicosanoids as the main mediators and no participation of vasoactive amines. Kinins seem to participate in nociception but not in edema induced by PpV. The results also suggest that metalloproteinases are the main compounds responsible for the edema, but not for the nociception induced by this venom.",

There is a controversy about lower BP target in patients with coronary artery disease with some studies showing a J-curve relationship but a recent randomized trial (SPRINT) showing a benefit, albeit with controversy as to how BP was measured in the trial. Nevertheless, lower BP targets come with a price of needing more medication (thus impacting cost and compliance) and increases in medication-related adverse effects. There is a growing recognition that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium antagonists or thiazide diuretics can be used a first-line therapy for hypertension. Evidence also supports the use of combination drug therapy as opposed to monotherapy for more synergistic effect on lowering of BP, offsetting side effects and for improved adherence to a drug regimen.",

Here we show that inhibitors of mosquito peptidyl dipeptidase, a peptidase related to mammalian angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), are insecticidal to larvae of the mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae. ACE inhibitors (captopril, fosinopril and fosinoprilat) and two peptides (trypsin-modulating oostatic factor/TMOF and a bradykinin-potentiating peptide, BPP-12b) were all inhibitors of the larval ACE activity of both mosquitoes. Two inhibitors, captopril and fosinopril (a pro-drug ester of fosinoprilat), were tested for larvicidal activity. Within 24\u2009h captopril had killed >90% of the early instars of both species with 3(rd) instars showing greater resistance. Mortality was also high within 24\u2009h of exposure of 1(st), 2(nd) and 3(rd) instars of An. gambiae to fosinopril. Fosinopril was also toxic to Ae. aegypti larvae, although the 1(st) instars appeared to be less susceptible to this pro-drug even after 72\u2009h exposure. Homology models of the larval An. gambiae ACE proteins (AnoACE2 and AnoACE3) reveal structural differences compared to human ACE, suggesting that structure-based drug design offers a fruitful approach to the development of selective inhibitors of mosquito ACE enzymes as novel larvicides.",

More recently, the NO oxidation products nitrite and nitrate have been acknowledged as sources of NO after recycling back to NO. Activation of the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway is an alternate pathway that may generate NO from both anions and exert antihypertensive effects. Expert opinion: In this review, we provide an overview of the possible mechanisms by which these drugs enhance NO bioavailability and help in the therapy of hypertension.", 
    "604": "Cardiopathies and osteoporosis are inter-related due to pathogenetic, hormonal, genetic features as well as an increased risk of fragility. An important feature is attributed to the process of atherosclerosis, which is responsible for an osteopenia effect and degeneration of vascular walls. To date the study populations have been limited. To verify the incidence of cardio-vascular disease in a larger osteoporotic population, we designed a retrospective clinical study analyzing the \u0093Hospital Discharge Data\u0094 (HDD) in Apulia between 2006 and 2010. All patients over 55 years with a hospitalization for a fragility fracture and/or drugs prescription for osteoporosis were crossed with the diagnosis and/or drugs prescription for cardiovascular disease. We observed that between 2006 and 2010, in Apulia, 177,639 patients were hospitalized and diagnosed as having fragility fractures, 66.3% had a diagnosis of cardiopathy, with a higher prevalence in males and in patients over 80 years. The incidence of fractures were as follows: femur (51.9%), spine (20.2%), humerus (10.6%), forearm (9%), tibial pilon (7.2%) and tarsus and metatarsus (1.1%). Cerebrovascular diseases were the most frequent, followed by arrhythmias, heart failure and cardiomyopathies. In these patients, the most prescribed drugs were anti-coagulants, ACE inhibitors and diuretics. In patients affected by cerebral circulation disorder there is a greater propensity to fall and thus have a fragility fracture, particularly of the femur. The vertebral fracture, misdiagnosed in 60-70% of patients, may compromise the cardio-respiratory function of these patients. We verified a higher incidence of fragility fractures in patients who were prescribed certain categories of drugs for the treatment of cardio-vascular disease. This hypothesis is not supported by the literature, where contradictory results on the potential effects of these drugs on bone have been published. The high incidence of heart disease found in patients with fragility fractures supports the need for specific screening for osteoporosis in the population with cardio-circulatory pathology.", 
    "605": "Hypertension is an important factor in cardiovascular diseases. Angiotensin-I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors like synthetic drugs are widely used to control hypertension. ACE-inhibitory peptides from food origins could be a good alternative to synthetic drugs. A number of plant-based peptides have been investigated for their potential ACE inhibitor activities by using in vitro and in vivo assays. These plant-based peptides can be obtained by solvent extraction, enzymatic hydrolysis with or without novel food processing methods, and fermentation. ACE-inhibitory activities of peptides can be affected by their structural characteristics such as chain length, composition and sequence. ACE-inhibitory peptides should have gastrointestinal stability and reach the cardiovascular system to show their bioactivity. This paper reviews the current literature on plant-derived ACE-inhibitory peptides including their sources, production and structure, as well as their activity by in vitro and in vivo studies and their bioavailability.", 
    "606": "We performed a nested case-control study in a cohort of antihypertensive drug users to assess the association between discontinuation of different antihypertensive agents and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Cases and controls were drawn from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetics database. Patients who were hospitalised for their first AMI were considered cases and controls were not hospitalised for AMI. Antihypertensive users were defined as current users if the index date (date of AMI) fell within the prescribed duration or as discontinuers if this date fell outside the prescribed duration. According to the recency of discontinuation, discontinuers were divided into the following: recent discontinuers (\u2a7d90 days), intermediate-term discontinuers (91-180 days) and long-term discontinuers (>180 days). We found that the risk of AMI was significantly increased in discontinuers, regardless of time since discontinuation, of beta-blockers (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI; 1.25-1.91), P-value<0.0005), calcium channel blockers (CCBs; adjusted OR 2.25; 95% CI (1.53-3.30), P-value<0.0005) and diuretics (adjusted OR 1.76; 95% CI (1.24-2.48), P-value=0.002) compared to current users of these drugs. Moreover, the risk of AMI was significantly increased in long-term discontinuers (beta-blockers, CCBs, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and diuretics) and intermediate-term discontinuers (beta-blockers and CCBs) versus current users of these drugs. There was no difference in AMI risk between recent discontinuers of antihypertensive drugs versus current users of these drugs. In conclusion, discontinuation of antihypertensive drugs increases the risk of AMI after >90 days of discontinuation. This further underlines the importance of persistence to antihypertensive drug therapy to reduce the risk of AMI in patients with hypertension.",

Hypertension is a significant predictor of ADPKD progression, and a risk factor for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the most common cause for mortality among ADPKD patients. Angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors (ACE-I) are widely used as first-line treatment in ADPKD for the management of hypertension. However, their cost-effectiveness relative to other hypertensive medications, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB), has never been assessed.",

Median total healthcare costs per CKD stage or transplant were extracted from the published literature. The time horizon was set to 30 years, with 1-year duration to cycle shift. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACE-I vs ARB per additional year of prevented transplant and/or death. A one-way probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted, with 10% variation in probabilities and cost.",

    "612": "Antihypertensives are widely prescribed and could influence kidney stone risk by altering urinary calcium excretion. However, the impact of different classes of antihypertensives on kidney stone risk is unknown. To assess this impact, we conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study using linked health administrative databases. Individuals aged >65 years who initiated one of the four antihypertensive classes (that is, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers or thiazide diuretics) were included. The participants were followed for the occurrence of a kidney stone event while maintaining continuous usage on their drug class. The association between antihypertensive class and outcome was estimated by Cox regression. Of the 542\u2009581 people included, we observed 4533 kidney stone events (0.83%) over a median follow-up of 368 days (365-729). Compared with beta-blockers, thiazides were associated with a lower risk of kidney stones (hazard ratio (HR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68-0.84), ACEis/ARBs with a borderline decreased risk (HR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83-0.98) and calcium channel blockers with a comparable risk (HR 1.02; 95% CI 0.92-1.13). When the risk of requiring an intervention for a kidney stone was examined, the results were consistent with the primary analysis; however, the protective effect of ACEis/ARBs was eliminated (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.87-1.06). In conclusion, relative to beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics were associated with a decreased risk of kidney stone formation in adults aged >65 years, whereas ACEis/ARBs and calcium channel blockers had a comparable risk of presenting with a kidney stone.Hypertension Research advance online publication, 23 March 2017; doi:10.1038/hr.2017.42.",

    "616": "Patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) often have multiple comorbid conditions that may interact with each other, confound the choice of treatments, and reduce mortality. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most important comorbidities of CVD, which causes serious consequences in patients with ischemic heart disease, stroke, arrhythmia, and heart failure. COPD shares common risk factors such as tobacco smoking and aging with CVD, is associated with less physical activity, and produces systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. Overall, patients with COPD have a 2-3-fold increased risk of CVD as compared to age-matched controls when adjusted for tobacco smoking. Chronic heart failure (HF) is a frequent and important comorbidity which has a significant impact on prognosis in COPD, and vice versa. HF overlaps in symptoms and signs and has a common comorbidity with COPD, so that diagnosis of COPD is difficult in patients with HF. The combination of HF and COPD presents many therapeutic challenges including beta-blockers (BBs) and beta-agonists. Inhaled long-acting bronchodilators including beta2-agonists and anticholinergics for COPD would not worsen HF. Diuretics are relatively safe, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred to treat HF accompanied with COPD. BBs are only relatively contraindicated in asthma, but not in COPD. Low doses of cardioselective BBs should be aggressively initiated in clinically stable patients with HF accompanied with COPD combined with close monitoring for signs of airway obstruction and gradually up-titrated to the maximum tolerated dose. Encouraging appropriate and aggressive treatment for both HF and COPD should be recommended to improve quality of life and mortality in HF patients with COPD.",

Different ACE-inhibitory effects are closely related with different peptide sequences and molecular weights. Sequences of ACE-inhibitory peptides are composed of hydrophobic (proline) and aliphatic amino acids (isoleucine and leucine) at the N-terminus. As result of this review, we assume that low molecular weight peptides have a greater ACE inhibition because lower molecular weight peptides have a higher absorbency in the body. Therefore, the ACE-inhibitory effect is closely related with the degree of enzymatic hydrolysis and the composition of the peptide sequence.",

    "645": "Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Leu-Lys-Pro (LKP) are food-derived antihypertensive peptides which inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and may have potential to attenuate hypertension. There is debate over their mechanism of uptake across small intestinal epithelia, but paracellular and PepT1 carrier-mediated uptake are thought to be important routes. The aim of this study was to determine their routes of intestinal permeability using in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo intestinal models. The presence of an apical side pH of 6.5 (mimicking the intestinal acidic microclimate) and of Gly-Sar (a high affinity competitive inhibitor and substrate for PepT1) were tested on the transepithelial apical to basolateral (A to B) transport of [(3)H]-IPP and [(3)H]-LKP across filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers in vitro and rat jejunal mucosae ex vivo. A buffer pH of 6.5 on the apical side enabled Gly-Sar to reduce the apparent permeability (Papp) of [(3)H]-IPP and [(3)H]-LKP, but this inhibition was not evident at an apical buffer pH of 7.4. Gly-Sar reduced the Papp across isolated jejunal mucosae and the area under the curve (AUC) in intra-jejunal instillations when the apical/luminal buffer pH was either 7.4 or 6.5. However, the jejunal surface acidic pH was maintained in rat jejunal tissue even when the apical side buffer pH was 7.4 due to the presence of the microclimate which is not present in monolayers. PepT1 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence on monolayers and brush border of rat jejunal tissue. This data suggest that IPP and LKP are highly permeable and cross small intestinal epithelia in part by the PepT1 transporter, with an additional contribution from the paracellular route.",

To our knowledge, SAFE-HEaRt is the first clinical trial that prospectively tests the hypothesis that HER2 targeted therapies may be safely administered in patients with mildly reduced cardiac function in the setting of ongoing cardiac treatment and monitoring. The results of this study will provide cardiac safety data and inform consideration of clinical practice changes in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer and reduced cardiac function, as well as provide information regarding cardiovascular monitoring and treatment in this population.",

His medications included ramipril 5\u2005mg once daily and atorvastatin 20\u2005mg at night time. He was a non-smoker and did not consume alcohol. He reported no known drug allergies. Physical examination confirmed bilateral swollen thighs, with no overlying skin changes, clinically suggestive of compartment syndrome. His creatine kinase was >50\u2005000\u2005IU with normal renal and liver function tests. Further investigation with MRI-identified prominent swelling of the vastus intermedius and medialis muscles, more marked on the left, with extensive diffuse short tau inversion recovery (STIR) signal hyperintensity and isointensity on T1 sequences, suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. He underwent bilateral fasciotomies of his thighs and aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation with close monitoring of his electrolytes. Intraoperatively his muscle was healthy, with no evidence of haematoma or necrosis. His medication atorvastatin was stopped due to his rhabdomyolysis. 48\u2005hours later, he returned to theatre and review of his fasciotomy wounds was unremarkable. 4\u2005days later, he was discharged uneventfully. His postoperative recovery was complicated by a serous discharge from his left medial thigh wound.

Comorbidities, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes were compared for patients with acute myocardial infarction with and without COPD between 2004 and 2013. Temporal trends in treatment and outcomes were analyzed. We included 6770 patients admitted to hospitals with acute myocardial infarction diagnoses, of whom 1921 (28.3%) had COPD. Fewer patients with COPD received \u03b2-blockers (adjusted odds ratio 0.66, 95% CI 0.59-0.74), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (adjusted odds ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.93), statins, anticoagulants, dual antiplatelets, and coronary interventions.

    "656": "The transport behavior and absorption mechanism of Ala-His-Leu-Leu (AHLL) intestinal absorption in Caco-2 cell monolayers were clarified systemically. The safe absorptive concentration of AHLL was 200\u2009\u03bcg/mL, which was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. The permeation of AHLL was concentration dependent in a bidirectional transfer and reached a plateau at 90\u2009min. The efflux ratio was above 0.5, suggesting that AHLL was absorbed by both active transport and passive diffusion. The apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of AHLL both from the apical (AP) to basolateral (BL) side (PappAB) and from the BL to AP side (PappBA) decreased when the temperature was lowered from 37\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C.The uptake of AHLL was more at pH 7.4 than at other pHs. Both verapamil and (E)-3-[[[3-[2-(7-chloro-2- quinolinyl) ethenyl] phenyl]-[[(3-dimethyl amino)-3-oxopropyl]thio] methyl] thio]-propanoic acid (MK571) inhibited the absorption of AHLL, indicating that P-glycoprotein and multi-drug resistant proteins (MRPs) were all involved in AHLL secretion, especially multi-drug resistant protein 2 (MRP2). AHLL was transported through both trans- and paracellular pathways across the Caco-2 cell monolayer.

Therefore, to investigate the potential renal benefits of improved metabolic control in this model, we studied the effect of treatment with the dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1/\u03b3 agonist AZD6610 and compared it with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. AZD6610 lowered plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations and increased liver size, but had no significant effect in reducing albuminuria, whereas enalapril did have an effect. Nephrin and WT1 mRNA expression decreased in the kidneys of BTBRob/ob mice, consistent with podocyte injury and loss, but was unaffected by either drug treatment: at the protein level, both nephrin and WT1-positive cells per glomerulus were decreased. Mesangial matrix expansion was reduced in AZD6610-treated mice. GFR, measured by creatinine clearance, was increased in BTBRob/ob mice, but unaffected by either treatment. Unexpectedly, enalapril-treated mice showed intrarenal arteriolar vascular remodeling with concentric thickening of vessel walls. In summary, we found that the BTBRob/ob mouse model shows some similarities to the early changes seen in human DN, but that ACE inhibition or PPAR\u03b1/\u03b3 agonism afforded limited or no kidney protection.",

The degree of hydrolysis determined by the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic-acid method was 17.1\u00b10.7% after 180min of digestion. The concentration of small peptides increased with hydrolysis time, and analysis by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP HPLC) and mass spectrometry, revealed a virtually unchanged peptide profile. These results suggested that those proteases were highly specific, as only certain peptide bonds were cleaved. The hydrolysate of 180min displayed the highest inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) showing an IC50 of 1.72\u00b10.25mg/mL, and the analysis of the peptide fractionation in this hydrolysate by RP HPLC exhibited two peaks responsible for that activity. Fragmentation analysis through the use of iterated matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS/MS) with the aid of bioinformatics tools enabled us to deduce two peptide sequences-one, YQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV, having been previously reported as an ACE-inhibitor; the other, RFFVAPFPE, as yet undescribed. The presence of bioactive peptides in these casein hydrolysates argues for their potential use in the development of functional foods.",

We undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of preoperative hypertension and preoperative antihypertensive medication to postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to March 2016) for eligible studies. The outcomes were the effects of preoperative hypertension, preoperative calcium antagonists regimen, preoperative ACE inhibitors regimen, and preoperative beta blocking agents regimen with POAF. We calculated pooled risk ratios (OR) and 95% CIs using random- or fixed-effects models. Results. Twenty-five trials involving 130087 patients were listed. Meta-analysis showed that the number of preoperative hypertension patients in POAF group was significantly higher (P < 0.05), while we found that there are no significant differences between two groups in Asia patients by subgroup analysis, which is in contrast to other outcomes. Compared with the Non-POAF group, the number of patients who used calcium antagonists and ACE inhibitors preoperatively in POAF group was significantly higher (P < 0.05).

As an inhibitor of neprilysin, an enzyme that degrades biologically active natriuretic peptides, this first-in-class therapy increases levels of circulating natriuretic peptides, resulting in natriuretic, diuretic, and vasodilatory effects. In patients with chronic New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the PARADIGM-HF trial demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced the primary endpoint of cardiovascular mortality and heart failure hospitalization, compared with enalapril. The rate of all-cause mortality was also significantly reduced. Subsequently, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America recently updated guideline recommendations for Stage C patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction to recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or sacubitril/valsartan in conjunction with other evidence-based therapies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Several analyses have suggested the cost-effectiveness of this new therapy. To ensure tolerability, initiating the lower dosage form of sacubitril/valsartan is warranted in patients with severe renal impairment, moderate hepatic impairment, and low blood pressure, and close monitoring is warranted in such patients. A 36-hour washout period is recommended when switching patients from an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to sacubitril/valsartan.

Our group and other have been shown that angiotensin II (Ang II) and its receptor AT1 (AT1R), a key effector axis of renin-angiotensin system (RAS), have immune regulatory effects on T cells. Previously, we showed that inhibition of AT1R signaling protects mice against the lethal disease induced by Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection However, most of the Ang II/AT1R actions were characterized by using only pharmacological approaches, the effects of which may not always be due to a specific receptor blockade. In addition, the mechanisms of action of the AT1R in inducing the pathogenic activity of Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T cells during blood-stage were not determined. Here, we examined how angiotensin II/AT1R axis promotes the harmful response of Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T-cell during blood-stage by using genetic and pharmacological approaches. We evaluated the response of wild-type (WT) and AT1R(-/-)Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T cells in mice infected with a transgenic PbA lineage expressing ovalbumin; and in parallel infected mice receiving WT Plasmodium-specific CD8(+) T cells were treated with losartan (AT1R antagonist) or captopril (ACE inhibitor). Both, AT1R(-/-) OT-I cells and WT OT-I cells from losartan- or captopril-treated mice showed lower expansion, reduced IL-2 production and IL-2R\u03b1 expression, lower activation (lower expression of CD69, CD44 and CD160) and lower exhaustion profiles. AT1R(-/-) OT-I cells also exhibit lower expression of the integrin LFA-1 and the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3, known to play a key role in the development of cerebral malaria. Moreover, AT1R(-/-) OT-I cells produce lower amounts of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and show lower degranulation upon restimulation.

    "736": "Combinations between an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) are among the recommended treatments for hypertensive patients uncontrolled by monotherapy. Four randomized, double-blind, parallel group studies with a similar design, including 1469 hypertensive patients uncontrolled by a previous monotherapy and with \u22651 cardiovascular risk factor, compared the efficacy of a combination of a sulfhydryl ACE inhibitor (zofenopril at 30 or 60\u00a0mg) or an ARB (irbesartan at 150 or 300\u00a0mg) plus HCTZ 12.5\u00a0mg. The extent of blood pressure (BP)-lowering was assessed in the office and over 24\u00a0h. Pleiotropic features of the treatments were evaluated by studying their effect on systemic inflammation, organ damage, arterial stiffness, and metabolic biochemical parameters. Both treatments similarly reduced office and ambulatory BPs after 18-24\u00a0weeks. In the ZODIAC study a larger reduction in high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was observed under zofenopril (-0.52 vs. +0.97\u00a0mg/dL under irbesartan, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), suggesting a potential protective effect against the development of atherosclerosis. In the ZENITH study the rate of carotid plaque regression was significantly larger under zofenopril (32% vs. 16%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). In the diabetic patients of the ZAMES study, no adverse effects of treatments on blood glucose and lipids as well as an improvement of renal function were observed. In patients with isolated systolic hypertension of the ZEUS study, a slight and similar improvement in renal function and small reductions in pulse wave velocity (PWV), augmentation index (AI), and central systolic BP were documented with both treatments. Thus, the fixed combination of zofenopril and HCTZ may have a relevant place in the treatment of high-risk or monotherapy-treated uncontrolled hypertensive patients requiring a more prompt, intensive, and sustained BP reduction, in line with the recommendations of current guidelines.",

The present study was designed to explore the impact of inhibiting Renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) and inflammatory pathways in stress pathophysiology. In the present study, male LACA mice were subjected to restraint stress daily for 30 days. Losartan, nimesulide, ramipril, minocycline and their combinations were administered 45min prior to restraint stress daily and their effects were observed. Restraint stressed mice depicted depression like behavior along with increased oxidative stress markers in their brains. CRS induced insulin resistance depicted by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypercholesteremia, increased glycosylated hemoglobin and HOMA-IR. Besides, treatment with losartan, nimesulide, ramipril and minocycline significantly restored the behavioural and biochemical alterations and improved insulin sensitivity in stressed mice. Combination treatments synergistically reversed depression like behavior and decreased plasma glucose levels. Moreover they restored insulin levels, glycosylated hemoglobin levels and HOMA-IR values to the normal. This study signifies the synergistic effect of simultaneously blocking RAS and inflammatory pathways in stress pathophysiology.", 
    "738": "There are limited contemporary data on guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) utilization and long-term clinical outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) with and without concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD). From 2006 to 2013, 879 patients with claudication or critical limb ischemia (CLI) underwent diagnostic angiography or therapeutic endovascular intervention at our multidisciplinary vascular center. GDMT use was assessed at the time of angiography, and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and all-cause mortality were determined during 5\u00a0years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to adjust for baseline differences between patients with and without concomitant CAD. Despite a higher adherence to GDMT (all p \u22640.002) for the use of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and statins, patients with PAD and concomitant CAD had higher unadjusted 5-year rates of MACCE (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and all-cause mortality (HR 1.86, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.4, p\u00a0= 0.0001). After adjustment for baseline co-morbidities, the presence of CAD remained an independent risk factor for mortality (adjusted HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.80, p\u00a0= 0.04) but not for MACCE (adjusted HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.60, p\u00a0= 0.10) in patients with PAD. A sensitivity analysis limited to patients with CLI demonstrated that concomitant CAD was associated with significantly higher adjusted rates of both MACCE (adjusted HR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.03, p\u00a0= 0.01) and mortality (adjusted HR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.20, p\u00a0= 0.006). In conclusion, despite higher rates of GDMT use, PAD patients with concomitant CAD had significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality during a 5-year postprocedural follow-up. The subgroup of CLI patients with concomitant CAD was at particularly high risk for both MACCE and all-cause mortality.", 
    "739": "There is a close relationship between arterial stiffness and blood pressure. The studies suggest that the advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and its cell receptor (RAGE) are involved in the arterial stiffness in two ways: changes in arterial structure and vascular function. Plasma levels of AGEs and expression of RAGE are elevated, while the levels of soluble RAGE (sRAGE) and endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE) are lowered in patients with hypertension (HTN). There is a positive correlation between plasma levels of AGEs and arterial stiffness, and an inverse association between arterial stiffness/HTN, and serum levels of sRAGE and esRAGE. Various measures can reduce the levels of AGEs and expression of RAGE, and elevate sRAGE. Arterial stiffness and blood pressure could be reduced by lowering the serum levels of AGEs, and increasing the levels of sRAGE. Levels of AGEs can be lowered by reducing the consumption of AGE-rich diet, short duration of cooking in moist heat at low temperature, and cessation of cigarette smoking. Drugs such as aminoguanidine, vitamins, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor blockers, statins, and metformin inhibit AGE formation. Alagebrium, an AGE breakers reduces levels of AGEs. Clinical trials with some drugs tend to reduce stiffness. Systemic administration of sRAGE has beneficial effect in animal studies. In conclusion, AGE-RAGE axis is involved in arterial stiffness and HTN. The studies suggest that inhibition of AGEs formation, reduction of AGE consumption, blockade of AGE-RAGE interaction, suppression of RAGE expression, and exogenous administration of sRAGE may be novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of arterial stiffness and HTN.",

The pathophysiology of sarcopenia is incompletely understood but appears to involve multiple pathways, including inflammation, hormonal dysregulation, impaired regeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction and denervation. There are several ways in which we might select potential pharmacological interventions for testing in clinical trials. These include a 'bottom-up' approach using basic science to elucidate the molecular processes involved and identify potential targets from this knowledge-a strategy that has led to the development of myostatin inhibitors. A 'top-down' approach might use observational data to examine the association between physical function and use of certain medications, such as the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with slower decline in physical function. Once a pharmacological intervention has been proposed, efficacy must be demonstrated in this complex multi-morbid population. Both muscle mass and muscle function need to be measured as outcomes, but these outcomes require large sample sizes and sufficient follow-up to detect change. Biomarkers that can predict the response of sarcopenia to intervention after a short time would greatly assist our ability to select candidate interventions in short proof-of-concept trials.

The combination treatment with telmisartan and pitavastatin displayed a more effective decrease in albuminuria and proteinuria, even to the normal level. Enhanced nephroprotection was also observed in this combination group, which was independent of the cholesterol-lowering effects.

    "756": "We hypothesized that the testis-specific isoform of angiotensin-converting enzyme (tACE) is released during bovine sperm capacitation, and its peptidase activity is required for capacitation. Specific objectives of this study were to (i) develop an anti-tACE antibody; (ii) characterize expression of tACE in bovine testes and sperm; and (iii) determine the role of tACE in capacitation. A 110-kDa protein, consistent with the mass of tACE, was detected in sperm extract by our anti-tACE immunoserum. This immunotarget localized at the acrosomal region and principal piece, but was only expressed in testis of mature bulls. When bull sperm were incubated in Sp-TALP (0 and 4\u2009hr) plus 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml heparin (capacitation group) or 10\u2009\u00b5g/ml heparin\u2009+\u200910\u2009\u00b5M captopril (an ACE inhibitor) for 4\u2009hr, the number of acrosome-reacted (40.1 vs. 24.0%, respectively) and hyperactivated (15.0 vs. 9.7%) sperm increased, and tyrosine phosphoprotein content were higher (p\u2009<\u20090.05) for sperm in heparin alone. tACE activity was also higher (0.04\u2009U/ml; p\u2009<\u20090.01) in incubation medium of sperm exposed to heparin compared to 0- and 4-hr incubation controls or heparin\u2009+\u2009captopril conditions (0, 0.005, and 0.009\u2009U/ml, respectively). Furthermore, capacitation-associated shedding of a portion of tACE into the medium decreased sperm content of the 110-kDa tACE, but concurrently increased the abundance of a 60-kDa tACE variant. Thus, a portion of the extracellular region of tACE (containing its catalytic site) is released from bovine sperm during capacitation, and tACE activity may be required for sperm capacitation.",

However, there is a dearth of experimental studies to validate these claims. We endeavoured to evaluate the inhibitory effects of crude aqueous extract as traditionally used together with the crude methanol extracts of AT leaves on urease, angiotensin (I) converting enzyme (ACE), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), cholesterol esterase (CEase), glycogen phosphorylase a (GPa), and glycation in vitro. The crude extract showing potent activity against the studied enzymes was further partitioned using different solvents of increasing polarity. The enzyme inhibitory and antiglycation activities of each fraction was assessed. Kinetic of inhibition of the active crude extract/fractions on the aforementioned enzymes was consequently determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots. An ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-UV/MS) system was used to establish the phytochemical profile of AT. The real time cell analysis system (iCELLigence\u2122) was used to monitor any cellular cytotoxicity of AT. Crude methanolextract (CME) was a potent inhibitor of the studied enzymes, with IC50 ranging from 696.22 to 19.73\u03bcg/mL. CME (82.5%) significantly (p<0.05) inhibited glycation and was comparable to aminoguanidine (81.5%). Ethyl acetate and n-butanol fractions of CME showed non-competitive, competitive, and uncompetitive mode of inhibition against ACE, CEase, and AChE respectively. Mangiferin, a xanthone glucoside was present in CME, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol fractions.

However, new treatment strategies aimed at mitigating the rise of the heart failure pandemic are warranted because clinical trials show that RAS blockers have limited benefits in halting disease progression. The main goal of this review is to put forward the concept of an intracrine RAS signaling through the novel angiotensin-(1-12)/chymase axis as the main source of deleterious angiotensin II (Ang II) in cardiac maladaptive remodeling leading to heart failure (HF).", 
    "767": "Expanding traditional knowledge, Ang II can be produced in tissues independently from the circulatory renin-angiotensin system. In the heart, angiotensin-(1-12) [Ang-(1-12)], a recently discovered derivative of angiotensinogen, is a precursor of Ang II, and chymase rather than ACE is the main enzyme contributing to the direct production of Ang II from Ang-(1-12). The Ang-(1-12)/chymase axis is an independent intracrine pathway accounting for the trophic, contractile, and pro-arrhythmic Ang II actions in the human heart. Ang-(1-12) expression and chymase activity have been found elevated in the left atrial appendage of heart disease subjects, suggesting a pivotal role of this axis in the progression of HF. Recent meta-analysis of large clinical trials on the use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in cardiovascular disease has demonstrated an imbalance between patients that significantly benefit from these therapeutic agents and those that remain at risk for heart disease progression. Looking to find an explanation, detailed investigation on the RAS has unveiled a previously unrecognized complexity of substrates and enzymes in tissues ultimately associated with the production of Ang II that may explain the shortcomings of ACE inhibition and angiotensin receptor blockade. Discovery of the Ang-(1-12)/chymase axis in human hearts, capable of producing Ang II independently from the circulatory RAS, has led to the notion that a tissue-delimited RAS signaling in an intracrine fashion may account for the deleterious effects of Ang II in the heart, contributing to the transition from maladaptive cardiac remodeling to heart failure. Targeting intracellular RAS signaling may improve current therapies aimed at reducing the burden of heart failure.",

In this study we tested the hypothesis that captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, inhibits or attenuates radiation-induced endothelial TGF-\u03b21 secretion. The human endothelial hybrid cell line EA.HY926 was irradiated with split doses of x-rays (28 Gy delivered in 14 fractions of 2 Gy). TGF-\u03b21 mRNA, TNF-\u03b1 mRNA and TGF-\u03b21 protein levels were evaluated by RT-PCR and western blotting each month until the fifth month post radiation. Ang II was detected using radioimmunoassays, NF-\u03baB activity was examined using EMSA, and western blotting was used to detect the expression of I\u03ba-B\u03b1. To explore the role of Ang II on radiation-induced TGF-\u03b21 release and I\u03ba-B\u03b1 expression, captopril was added to cultured cells before, during, or after irradiation. Sustained strong expression of TGF-\u03b21 was observed after conventional fractionated irradiation. TNF-\u03b1, Ang II, and NF-\u03baB activity were also increased in EA.Hy926 cells after radiation. Captopril decreased Ang II expression, inhibited the NF-\u03baB pathway and reduced TGF-\u03b21 expression.

Angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors are widely known to cause angioedema but less is known about the association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (gliptins) and angioedema. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are anti-diabetic drugs used to improve glycaemic control. They, as a class effect, inadvertently affect the degradation of the vasoactive kinins bradykinin and substance P, both of which can cause angioedema due to vasodilatation and increase in vascular permeability in the capillaries. Objective To assess the risk and pathomechanism of angioedema due to inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors when used as monotherapy and in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors. Method PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PubMed Central, Web of Science, Google Scholar and clinicaltrials.gov were searched using different combinations of keywords \"angioedema\", \"dipeptidyl peptidase 4\", \"dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors\", \"gliptins\", \"bradykinin\", \"substance P\" and \"angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors\". Original research papers were preferably used as references and their bibliographies were used to further the search for original research results. Results Both angiotensin converting enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 are major enzymes in the degradation pathway of bradykinin and substance P, and when inhibited pharmacologically - especially at the same time - the theoretical risk of angioedema is increased due to accumulation of vasoactive kinins. Conclusion Treatment with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors must be carefully considered and monitored especially during concurrent treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors or when treating patients with a known predisposition to angioedema.",

Methods We identified all patients admitted to any Swedish coronary care unit for a first ACS between 2005 and 2010 ( n\u2009=\u200977,432). In 75,129 patients, creatinine levels were available in order to obtain the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by tail-cuff method once a week. The behaviour of rats was investigated during 23-hours in the phenotyper after four weeks of the treatment. Chronic administration of L-NAME induced hypertension without a change in HR. All tested substances partly prevented the increase of SBP, while ivabradine and melatonin also reduced HR. Ivabradine, captopril and melatonin reduced daily food intake, slightly decreased daily water intake and attenuated body weight gain. In L-NAME group, locomotor activity was enhanced by ivabradine, whereas exploratory behaviour was increased by melatonin and captopril. In conclusion, ivabradine, besides its potentially protective hemodynamic actions, does not seem to exert any disturbing effects on behaviour in L-NAME-induced hypertension in rats, while some of its effects were similar to captopril or melatonin. It is suggested that ivabradine used in cardiovascular indications is harmless regarding the effect on behaviour.",

STNx was not associated with changes in plasma levels of ACE, ACE2 or angiotensin peptides. Ramipril reduced blood pressure, improved cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and inhibited cardiac ACE. Ang 1-7 infusion increased blood pressure, cardiac interstitial fibrosis and cardiac ACE binding compared to untreated STNx rats. Although in STNx rats, the addition of ACEi to Ang 1-7 prevented any deleterious cardiac effects of Ang 1-7, a limitation of the study is that the large increase in plasma Ang 1-7 with ramipril may have masked any effect of infused Ang 1-7.",

Angiotensin II is a potent vaso-active peptide that causes arterioles to constrict, resulting in increased blood pressure. A rapid and sensitive method for the identification of inhibitors of ACE was developed, and optimized employing HPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS. In this assay, angiotensin I substrate was converted into the product angiotensin II with the catalytic action of ACE. A calibration curve for depleting concentration of angiotensin I was developed and linearity of R(2)=0.999 with a remarkably low concentration of substrate range 20-200nM. The limit of detection and quantification of angiotensin I was found to be 1.93 and 5.84nM, respectively.

    "875": "Endothelial dysfunction plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) has been recognized as an independent risk factor of endothelial dysfunction and the biomarker of atherosclerosis. This study was to investigate whether endogenous ADMA and its metabolic enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) were involved in mechanisms of captopril protection against endothelial dysfunction in high fat diet feeding rabbits. Half of model rabbits were treated with captopril (10mg/kg/d, i.g.) for 12w. Vascular morphology and serum lipid profiles were detected. Serum ADMA concentration were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Recombinant DDAH2 gene adenoviruses were ex vivo transferred to thoracic aortas of high fat diet feeding rabbits. Endothelium-dependent relaxation of aortas response to acetylcholine and DDAH activity were measured. Atherosclerosis was confirmed in high fat diet feeding rabbits by increased serum lipid profiles and morphologic changes of vascular wall. Serum ADMA levels were significantly increased in hyperlipidemic rabbits accompanied with impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation and inhibition of DDAH activity in thoracic aortas. Captopril treatment not only decreased vascular intima thickening and serum ADMA concentration but also preserved vascular DDAH activity and endothelium-dependent relaxation in hyperlipidemic rabbits without influence on serum lipid profiles. Similar beneficial effects on endothelial function and DDAH activity could be achieved by DDAH2 gene transfection. These results indicated that captopril could protect against injuries of vascular morphology and endothelial function in hyperlipidemic rabbits, the mechanisms may be related to the preservation of DDAH activity and decrease of ADMA accumulation in vascular endothelium.", 
    "876": "The recent advance and revision on the renin-angiotensin system in lamprey were summarized and we emphasized that presence of two types of angiotensins (Angs) in lamprey. Due to the parasitic nature on fish blood, teleost-type Angs were produced in their buccal gland and secreted into the lamphredin to evade the host immunorejection. A native lamprey angiotensinogen (AGT) was identified in genome and it retains serine-protease inhibitor activity for thrombin that regulates the blood coagulation pathway. The native lamprey angiotensin II (Lp-Ang II) is hypotensive instead of hypertensive, suggesting a functional divergence on cardiovascular regulation from the main vertebrate groups. The renin gene was absent from the lamprey genome so far, and the mutation on the renin-recognition site on lamprey AGT suggested that other proteases may have replaced the role of renin. Lp-Ang II was shown to bind to AT1 receptor and internalized, but the downstream signaling was still unknown. Molecular and phylogenetic evidence on invertebrate ACE-like proteins indicated that they were not homologous to those in vertebrates and could be acting on other native peptides. Although it was generally believed that the RAS was a well-conserved hormone system in vertebrates and invertebrates, revision by molecular data indicated that invertebrates lack homologous RAS components while lamprey possess an almost complete RAS. This suggests that the hormone cascade system was first evolved around cyclostome emergence and invertebrates could have taken up the RAS components from vertebrates through horizontal gene transfer.",

    "880": "Enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins from rice, soy, pea and wheat, with both chymotrypsin and thermolysin, resulted in hydrolysates, which are efficient inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). IC50 values of the hydrolysates were between 27 and 39mg/l, which is comparable to enzymatically hydrolysed whey protein. A significant increase of the ACE-inhibiting effect was observed following butanol extraction due to accumulation of hydrophobic peptides (IC50 between 12 and 21mg/l). Based on the identification and quantification of individual tryptophan-, tyrosine- and phenylalanine-containing dipeptides, 50-80% of the total ACE-inhibiting potential of butanol extracts from plant protein hydrolysates could be explained. Compared to hydrolysates from whey protein, where the inhibitory effect can almost exclusively be attributed to Ile-Trp, the ACE inhibition by plant protein hydrolysates is caused by a variety of peptides, in particular tyrosine-containing peptides. Hydrolysates of plant proteins are promising ingredients for the development of functional foods.",

    "885": "There is a growing interest in identifying natural food ingredients that may serve to prevent dementia such as that due to Alzheimer disease (AD). Peptides derived from food proteins have been demonstrated to have various physiological activities such as a hypotensive action. Recent findings have indicated possible associations of hypertension with AD progression, and suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with potential to pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB) may reduce the risk of AD. In this study, we investigated the effect of milk peptide (CH-3) on cognitive function in AD model mice. CH-3 contains a tripeptide (methionine-lysine-proline, MKP) that has been found to have a strong ACE inhibitory effect and the potential to pass through the BBB. Adult male ddY mice were used in this study, and an animal model of AD was induced by intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of A\u03b21-42. CH-3 (250 mg/kg/day) or MKP (0.5 mg/kg/day) was orally administered every day starting 2 days before ICV injection. At 3 weeks after ICV injection, cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze test. Brain samples were obtained after behavioral testing, and expression of inflammatory cytokines and NADPH oxidase subunits was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. ICV injection of A\u03b21-42 significantly impaired cognitive function compared with that in PBS-injected mice. Daily administration of CH-3 markedly attenuated this A\u03b21-42-induced cognitive decline. A\u03b21-42 injection significantly enhanced the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p22phox in the mouse hippocampus compared with PBS injection, and showed a tendency to increase the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), p47phox and gp91phox, whereas CH-3 treatment markedly reduced A\u03b21-42-induced TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, iNOS, p47phox and gp91phox expression. Finally, administration of MKP also attenuated A\u03b21-42-induced cognitive impairment with an increase in cerebral blood flow. The present study demonstrated that repeated oral administration of CH-3 to AD model mice not only improved cognitive function but also suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines and production of oxidative stress, and suggests its therapeutic potential for preventing cognitive impairment in AD.",

The efficacy and safety of MRAs among patients on chronic dialysis is less well studied. A growing body of evidence derived from small randomized studies suggests that MRA therapy may improve a number of surrogate cardiovascular (CV) risk factors (i.e. blood pressure, LV mass index, LV ejection fraction, carotid intima-media-thickness) in long-term dialysis patients. Two larger studies and a recent meta-analysis provided evidence that MRA therapy lowers the risk of all-cause and CV mortality by up to 60%, but significantly increases the incidence of serious hyperkalaemia. In this article, we discuss the efficacy and safety of spironolactone and eplerenone among dialysis patients, providing an overview of the currently available evidence from randomized controlled studies. We conclude with a call for larger, properly-designed studies aiming to fully elucidate the potential harms and benefits of MRAs in this high-risk population.

We linked the USRDS cohort with Medicare part D prescriptions-fill data and the DCI cohort with USRDS data. Unique aspect of USRDS cohort was pharmacy prescription-fill data and for DCI cohort was detailed clinical data, including blood pressure, weight, and ultrafiltration. We classified prescribed antihypertensives into the following mutually exclusive regimens: \u03b2-blockers, renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs-containing regimens without a \u03b2-blocker (RAS), \u03b2-blocker\u200a+\u200aRAS, and others. We used marginal structural models accounting for time-updated comorbidities to quantify each regimen's association with mortality (both cohorts) and cardiovascular hospitalization (DCI-Medicare Subcohort).In the USRDS and DCI cohorts there were 9655 (29%) and 3200 (28%) deaths, respectively. In both cohorts, RAS compared to \u03b2-blockers regimens were associated with lower risk of death; (hazard ratio [HR]) (95% confidence interval [CI]) for all-cause mortality, (0.90 [0.82-0.97] in USRDS and 0.87 [0.76-0.98] in DCI) and cardiovascular mortality (0.84 [0.75-0.95] in USRDS and 0.88 [0.71-1.07] in DCI). There was no association between antihypertensive regimens and the risk of cardiovascular hospitalizations.In hemodialysis patients undergoing routine care, renin-angiotensin system blocking drugs-containing regimens were associated with a lower risk of death compared with \u03b2-blockers-containing regimens but there was no association with cardiovascular hospitalizations.

    "900": "Inappropriate activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exacerbates renal and vascular injury. Accordingly, treatment with global RAS antagonists attenuates cardiovascular risk and slows the progression of proteinuric kidney disease. By reducing BP, RAS inhibitors limit secondary immune activation responding to hemodynamic injury in the target organ. However, RAS activation in hematopoietic cells has immunologic effects that diverge from those of RAS stimulation in the kidney and vasculature. In preclinical studies, activating type 1 angiotensin (AT1) receptors in T lymphocytes and myeloid cells blunts the polarization of these cells toward proinflammatory phenotypes, protecting the kidney from hypertensive injury and fibrosis. These endogenous functions of immune AT1 receptors temper the pathogenic actions of renal and vascular AT1 receptors during hypertension. By counteracting the effects of AT1 receptor stimulation in the target organ, exogenous administration of AT2 receptor agonists or angiotensin 1-7 analogs may similarly limit inflammatory injury to the heart and kidney. Moreover, although angiotensin II is the classic effector molecule of the RAS, several RAS enzymes affect immune homeostasis independently of canonic angiotensin II generation. Thus, as reviewed here, multiple components of the RAS signaling cascade influence inflammatory cell phenotype and function with unpredictable and context-specific effects on innate and adaptive immunity.",

The main outcome was the change in serum UA, which was defined as UA at the exit visit minus that at baseline. Secondary outcomes were as follows: 1) controlled hyperuricemia (UA concentration <357 \u03bcmol/L after treatment) and 2) new-onset hyperuricemia in participants with normal UA concentrations (<357 \u03bcmol/L).Results: After a median of 4.4 y of treatment, the mean \u00b1 SD UA concentration increased by 34.7 \u00b1 72.5 \u03bcmol/L in the enalapril-alone group and by 30.7 \u00b1 71.8 \u03bcmol/L in the enalapril-folic acid group, which resulted in a mean group difference of -4.0 \u03bcmol/L (95% CI: -6.5, -1.6 \u03bcmol/L; P = 0.001). Furthermore, compared with enalapril alone, enalapril-folic acid treatment showed an increase in controlled hyperuricemia (30.3% compared with 25.6%; OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.70) and a decrease in new-onset hyperuricemia (15.0% compared with 16.3%; OR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.99). A greater beneficial effect was observed in subjects with hyperuricemia (P-interaction = 0.07) or higher concentrations of total homocysteine (tHcy) (P-interaction = 0.02) at baseline. Furthermore, there was a significant inverse relation (P < 0.001) between the reduction of tHcy and the change in UA concentrations.Conclusions: Enalapril-folic acid therapy, compared with enalapril alone, can significantly reduce the magnitude of the increase of UA concentrations in hypertensive adults.

    "907": "Over the last decade, the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on the development of obesity and its comorbidities has been extensively addressed. Both circulating and local RAS components are up-regulated in obesity and involved in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease onset. Pharmacological manipulations of RAS are viable strategies to tackle metabolic impairments caused by the excessive body fat mass. Renin inhibitors rescue insulin resistance, but do not have marked effects on hepatic steatosis. However, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) yield beneficial hepatic remodeling. ARBs elicit body mass loss and normalize insulin levels, tackling insulin resistance. Also, this drug class increases adiponectin levels, besides countering interleukin-6, tumoral necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta 1. The latter is essential to prevent from liver fibrosis. When conjugated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha activation, ARB fully rescues fatty liver. These effects might be orchestrated by an indirect up-regulation of MAS receptor due to angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) blockade. These associations of ARB with PPAR activation and ACE2-angiotensin (ANG) (1-7)-MAS receptor axis deserve a better understanding.

    "910": "The database consisted of 72 BP-lowering RCTs (260\u200a210 patients) and 50 head-to-head drug comparison RCTs (247\u200a006). Among these two sets, RCTs or RCT subgroups separately reporting data from patients with and without diabetes mellitus were identified, and stratified by in-treatment achieved SBP and DBP, by drug class compared with placebo, and drug class compared with all other classes. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals, and absolute risk reductions of six fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes, all-cause death, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were calculated (random-effects model) separately for diabetes mellitus and no diabetes mellitus, and compared by interaction analysis.", 
    "911": "We identified 41 RCTs providing data on 61\u200a772 patients with diabetes mellitus and 40 RCTs providing data on 191\u200a353 patients without diabetes mellitus. For achieved SBP at least 140\u200ammHg, relative and absolute reductions of most cardiovascular outcomes were significantly greater in diabetes mellitus than no diabetes mellitus, whereas for achieved SBP below 130\u200ammHg, the difference disappeared or reversed (greater outcome reduction in no diabetes mellitus). Significant ESRD reduction was found only in diabetes mellitus, but it was greatest when achieved SBP was at least 140\u200ammHg, and no further effect was found at SBP below 140\u200ammHg. All antihypertensive drug classes reduced cardiovascular risk vs. placebo in diabetes mellitus and no diabetes mellitus, but angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were the only class more effective in diabetes mellitus than in no diabetes mellitus. When compared to other classes, renin-angiotensin system blockers were equally effective in cardiovascular prevention in no diabetes mellitus, but moderately, though significantly, more effective in diabetes mellitus.", 
    "912": "BP-lowering treatment significantly and importantly reduces cardiovascular risk both in diabetes mellitus and no diabetes mellitus, but evidence for reduced ESRD risk is available only in diabetes. Contrary to past recommendations, in diabetes mellitus there is little or no further benefit in lowering SBP below 130\u200ammHg, whereas continuing benefit is seen in no diabetes mellitus also at SBP below 130\u200ammHg. Although all BP-lowering drugs can beneficially be prescribed in hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus, the current recommendation to initiate or include a renin-angiotensin system blocker is supported by the evidence here presented.", 
    "913": "Small bowel angioedema induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is a rare clinicopathologic entity. It frequently poses a diagnostic challenge and is often not recognized before surgical exploration. The present study illustrates that clinical awareness for this condition and adequate use of radiologic investigations can help make the correct diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema, thus avoiding the cost and morbidity associated with unnecessary interventions.", 
    "914": "The potential protective effect of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors is a subject of increasing interest due to their possible role as chemopreventive agents against colorectal cancer (CRC). To evaluate this association, we conducted a case-control study with 2165 cases of colorectal cancer, diagnosed between 2007 and 2012, and 3912 population controls frequency matched (by age, sex and region) from the Spanish multicenter case-control study MCC-Spain. We found a significant protective effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) against CRC, limited to the under-65years group (OR=0.65 95%CI (0.48-0.89)) and to a lesser degree to men (OR=0.81 95%CI (0.66-0.99). In contrast, the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) did not show a significant effect. Regarding the duration of use, a greater protection was observed in men as the length of consumption increases. In contrast, in the under-65 stratum, the strongest association was found in short-term treatments. Finally, by analyzing ACEIs effect by colon subsite, we found no differences, except for under 65years old, where the maximum protection was seen in the proximal intestine, descending in the distal and rectum (without statistical significance). In conclusion, our study shows a protective effect on CRC of the ACEis limited to males and people under 65years old, which increases in proximal colon in the latter. If confirmed, these results may suggest a novel approach to proximal CRC prevention, given the shortcomings of colonoscopy screening in this location.", 
    "915": "Perioperative use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) in patients undergoing cardiac operations remains controversial. The current practice of discontinuing renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors preoperatively may negate their beneficial effects in vulnerable populations, including patients with metabolic syndrome, who exhibit elevated renin-angiotensin system activity. We hypothesized that preoperative ARB use is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative complications, compared with ACEi or no drug, in patients with metabolic syndrome undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "916": "We used propensity matching to derive a cohort of 1,351 patients from 2,998 who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting based on preoperative use of ARBs, ACEis, or no renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors.

    "919": "The inhibitory activity of captopril, a thiol-containing competitive inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE, against esterase activity of carbonic anhydrase, CA was investigated. This small molecule, as well as enalapril, was selected in order to represents both thiol and carboxylate, as two well-known metal binding functional groups of metalloprotein inhibitors. Since captopril, has also been observed to inhibit other metalloenzymes such as tyrosinase and metallo-beta lactamase through binding to the catalytic metal ions and regarding CA as a zinc-containing metallo-enzyme, in the current study, we set out to determine whether captopril/enalapril inhibit CA esterase activity of the purified human CA II or not? Then, we revealed the inhibitors' potencies (IC50, Ki and Kdiss values) and also mode of inhibition. Our results also showed that enalapril is more potent CA inhibitor than captopril. Since enalapril represents no sulfhydryl moiety, thus carboxylate group may have a determinant role in inhibiting of CA esterase activity, the conclusion confirmed by molecular docking studies. Additionally, since CA inhibitory potencies of captopril/enalapril were much lower than those of classic sulfonamide drugs, the findings of the current study may explain why these drugs exhibit no effective CA inhibition at the concentrations reached in\u00a0vivo and also may shed light on the way of generating new class of inhibitors that will discriminately inhibit various CA isoforms.", 
    "920": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are known to cause angioedema. Most ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema cases describe swelling in the periorbital region, tongue, and pharynx. We describe a case of a 62-year-old female with presumed angioedema of the small bowel after more than a 2-year history of lisinopril use (with no recent changes in her dose of 40 mg orally twice daily). The patient presented with nausea and intermittent left middle and upper quadrant abdominal pain and denied history of angioedema or swelling with any medications or any history of abdominal pain. On physical examination, bowel sounds, liver, and spleen were normal. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis (15 400 per mm(3)) and normal complement 1 esterase inhibitor levels. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed segmental small bowel thickening and edema with ascites and surrounding inflammatory changes. There was no lymphadenopathy, obstruction, or ileus. Two days after discontinuation of the lisinopril, the patient reported improvement in symptoms. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicated a probable relationship (score of 7) between the development of angioedema of the small bowel and the lisinopril therapy. This case highlights the unique manner in which ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema may present. A review of published cases of ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema of the small bowel is provided.",

    "925": "Cardiac amyloidosis is an underrecognized condition, in which delays to diagnosis have great implications on management options, prognosis, and morbidity. Once cardiac tissue is infiltrated by amyloid fibrils, there is a cascade of pathologic changes that can display an array of clinical manifestations, from impaired relaxation of the ventricular myocardium to severe restrictive disease or even progressive systolic heart failure. Management is guided not only by recognizing the subtype of amyloidosis (primary, hereditary, and wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis), but also the clinical stage of the disease. It is important for those managing such patients to understand and differentiate disease associated with fibrils composed of transthyretin vs light-chain proteins. Kappa- and lambda-light chains of primary amyloidosis are particularly toxic to myocytes, leading to accelerated clinical illness in the face of intolerance to treatment and poor survival. Limitations to treatment of primary cardiac amyloidosis are related to multiorgan dysfunction and the inability to tolerate appropriate chemotherapy. Bortezomib, a selective protease inhibitor, has been shown to be and an effective and tolerable option for those with myocardial amyloid infiltration. Standard goal-directed optimal medical management for cardiomyopathy (such as beta-blockers and ace inhibitors) does not offer a survival benefit with cardiac amyloidosis, and often is associated with adverse effects. Despite advances in treatment of advanced heart failure therapy, end-stage cardiomyopathy in the setting of amyloidosis is not well stabilized by inotropes or mechanical circulatory support, and offers restricted candidacy for heart transplantation. We review the salient features of cardiac amyloidosis to help general practitioners and subspecialists manage this unique clinical condition.", 
    "926": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a recently described member of the renin-angiotensin system that hydrolyzes angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7), and may thereby protect against cardiovascular and renal diseases. ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane protein and contains a catalytically active ectodomain that can be shed from the cell surface into the extracellular space, via cleavage by a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM-17). ACE2 enzymatic activity and protein can be detected in biological fluids, including urine, plasma, and conditioned cell culture media. We present a detailed method for measurement of ACE2 activity in biological fluids, using hydrolysis of an intramolecularly quenched fluorogenic ACE2 substrate, in the absence or presence of the ACE2 inhibitors MLN-4760 or DX600. Recombinant human or mouse ACE2 is used to generate standard curves for this assay, with ACE2 detection ranging from 1.56 to 50 ng/ml. While MLN-4760 potently inhibits the activity of both human and mouse ACE2, DX600 (linear form) only effectively blocks human ACE2 activity in this assay. In biological samples of human and mouse urine, cell culture medium from mouse proximal tubular cells, and mouse plasma, the mean intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) of the assay range from 1.43 to 4.39 %, and from 7.01 to 13.17 %, respectively. We present data on the time and substrate concentration dependence of the assay, and show that exogenous D -glucose, creatinine, urea, and albumin do not interfere with its performance. In biological fluids, this assay is a simple and reliable method to study the role of ACE2 and its shed fragments in cardiovascular and renal diseases.",

STZ was injected intraperitoneally with single dose of 50mg/kg for diabetes induction. In order to develop DN the animals were left in diabetes condition without any treatment during the following 4 weeks. Betanin (25, 50 and 100mg/kg/day) and lisinopril (5mg/kg/day, reference compound) were orally administered for 8 weeks after the induction of DN. Renal function, blood glucose, serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and antioxidant enzyme activities in the kidney tissue were measured.

The results showed that betanin attenuated diabetic kidney injury by significantly inhibiting proteinuria, blood glucose, serum creatinine and BUN levels and restored antioxidant enzyme activities in kidney tissue. Histological studies exhibited that betanin treatment reduced the glomerular surface area, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Furthermore, betanin modulated mRNA and protein expression of TGF-\u03b2, type IV collagen, \u03b1-SMA and E-cadherin in kidney.",

    "936": "Heart failure remains a\u00a0frequent cause of death and is the leading reason for hospitalization in Germany although therapeutic options have significantly increased over the past years particularly in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Clinical symptoms are usually preceded by cardiac remodeling, which was originally defined only by left ventricular dilatation and depressed function but is also associated with typical cellular and molecular processes. Healing after acute myocardial infarction is characterized by inflammation, cellular migration and scar formation. Cardiac remodeling is accompanied by adaptive changes of the peripheral cardiovascular system. Since prevention is the primary goal, rapid diagnosis and treatment of myocardial infarction are mandatory. Early reperfusion therapy limits infarct size and enables the best possible preservation of left ventricular function. Standard pharmacotherapy includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-1-receptor blockers and beta blockers. In addition, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have proven beneficial. Compounds specifically targeting infarct healing processes are currently under development.",

The chronic neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease is characterized by a later onset of neurological symptoms and protracted neurological and visceral involvement. The first-choice treatment for nonneuronopathic Gaucher disease is enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant analogues of the deficient human enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Enzyme replacement therapy has been shown to improve hematological and bone manifestations associated with Gaucher disease, but, as with most proteins, recombinant enzymes cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, which prevents effects on neurological manifestations. Substrate reduction therapy with miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin) inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, which catalyzes the first step in glycosphingolipid synthesis. Because miglustat can cross the blood-brain barrier, it has been suggested that, combined with enzyme replacement therapy, it might be effective in treating neurological symptoms in patients with neuronopathic Gaucher disease.",

He experienced mild diarrhea after commencing miglustat therapy, which decreased in frequency/severity over time. His splenomegaly was reduced, and his hematological values and plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity normalized. Plasma chitotriosidase also showed substantial and sustained decreases. After 5 years of combination therapy, the patient showed no signs of neurological impairment.",

    "950": "Chronic subdural haematoma (cSDH), one of the most common neurosurgical entities, occurs typically in elderly patients. The incidence is expected to double by the year 2030, owing to the continuous aging of the population. Surgery is usually the treatment of choice, but conservative treatment may be a good alternative in some situations. We provide a systematic review of studies analysing the conservative treatment options and the natural history of cSDH. Of 231 articles screened, 35 were included in this systematic review. Studies evaluating the natural history and conservative treatment modalities of cSDH remain sparse and are predominantly of low level of evidence. The natural history of cSDH remains unclear and is analysed only in case reports or very small case series. \"Wait and watch\" or \"wait and scan\" management is indicated in patients with no or minor symptoms (Markwalder score 0-1). However, it seems that there are no clear clinical or radiological signs indicating whether the cSDH will resolve spontaneously or not (type C recommendation). In symptomatic patients who are not worsening or in a comatose state, oral steroid treatment might be an alternative to surgery (type C recommendation). Tranexamic acid proved effective in a small patient series (type C recommendation), but its risk of increasing thromboembolic events in patients treated with antithrombotic or anticoagulant medication is unclear. Angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors were evaluated only as adjuvant therapy to surgery, and their effect on the rate of recurrence remains debatable. Mannitol showed promising results in small retrospective series and might be a valid treatment modality (type C recommendation). However, the long treatment duration is a major drawback. Patients presenting without paresis can be treated with a platelet activating factor receptor antagonist (type C recommendation), since they seem to promote resolution of the haematoma, especially in patients with hygromas or low-density haematomas on computed tomography. Lastly, atorvastatin seems to be a safe option for the conservative treatment of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cSDH patients (type C recommendation). In conclusion, our knowledge of the conservative treatment modalities for cSDH is sparse and based on small case series and low grade evidence. However, some treatment modalities seem promising even in symptomatic patients with large haematomas. Randomised controlled trials are currently underway, and will hopefully provide us with good evidence for or against the conservative treat-ment of cSDH.",

The patient was comanaged by cardiology, who carefully monitored measures of cardiac function, including EKGs, serial echocardiograms, and profiling of lipids, troponin, and pro-BNP every 2 months. The patient was treated with the cardioprotective agent dexrazoxane, and changes in cardiac markers [e.g. decreases in ejection fraction (EF)] were immediately addressed by therapeutic intervention with the ACE inhibitor lisinopril and beta-blocker metoprolol. The patient had a complete response to doxorubicin therapy, with a cumulative dose of 1,350 mg/m(2), which is significantly above the recommended limits, and to our knowledge, the highest dose reported in literature. Two and a half years after the last doxorubicin cycle, the patient is asymptomatic with no cardiotoxicity and an excellent quality of life. This case highlights the importance of careful monitoring and management of doxorubicin-mediated cardiotoxicity, and that higher cumulative doses of anthracyclines can be considered in patients with ongoing clinical benefit.",

Since no data were found in the literature regarding the spectroscopic description, thermal behavior, or decomposition kinetics of perindopril, our goal was the evaluation of the compatibility of this antihypertensive agent with the excipients in the tablet under ambient conditions and to study the effect of thermal treatment on the stability of perindopril erbumine. ATR-FTIR (Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy, thermal analysis (thermogravimetric mass curve (TG-thermogravimetry), derivative thermogravimetric mass curve (DTG), and heat flow (HF)) and model-free kinetics were chosen as investigational tools. Since thermal behavior is a simplistic approach in evaluating the thermal stability of pharmaceuticals, in-depth kinetic studies were carried out by classical kinetic methods (Kissinger and ASTM E698) and later with the isoconversional methods of Friedman, Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa. It was shown that the main thermal degradation step of perindopril erbumine is characterized by activation energy between 59 and 69 kJ/mol (depending on the method used), while for the tablet, the values were around 170 kJ/mol. The used excipients (anhydrous colloidal silica, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, and magnesium stearate) should be used in newly-developed generic solid pharmaceutical formulations, since they contribute to an increased thermal stability of perindopril erbumine.", 
    "961": "Our previous studies have shown that Coix glutelin pepsin hydrolysate can effectively inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity in vitro. The main purpose of this study was to obtain potent anti-hypertensive peptides from Coix glutelin. The Coix glutelin hydrolysates (CGH) were prepared by pepsin catalysis and further separated by an ultrafitration (UF) system, gel filtration chromatography (GFC) and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). As a result, the sub-fraction F5-3 had the highest ACE-inhibitory activity. Six ACE inhibitory peptides were identifiedusing nano-liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The most potent peptide GAAGGAF (IC50 = 14.19 \u03bcmol\u00b7L(-1)) was finally obtained by further molecular simulation screening and a series of division and optimization. Single oral administration of synthesized GAAGGAF at 15 mg/kg body weight (BW) in spontaneously hypertensively rats (SHR) could reduce the systolic blood pressure (SBP) around 27.50 mmHg and blood pressure-lowering effect lasted for at least 8 h. The study demonstrated for the first time that the ACE inhibitory peptide GAAGGAF from Coix glutelin has a significant antihypertensive effect, and it could be a good natural ingredient for pharmaceuticals against hypertension and the related diseases.",

At this point, the effect of systemic medication on IOP in eyes with glaucoma is not well elucidated but important. Our findings indicate that patients with glaucoma may potentially be at risk of higher or lower IOP, depending on medication class, and this would in turn affect management of IOP control.",

The current standard for monitoring cardiac function detects cardiotoxicity only when a functional impairment has already occurred, not allowing for any early preventive strategy. Areas covered: A novel approach, based on the use of biomarkers has recently emerged, resulting in a very effective tool for early, real-time identi\ufb01cation, and monitoring of cardiotoxicity. In particular, cardiac troponin elevation during chemotherapy allows to identify patients more prone to develop myocardial dysfunction and cardiac events. In these patients, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as enalapril, has shown to be effective in improving clinical outcomes, giving the chance for cardioprotective strategies in a selected population. The authors reviewed the currently available data about the role of biomarkers in this setting. Expert commentary: Early identification of patients at high risk of cardiotoxicity by cardiac biomarkers - in particular troponin - provides a rationale for targeted preventive strategies against cancer therapy-induced left ventricular dysfunction and its associated clinical complications, with the advantage of limiting prophylactic therapy only to a restricted number of patients. Although the major international oncologic societies encourage this approach, some limitations to a routinely use of biomarkers still exist.",

    "975": "We found that both ACE-Is promoted similar endothelial fibrinolytic properties and decreased oxidative stress in vitro. Propofol alone increased the release of antifibrinolytic and pro-oxidative factors from the endothelium and increased mRNA iNOS expression.

Forty envenomed children (22 mild and 18 severe cases) along with 10 healthy control children were enrolled in the study. The circulating levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline, Ang II, ACE, kallikrein enzyme, and NO were determined by ELISA, and spectrophotometric assays on admission and 24\u00a0h later. On admission, serum aldosterone, and electrolytes; Na(+), K(+) and Ca(+2) were determined by RIA, Flame photometer and Flame atomic absorption respectively. All envenomed children showed significant surge of adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACE, Ang II, aldosterone, NO and Na(+), that concomitantly faced by significant reduction in kallikrein, K(+) and Ca(+2) on admission. Twenty four hours later, all envenomed children continued to show significant elevation of ACE, Ang II and NO. The severely envenomed children showed considerable reduction in circulating levels of adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACE and Ang II, while dramatic increase in kallikrein activity was reported in comparison to mildly envenomed children after 24\u00a0h of medical care. Also, NO exhibited considerable accumulation in non survivors, on admission, that was persistent for the subsequent 24\u00a0h and was accompanied by high kallikrein, low catecholamines and Ang II levels compared to survivors. Finally, the hypertensive cases showed substantial higher levels of catecholamine, ACE and Ang II, 24\u00a0h after admission. These findings indicated that, disturbances of the studied vasoactive mediators were common in scorpion envenomed children and may account for several inflammatory manifestations and clinical outcome. ACE inhibitors could be considered as possible therapeutic agent in victims with prominent increase in ACE and Ang II while kallikrein inhibitor and antioxidants may be effective in the treatment of late hypotensive ones.",

ACEI have been extensively described as effective in the treatment of hypertension among adults, but also as drugs delaying progression in diabetic nephropathy and reducing mortality in left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure. What is less obvious, ACEI are also widely used in pediatric nephrology and cardiology. Moreover, there are more and more reports showing evidence that ACEI can be beneficial in the treatment of many other diseases and the pleiotropic activity of ACEI is mainly based on their antioxidant properties. In this paper we focus on the less obvious possibilities of the clinical use of ACEI in neurological or oncological patients, discuss the role of ACE gene polymorphism and show the perspectives of potentially new applications of ACEI in contemporary pharmacotherapy.",

The porous structure of paper can effectively retain salts from entering mass spectrometer. This makes the measurement of drug content within dissolution media by mass spectrometer possible. After the experimental parameters were optimized, calibration curves of model drugs - enalapril, quinapril and benazepril were established by using corresponding deuterated internal standards. PSI-MS was then deployed to characterize the content of enalapril from the dissolution testing of enalapril tablets. The results from PSI-MS are comparable to those from HPLC characterization. More importantly, the analysis time of 6 samples is shortened from 90min to 6min. Detection limit of enalapril maleate tablets by PSI-MS is 1/300 of LC.

Expert opinion: Based on the PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril-valsartan offers compelling reductions in meaningful clinical endpoints, independent of age or severity of disease. The rate of adverse events was comparable between the enalapril and sacubitril-valsartan groups, although the absolute rates are likely underestimated due to the entry criteria and run-in period. Future trials and post-market surveillance are critical to better understand the risk of angioedema in high risk populations, particularly African-Americans, as well as long-term theoretical risks including the potential for increased cerebral amyloid plaque deposition with possible development of neurocognitive disease.

    "1009": "Randomized controlled trials have concluded that the cardiovascular outcome of first-step treatment of hypertension with traditional vasoconstricting beta-blockers is inferior to treatment with other antihypertensive drug classes. Beta-blocker use is also associated with undesirable side effects. Consequently, some recent guidelines consider beta-blockers an inferior option for first-step treatment of hypertension. Despite this, beta-blockers are still widely prescribed, and likely overused, in the management of hypertension. It is the contention of this perspective that beta-blockers do have an important role in treating hypertension, but their use needs to be much better targeted, by better identification of both the right patient and the right beta-blocker. Identifying the right patient involves consideration of underlying mechanisms of hypertension. In the absence of comorbidities for which a beta-blocker is indicated, beta-blockers would not seem to be the preferred treatment for patients with either sodium/volume-mediated hypertension, for which they are usually ineffective, or for those with renin-angiotensin system-mediated hypertension, for which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers provide equal antihypertensive efficacy with evidence of better outcome and fewer adverse effects. Beta-blockers would instead appear to be best suited for patients with sympathetically driven, that is, neurogenic, hypertension, whether as a first-step drug, such as in patients with hypertension in the acute post-stroke period, in so-called \"hyperkinetic\" patients, and in patients with labile hypertension, or as an add-on drug in patients with resistant hypertension. In choosing among the beta-blockers, combined alpha/beta-blockade offers advantages over beta-blocker monotherapy and merits greater clinical and research attention. Finally, unreliable bioavailability greatly interferes with the effectiveness of lipophilic, but not nonlipophilic, beta-blockers. Clinical effectiveness could be improved with greater focus on the beta-blockers with the more favorable pharmacokinetics.",

However, no differences were found between groups in repeat PCI (P\u2009=\u20090.32). Cox proportional hazard model revealed that age, chronic kidney disease (CKD), previous MI and stroke history were risk factors for all-cause mortality (OR: 1.05,1.89, 2.87, and 4.12, respectively), and use of beta-blockers (BB) and statins reduced all-cause mortality (OR: 0.47 and 0.35, respectively).

The inhibition of ACE with natural inhibitors, as alternatives to avoid the side effect of synthetic drugs, is a major target in the prevention of hypertension. In this study, we examined the separated caseins and whey proteins of goat milk for the presence of ACE inhibitory peptides. Digestion of isolated whey proteins and caseins of goat milk by gastric pepsin generated soluble hydrolysates exhibiting significant inhibition of ACE compared to weak inhibition by undigested proteins. The hydrolysates were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography, Sephacryl S-100 column, into four fractions (F1-F4). The late-eluting fraction (F4) of either whey or caseins exhibited greater ACE inhibition. Peptides in both F4 fractions, isolated by RP-HPLC, exhibited variable ACE inhibitory activities with the hydrophobic peptide peaks being the most potent ACE inhibitors. MALDI-TOF MS/MS resulted in identification of three potent ACE inhibitory peptides: PEQSLACQCL from \u03b2-lactoglobulin (residues 113-122), QSLVYPFTGPI from \u03b2-casein (residues 56-66), and ARHPHPHLSFM from \u03ba-casein (residues 96-106). The peptides from whey and caseins exert significant ACE inhibitory activities comparable to that of captopril, an antihypertensive drug, exhibiting IC50 values of 4.45\u00a0\u03bcM and 4.27\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. The results introduce, for the first time, new potent ACE-inhibitory peptides that can be released by gastric pepsin of goat milk whey and caseins and thus may pave the way for their candidacy as anti-hypertensive bioactive peptides and prevention of associated disorders.", 
    "1016": "Increased levels of oxidative stress have been suggested to play a detrimental role in the development of diabetes-related vascular complications. Here, we investigated whether the concentration of malondialdehyde, a marker of lipid oxidation correlated to the degree of aortic plaque lesions in a proatherogenic diabetic mouse model. Three groups of apolipoprotein E knockout mice were studied for 20 weeks, a control, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic, and a diabetic enalapril-treated group. Enalapril was hypothesized to lower oxidative stress level and thus the plaque burden. Both diabetic groups were significantly different from the control group as they had higher blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, together with a lower high-density lipoprotein concentration and body weight. Animals in the diabetic group had significantly higher plaque area and plasma malondialdehyde than controls. The two diabetic groups did not differ significantly in any measured characteristic. In summary, there was a positive correlation between plasma malondialdehyde concentration and aorta plaque area in apolipoprotein E knockout. Even though further investigation of the role of lipid oxidation in the development of atherosclerosis is warranted, these results suggest that biomarkers of lipid oxidation may be of value in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk.",

    "1021": "Cryptome is as a subset of a given proteome containing bioactive cryptides embedded in larger peptides or proteins. We pinpointed a striking sequence similarity between two peptides from the Tityus serrulatus venom: Ts10 (KKDGYPVEYDRAY) and the N-terminal of Ts3 (KKDGYPVEYDNCAY). Ts3 (former Tityustoxin or TsIV) is an \u03b1-neurotoxin acting on voltage-gated sodium channels while Ts10 (former Peptide T) is a bradykinin-potentiating peptide and was originally reported as inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACEi). Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate whether such peptide hidden in the N-terminal of Ts3 (Ts31-14[C12S]) was able to mimic known effects of Ts10 as well as to expand the current knowledge of the vascular effects and molecular targets of these peptides. Similar to Ts10, Ts31-14[C12S] was able to potentiate the hypotensive effect of bradykinin (BK). However, none of these peptides was able to induce a long-lasting BK-potentiating effect, suggesting that this effect may not be their main biological outcome. On the other hand, we report that Ts10 and mainly Ts31-14[C12S] induced a strong vasodilation effect depending on the presence of functional endothelium and nitric oxide (NO) production. Unlike previously reported, Ts10 was not able to inhibit ACE activity (similar result was observed for Ts31-14[C12S]). On the other hand, we report that Ts31-14[C12S] induces vasodilation via the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) M2 and M3 while only the activation of mAChR M2 seems to be required for Ts10-induced vasodilation.",

Echocardiogram showed a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction to 35% with severely hypokinetic anterior wall and left ventricular apex was severely hypokinetic. EMG nerve conduction study showed severely decreased conduction velocity and prolonged distal latency in all nerves consistent with demyelinating disease. She was treated with 5days of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to which she showed significant improvement in strength in her lower extremities.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare complication of Miller-Fisher syndrome and literature review did not reveal any cases. Miller-Fisher syndrome is an autoimmune process that affects the peripheral nervous system causing autonomic dysfunction which may involve the heart. Due to significant autonomic dysfunction in Miller-Fisher syndrome, it could lead to arrhythmias, blood pressure changes, acute coronary syndrome and myocarditis, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can be difficult to distinguish. The treatment of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is supportive with beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are recommended until left ventricle ejection fraction improvement. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare complication during the acute phase of Miller-Fisher syndrome and must be distinguished from autonomic dysfunction as both diagnoses have different approaches to treatment.",

Using the French Registry of ST-Elevation and Non-ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (FAST-MI) 2010 registry, we investigated whether previous manifestations of atherosclerotic disease (i.e., previous MI, or a history of any form of atherosclerotic disease) are at truly increased risk compared with those in whom AMI is the first manifestation of the disease. FAST-MI 2010 is a nationwide French registry including 3,079 patients with AMI, among whom 1,062 patients had a history of cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease and 498 patients had a history of MI. Overall, patients with a history of atherosclerotic disease (or MI) were older compared with patients without known cardiovascular disease (71 \u00b1 13 vs 63 \u00b1 14\u00a0years) and had higher cardiovascular risk profiles and co-morbidities. Using fully adjusted Cox multivariate analysis, previous manifestations of atherosclerotic disease were associated with higher 3-year mortality (hazard ratio 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.40 to 2.31; p <0.001) as history of previous MI alone (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 1.73; p\u00a0= 0.048). Similar results were found in patients discharged alive. In conclusion, previous cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease represents 1/3 of patients with AMI and are strongly associated with worse long-term clinical outcomes.

Seventy-three consecutive patients with SSc (67 women and 6 men), mean age 56.2\u00a0years, mean disease duration 6.7\u00a0years, were included in this cross-sectional study. GFR was measured by creatinine clearance (CCr) in all patients, as well as 24-h proteinuria. We assessed frequency and severity of renal insufficiency in our patients with SSc and estimated the association of renal insufficiency with age, disease duration, subtype of the disease, earlier diagnosed arterial hypertension, and medications for which we assumed to affect renal function-cytostatics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, ACE inhibitors, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers (CCB). Fifty-six out of 73 patients with SSc (76.7%) had reduced GFR (CCr lower than 90\u00a0ml/min), compared to 17/73 (23.3%) of patients with normal renal function.

End-stage renal disease (CCr\u00a0<\u00a015\u00a0ml/min) was found in 2/73 (2.7%) of patients. Using the univariate general linear statistical model, we have found that previously diagnosed arterial hypertension and treatment with glucocorticoids are independent risk factors for reduced GFR. On the other hand, age, disease duration, disease form, as well as antibodies (anticentromere antibodies-ACA and anti-topoisomerase I antibodies-ATA) were excluded as independent risk factors. Patients with SSc and arterial hypertension treated with CCB had significantly higher mean CCr than patients treated with diuretics (90.4 vs 53.5\u00a0ml/min, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), or patients treated with ACE inhibitors (90.4 vs 41.7\u00a0ml/min, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Decreased GFR is common in SSc. Most of patients have mild or moderate renal insufficiency.

Double logistic curve fit analysis showed that the rate and power of increase in systolic pressure during the transition from light to dark was reduced by 50% and 65%, respectively, but had no effect on diastolic pressure. Rilmenidine also reduced blood pressure variability in the autonomic frequency in the active period as assessed by spectral analysis which is consistent with reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity. Perindopril had no effect on the rate or power of the arousal surge in either systolic or diastolic pressure. These results suggest that the arousal induced surge in blood pressure can largely be reduced by an antihypertensive agent that inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, while effective in reducing blood pressure, does not alter the rate or power of the surge associated with arousal.",

All the included articleswere retrieved from MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database. Trial eligibility and methodological quality were assessed before data extraction. Relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were used to assess the effect. Six case-control studies with11,387,668 participants met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. A small but significant risk effect on fractures was shown in the overall analysis of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor users compared with nonusers (Pooled RR 1.27; 95% CI 1.01-1.60), although a relatively high heterogeneity was found across studies. In the stratified analysis, therewas no statistically significant association in the subgroups of hip fracture (Pooled RR 1.14; 95% CI 0.73-1.76) and the study quality (Pooled RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.89-1.44), while the over 65-year-old angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor users showed a stronger risk effect on fractures (Pooled RR 2.06; 95% CI 1.53-3.17). Moreover, age was found to be contributed a large part of the high heterogeneity across the included studies. This study demonstrated that the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might have a small but significant risk effect on fractures, especially for the over 65-year-old users. These results should be interpreted with caution as the relatively high heterogeneity across studies. Additional multiple observational studies and high quality data from randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

These 2 peptides were synthesized and assessed for angiotensin 1-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory capacity before and after incubation with a monolayer of Caco-2 intestinal cells. The VYPFPGPIHN was a stronger ACE inhibitor than VYPFPGPIPN, with the concentration needed to reach half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of 123 \u00b1 14.2 \u03bcM versus 656 \u00b1 7.6 \u03bcM. Exposure to a Caco-2 intestinal cell monolayer did not affect ACE inhibition by VYPFPGPIHN, but resulted in an almost 2-fold increase in inhibition by VYPFPGPIPN after incubation. Subsequent tandem mass spectrometric analysis identified the truncated peptide VYPFPGPIP, suggesting hydrolysis by a cell membrane associated peptidase.

Although commonly encountered in clinical practice, its characterization and differences with true idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) are lacking. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical instrumental features and the natural history of HHC. We analyzed the data of 4,191 patients referred to our center for newly diagnosed LV systolic dysfunction from 2005 to 2010. Of them, 310 presented idiopathic LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction <50%): 136 (44%) had a history of systemic hypertension and were defined HHC. The remaining 174 patients were considered IDC. Compared with patients with IDC, those with HHC were older (63 \u00b1 11 vs 47 \u00b1 14\u00a0years, p <0.001), with worse comorbidity profile, higher blood pressure, and increased LV mass. During follow-up, patients with HHC showed earlier and higher proportion of LV reverse remodeling (46% vs 21% at 6\u00a0months' follow-up). Moreover, they had a better long-term survival free from cardiovascular death/ventricular assist device/heart transplant/malignant ventricular arrhythmias (5.1 vs 12.6 in HHC and IDC, p\u00a0= 0.03). Indeed, their mortality was mainly driven by noncardiovascular causes (at 10\u00a0years 9.6% vs 1.7% in HHC and IDC, p <0.001). In conclusion, HHC has a high prevalence among patients with \"idiopathic\" LV dysfunction. The natural history of patients with HHC is characterized by a rapid response to optimal therapy for heart failure, a favorable cardiovascular outcome, and a relevant incidence of noncardiovascular events.",

The hydrolyzed bioactive oligopeptides of adlay have been proven to be anti-hypertensive effective components. However, the structures and anti-hypertensive mechanism of bioactive oligopeptides from adlay were not clear. To discover the definite anti-hypertensive oligopeptides from adlay, in silico proteolysis and virtual screening were implemented to obtain potential oligopeptides, which were further identified by biochemistry assay and molecular dynamics simulation. In this paper, ten sequences of adlay prolamins were collected and in silico hydrolyzed to construct the oligopeptide library with 134 oligopeptides. This library was reverse screened by anti-hypertensive pharmacophore database, which was constructed by our research team and contained ten anti-hypertensive targets. Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) was identified as the main potential target for the anti-hypertensive activity of adlay oligopeptides. Three crystal structures of ACE were utilized for docking studies and 19 oligopeptides were finally identified with potential ACE inhibitory activity. According to mapping features and evaluation indexes of pharmacophore and docking, three oligopeptides were selected for biochemistry assay. An oligopeptide sequence, NPATY (IC50 = 61.88 \u00b1 2.77 \u00b5M), was identified as the ACE inhibitor by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) assay. Molecular dynamics simulation of NPATY was further utilized to analyze interactive bonds and key residues. ALA354 was identified as a key residue of ACE inhibitors. Hydrophobic effect of VAL518 and electrostatic effects of HIS383, HIS387, HIS513 and Zn(2+) were also regarded as playing a key role in inhibiting ACE activities. This study provides a research strategy to explore the pharmacological mechanism of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) proteins based on in silico proteolysis and virtual screening, which could be beneficial to reveal the pharmacological action of TCM proteins and provide new lead compounds for peptides-based drug design.",

ACE is a zinc dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that contains two extracellular domains (nACE and cACE). In this study the molecular basis for the selectivity of sampatrilat for nACE and cACE was investigated. Enzyme inhibition assays were performed to evaluate the in vitro ACE domain selectivity of sampatrilat. The inhibition of the C-domain (Ki = 13.8 nM) by sampatrilat was 12.4-fold more potent than that for the N-domain (171.9 nM), indicating differences in affinities for the respective ACE domain binding sites. Interestingly, replacement of the P2 group of sampatrilat with an aspartate abrogated its C-selectivity and lowered the potency of the inhibitor to activities in the micromolar range. The molecular basis for this selective profile was evaluated using molecular modeling methods. We found that the C-domain selectivity of sampatrilat is due to occupation of the lysine side chain in the S1 and S2 subsites and interactions with Glu748 and Glu1008, respectively.

A fourth was \"meta-analysis of beta-blockers AND hypertension AND age AND death, stroke, myocardial infarction\" RESULTS: Diastolic (with or without systolic) hypertension, in contrast to isolated systolic hypertension, occurs primarily in younger subjects, and is linked to overweight/obesity and increased sympathetic nerve activity. In younger/middle-aged hypertensive subjects, high plasma norepinephrine levels are linked (independent of blood pressure) to an increased risk of future cardiovascular events and death. High resting heart rates (a surrogate for high sympathetic nerve activity) likewise predict premature all-cause death, coronary heart disease and cardiovascular events in younger hypertensive subjects. In this younger/middle-aged hypertensive group, antihypertensive agents that increase sympathetic nerve activity (diuretics, dihydropyridine calcium blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)) do not decrease (and may increase) the risk of myocardial infarction, and are therefore inappropriate first-line agents in this age-group. By contrast, in younger/middle-aged hypertensive subjects (less than 60\u00a0years old), meta-analysis has shown that beta-blockers are significantly superior to randomised placebo, and at least as effective as randomised comparator agents, in reducing death/stroke/myocardial infarction. In this younger/middle-aged hypertensive group beta-blockers have been shown (vs randomised placebo or diuretics) to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction by 35-50\u2009%, and stroke by 50-55\u2009% (vs placebo), in non-smoker men. Atenolol was at least as effective as ACE-inhibition (captopril) in reducing all 7 cardiovascular endpoints (including stroke which was reduced by 50\u2009%), vs less tight control of blood pressure, in obese hypertensive subjects with type-2 diabetes (UKPDS study); and after 20 years follow-up, atenolol was significantly (23\u2009%) superior to the ACE-inhibitor in reducing the risk of all-cause death (beta-blockers have anti-cancer properties, which maybe relevant).",

In this age-group high resting heart rates and high plasma norepinephrine levels (independent of blood pressure) are linked to premature cardiovascular events and death. Thus, anti-hypertensive agents that increase sympathetic nerve activity ie diuretics, dihydropyridine calcium blockers, and ARBs, are inappropriate first-line choices in this younger age-group. Beta-blockers perform well vs randomised placebo and other antihypertensive agents regarding reduced risk of death/stroke/myocardial infarction in younger (<60\u00a0years) hypertensive subjects, and are a reasonable first-line choice of therapy (certainly in men). These facts should be reflected in the recommendations of guideline committees around the world.",

In the envenomed group, results revealed severe tissue alterations with a concomitant increase of metabolic enzymes (CK and CK-MB) in sera. An important inflammatory cell (neutrophil and eosinophil) infiltration into the heart and aorta were observed, accompanied by imbalanced redox status (NO, MDA, catalase and GSH) and high cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) in sera with the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 metalloproteinases. However, the blockade of the actions of AngII by the ACE inhibitor or by the AT1R antagonist prevented cardiac and aortic tissue alterations, inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as the oxidative stress generation and cytokine and metalloproteinase expression. These results suggest the involvement of AngII, through its AT1R in the inflammation induced by Aah venom, in the heart and the aorta.",

This pathological activation and inadequate functioning of endothelial cells was shown to be to some extent a reversible process, which all together resulted in increased interest in investigation of different beneficial treatment options. To this point, the pharmacological approach, including for example, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or statins, was clearly shown to be effective in the improvement of ED. One of many critical issues underlying ED represents instability in the balance between nitric oxide and angiotensin II (Ang II) production. Considering that Ang II was confirmed to be important for the development of ED, the aim of this review article was to summarize the findings of up to date clinical studies associated with therapeutic application of angiotensin receptor blockers and improvement in ED.

This analysis examined the relation between the intensity of guideline-directed HF medical therapy and global (123)I-mIBG cardiac uptake in the AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure (ADMIRE-HF) database. A second objective was to investigate whether this guideline-based therapy, measured by total medication doses, had the expected effect on outcome, that is, that patients with higher (123)I-mIBG cardiac uptake and more intensive medical therapy had the fewest outcome events. Three HF cardiologists developed an HF Medication Score (HFMS) to quantify adequacy of dosages of \u03b2 blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. A Cox model was used to investigate the predictive ability of the HFMS for mortality events during median 17\u00a0months follow-up. Multiple regression and Cox models assessed the usefulness of the HFMS relative to the planar heart/mediastinum ratio (H/Mp) from (123)I-mIBG imaging in prediction of an event and to characterize the interaction of HFMS and H/M in predicting an event. HFMS was not a significant predictor of all-cause or cardiac death in either univariate or multivariate Cox models; H/Mp was highly significant for both event categories (p <0.0001). Mean H/Mp did not differ among HFMS ranges 0 to 3, 4 to 6, and 7 to 9.

    "1194": "Hypertension is an important risk factor for premature death as it increases the probability of stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Antihypertensive drugs can decrease cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. The majority of hypertensive patients need more than one antihypertensive agent to attain blood pressure (BP) targets. Monotherapy can effectively reduce BP only in 20%-40% of patients. Multiple mechanisms including increased peripheral vascular resistance, increased cardiac work, and hypervolemia are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Targeting multiple pathways may more potently reduce BP. Increasing the dose of a single agent in many cases does not provide the expected BP-lowering effect because the underlying mechanism of the BP increase is either different or already corrected with the lower dose. Moreover, drugs acting on different pathways may have synergistic effects and thus better control hypertension. It is well known that diuretics enhance the actions of renin-angiotensin aldosterone system and activate it as a feedback to the reduced circulated blood volume. The addition of a renin-angiotensin aldosterone system blocker to a diuretic may more effectively reduce BP because the system is upregulated. Reducing the maximal dose of an agent may also reduce possible side effects if they are dose dependent. The increased prevalence of peripheral edema with higher doses of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) is reduced when renin-angiotensin aldosterone system blockers are added to CCBs through vein dilation. The effectiveness of the combination of enalapril with lercanidipine in reducing BP, the safety profile, and the use of the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors with CCBs in clinical trials with excellent CV hard end point outcomes make this combination a promising therapy in the treatment of hypertension.",

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers are recommended first-line agents for heart failure. We hypothesized that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers could prevent trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity. Patients and Methods In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive treatment with perindopril, bisoprolol, or placebo (1:1:1) for the duration of trastuzumab adjuvant therapy. Patients underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and post-cycle 17 for the determination of left ventricular volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Cardiotoxicity was evaluated as the change in indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume and LVEF. Results Thirty-three patients received perindopril, 31 received bisoprolol, and 30 received placebo. Baseline demographic, cancer, and cardiovascular profiles were similar between groups. Study drugs were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. After 17 cycles of trastuzumab, indexed left ventricular end diastolic volume increased in patients treated with perindopril (+7 \u00b1 14 mL/m(2)), bisoprolol (+8 mL \u00b1 9 mL/m(2)), and placebo (+4 \u00b1 11 mL/m(2); P = .36).

Perindopril and bisoprolol use were independent predictors of maintained LVEF on multivariable analysis. Conclusion Perindopril and bisoprolol were well tolerated in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer who received trastuzumab and protected against cancer therapy-related declines in LVEF; however, trastuzumab-mediated left ventricular remodeling-the primary outcome-was not prevented by these pharmacotherapies.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-II (Ang-II) production on heart tissue with ischemia-reperfusion damage, arrhythmia, and oxidative stress. MATERIAL AND METHODS Rats were divided into 4 groups: only ischemia/reperfusion (MI/R), captopril (CAP), aliskiren (AL), and CAP+AL. The drugs were given by gavage 30 min before anesthesia. Blood pressure and electrocardiography (ECG) were recorded during MI/R procedures. The heart tissue and plasma was kept so as to evaluate the total oxidant (TOS), antioxidant status (TAS), and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB). RESULTS Creatine kinase-MB was not different among the groups. Although TAS was not affected by inhibition of Ang-II production, TOS was significantly lower in the CAP and/or AL groups than in the MI/R group. Furthermore, oxidative stress index was significantly attenuated in the CAP and/or AL groups. Captopril significantly increased the duration of VT during ischemia; however, it did not have any effect on the incidence of arrhythmias. During reperfusion periods, aliskiren and its combinations with captopril significantly reduced the incidence of other types of arrhythmias. Captopril alone had no effect on the incidence of arrhythmias, but significantly increased arrhythmias score and durations of arrhythmias during reperfusion. MAP and heart rate did not show changes in any groups during ischemic and reperfusion periods. CONCLUSIONS Angiotensin-II production appears to be associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, but Ang-II inhibitions increases arrhythmia, mainly by initiating ventricular ectopic beats.",

    "1216": "Hypertension is a common complication among post cardiac transplant recipients affecting more than 95% of patients. Increased blood pressure poses a significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients; it should be identified quickly and needs to be managed appropriately. Understanding the pathophysiology and contributing factors to this disease in these complex and unique patients is the key to appropriate treatment selection.", 
    "1217": "The description of blood pressure (BP) curve has evolved to include several noninvasively determined parameters, such as aortic stiffness, BP variability, wave reflections, and pulse pressure amplification. These techniques are likely to improve the efficacy of assessing pulsatile arterial hemodynamics and changes in arterial stiffness. The goal for future antihypertensive treatments should not only reduce steady BP, but also control pulsatile pressure and modify the stiffness gradient between central and peripheral arteries, which is frequently elevated. These changes have the potential to reduce residual cardiovascular risk but also to define drug strategies adapted to the needs of individual hypertensive subjects.", 
    "1218": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition that continues to increase in both incidence and prevalence. Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System is one of the main modulators of chronic hyperglycaemia and, thus, its influence on tissues. Hyperglycaemia-induced oxidative stress is an important factor in diabetic cardiomyopathy. The present study was carried out on 24 adult male Wistar albino rats (8-week-old and with body masses of 190\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010\u00a0g). We evaluated the influence of acute administration of zofenopril on ex vivo myocardial function from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, with a special emphasis on cardiodynamic and oxidative stress parameters in diabetic rat hearts. Rats were divided randomly into two groups (12 animals per group): control non-diabetic animals (C) were healthy rats perfused with 1.5\u00a0\u00b5M of zofenopril, and STZ-treated diabetic animals (DM) were diabetic animals perfused with 1.5\u00a0\u00b5M of zofenopril 4\u00a0weeks after the induction of diabetes. Our results demonstrated that diabetic rats are characterized by a depressed cardiac performance and that oxidative markers are related to alterations in cardiac function in rats with 4\u00a0weeks of STZ-induced diabetes. Additionally, the use of zofenopril as a monotherapy slightly diminished cardiac damage induced by chronic hyperglycaemia. However, long-term follow-up intervention trials are necessary to fully demonstrate the benefit of zofenopril in this context. A challenge for future investigations will be to identify the effects of chronic administration or combination therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in various models of diabetes.", 
    "1219": "Hypertension, a common feature in chronic kidney disease (CKD), is an independent risk factor for CKD progression and cardiovascular disease. Although inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exert salutary effects on blood pressure control and proteinuria in CKD patients, their activity towards traditional and novel oxidative markers is largely unknown. We studied the effects of 6-month treatment with telmisartan versus a combination of telmisartan and ramipril on plasma concentrations of low molecular mass (LMW, including homocysteine and cysteine) and protein thiols (PSH) plasma concentration and their relationships with carotid intima media thickness (IMT), in 24 hypertensive CKD patients (age 60 \u00b1 12 years, 8 females and 16 males). Pretreatment PSH concentrations were independently associated with IMT (r = -0.42, p = 0.039). Neither treatment affected plasma LMW thiols, in both reduced and total form. By contrast, both treatments increased PSH plasma concentrations and reduced IMT, although significant differences were only observed in the combined treatment group. Our results suggest that the beneficial effects of combined RAS inhibitor treatment on IMT in hypertensive CKD patients may be mediated by a reduction of oxidative stress markers, particularly PSH.", 
    "1220": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists are FDA-approved drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and are used to treat heart failure. Combined treatment with the ACEi lisinopril and the nonspecific MR antagonist spironolactone surprisingly improves skeletal muscle, in addition to heart function and pathology in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) mouse model. We recently demonstrated that MR is present in all limb and respiratory muscles and functions as a steroid hormone receptor in differentiated normal human skeletal muscle fibers. The goals of the current study were to begin to define cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the skeletal muscle efficacy of RAAS inhibitor treatment. We also compared molecular changes resulting from RAAS inhibition with those resulting from the current DMD standard-of-care glucocorticoid treatment. Direct assessment of muscle membrane integrity demonstrated improvement in dystrophic mice treated with lisinopril and spironolactone compared with untreated mice. Short-term treatments of dystrophic mice with specific and nonspecific MR antagonists combined with lisinopril led to overlapping gene-expression profiles with beneficial regulation of metabolic processes and decreased inflammatory gene expression. Glucocorticoids increased apoptotic, proteolytic, and chemokine gene expression that was not changed by RAAS inhibitors in dystrophic mice. Microarray data identified potential genes that may underlie RAAS inhibitor treatment efficacy and the side effects of glucocorticoids. Direct effects of RAAS inhibitors on membrane integrity also contribute to improved pathology of dystrophic muscles. Together, these data will inform clinical development of MR antagonists for treating skeletal muscles in DMD.", 
    "1221": "The renin-angiotensin system is classically regarded as a crucial regulator of circulatory homeostasis, but recent studies also revealed its pro-inflammatory roles. The beneficial effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) in severe inflammatory injury in the lung and heart have been previously reported, but its potential effects on lethal hepatitis were unknown. In this study, a mouse model with LPS/d-galactosamine (GalN)-induced fulminant hepatitis were used to test the protective potential of captopril, a representative ACEI. The results indicated that treatment with captopril significantly decreased the plasma level of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, alleviated the histopathological damage of the liver tissue and improve the survival rate of LPS/GalN-challenged mice. These effects were accompanied by reduced mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the liver, and decreased protein level of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the plasma. In addition, the activation of caspases 3, 8 and 9, and the presence of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells, were also suppressed by captopril treatment. The above evidence suggested that the renin-angiotensin system might be involved in the development of LPS/GalN-induced fulminant hepatitis and ACEI might have potential value in lethal hepatitis.",

We determined the level of blood pressure control, basic investigations documented as well as the choice of hypertensive treatment among patients attending a hypertension clinic in a national referral hospital, Mulago.", 
    "1265": "Of the 741 patients whose charts were reviewed the median age was 60\u00a0years, Inter quartile range (IQR) was 51-71. Six hundred forty-two (86.6%) were females. Blood pressure (BP) control defined as BP lowering to at least 140/90 was seen in only 198 (26.7%) patients. Biophysical measurement documentation was very low especially for waist and hip circumference at 0.3%. Majority of patients, 476 (64.2%) had at least one documented investigation for the complications of hypertension. Only 103 (13.9%) had all investigations documented in their charts. The investigations included; complete blood count (CBC), urinalysis, renal function tests (RFTs), Chest X-Ray (CXR), echocardiography (Echo) and electrocardiography (ECG). The commonly documented investigations were RFTs (45.5%), ECG (45.2%) and Echo (44.2%). The commonly prescribed anti hypertensive medications were; Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)/Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (72.74%), calcium channel blockers (72.3%) and thiazide diuretics (68.6%). Majority of patients were receiving three anti hypertensive medications 313 (42.2%), with 149 (43.6%) of these, on an ACEI/ARB, a calcium channel blocker and a thiazide diuretic.", 
    "1266": "Blood pressure control is suboptimal in a tertiary clinic setting at Mulago hospital and documentation of investigations is inadequate. ARB/ACEI, Calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics were the commonly prescribed anti hypertensive medications. There is a great need to investigate for renal and cardiac complications as well as exploring reasons for inadequate blood pressure control and consider appropriate interventions to avert bad outcomes.", 
    "1267": "A number of registry studies have reported suboptimal adherence to guidelines for cardiovascular prevention during the first year after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, only a few studies have addressed long-term secondary prevention after AMI. This study evaluates prevention guideline adherence and outcome of guideline-directed secondary prevention in patients surviving 2\u00a0years after AMI.", 
    "1268": "Patients aged 18-85\u00a0years at the time of their index AMI were consecutively identified from hospital discharge records between July 2010 and December 2011 in Gothenburg, Sweden. All patients who agreed to participate in the study (16.2%) were invited for a structured interview, physical examinations and laboratory analysis 2\u00a0years after AMI. Guideline-directed secondary preventive goals were defined as optimally controlled blood pressure, serum cholesterol, glucose, regular physical activity, smoking cessation and pharmacological treatment.", 
    "1269": "The mean age of the study cohort (n\u2009=\u2009200) at the index AMI was 63.0\u2009\u00b1\u20099.7\u00a0years, 79% were men. Only 3.5% of the cohort achieved all six guideline-directed secondary preventive goals 2\u00a0years after infarction. LDL\u2009<\u20091.8\u00a0mmol/L was achieved in 18.5% of the cohort, regular exercise in 45.5% and systolic blood pressure <140\u00a0mmHg in 57.0%. Anti-platelet therapy was used by 97% of the patients, beta-blockers by 83.0%, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers by 76.5% and statins by 88.5%. During follow-up, non-fatal adverse cardiovascular events (cardiac hospitalization, recurrent acute coronary syndrome, angina pectoris, new percutaneous coronary intervention, new onset of atrial fibrillation, post-infarct heart failure, pacemaker implantation, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA), cardiac surgery and cardiac arrest) occurred in 47% of the cohort and readmission due to cardiac causes in 30%.", 
    "1270": "Our data showed the failure of secondary prevention in our daily clinical practice and high rate of non-fatal adverse cardiovascular events 2\u00a0years after AMI.", 
    "1271": "Carp muscle tissue is a valuable source of biologically active constituents known to positively influence human health. In this study, carp protein digests/hydrolysates generated by human/ porcine digestive enzymes were analysed for their angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEi) activity. The ex vivo digests and in vitro hydrolysates were used in a screening for ACEi peptides as well. Carp proteins were hydrolysed more rapidly by human gastrointestinal juices than by porcine enzymes. Sarcoplasmic protein fractions were digested/hydrolysed more easily than the myofibrillar ones. The inhibitory concentrations at 50% (IC50) for ex vivo digested sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions were established at 1.50 and 1.04 mg/mL, respectively. While, for in vitro hydrolysed sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions, the IC50 values were calculated as 2.57 and 1.12 mg/mL, respectively. The digested/hydrolysed samples of carp sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions were separated by RP-HPLC-MS. Amino acid sequences were identified with the use of the LC-MS/MS method coupled with in silico systematic screening for ACEi peptides. ACEi peptides with IVY, IY, VY, ALPHA and VKAGF sequences were found in the carp digests/hydrolysates. In the ex vivo carp digest, an ACEi peptide TVY was also detected, while the ACEi peptide IW was identified in in vitro hydrolysate. Our study showed that different ACEi effects of carp digests and hydrolysates were generated with the use of human gastrointestinal and porcine enzymes.", 
    "1272": "The present study investigated the effect of the Cystoseira crinita sulfated polysaccharide (CCSP) on key enzymes activities related to diabetes in vitro and in diabetic rats. We found that CCSP inhibited pancreatic \u03b1-amylase with IC50 = 39.16\u2009\u03bcg/ml and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) activity with IC50\u2009=\u200958.35\u2009\u03bcg/ml in vitro. In diabetic rats, the administration of CCSP reduced the activity of \u03b1-amylase in serum, pancreas, and intestine by 23%, 44.38%, and 45%, respectively as compared to untreated diabetic rats. Moreover, the administration of CCSP to surviving diabetic rats protects pancreas \u03b2 cells from death and damage, which leads to insulin levels. The decrease in \u03b1-amylase and the increase in insulin level lead to a decrease in glucose rate by 56% as compared to untreated diabetic rats. The inhibitory action of \u03b1-amylase activity and hypoglycemic effect of CCSP were confirmed by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). In addition, the administration of CCSP to surviving diabetic rats normalizes lipid profile, stimulates antioxidant capacity, and prevents liver-kidney toxicities, evidenced by decrease in serum indices of liver and kidney toxicity and confirmed by histological analysis. The overall findings presented in this study demonstrate that the administration of CCSP to diabetic rats can make it a potentially strong candidate for industrial application as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and liver-kidney dysfunctions.", 
    "1273": "Chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy is one of the major possible hazards that can result from potential cardiotoxic agents while treating cancer. Prognostic risk factors include the rate of drug administration, history of hypertension, female gender, extremes of age, previous history of mediastinal irradiation, cumulative dose and pre-existing heart disease. Close monitoring of the patients, timely diagnosis, use of well-known biomarkers including cardiac troponins, NT-ProBNP and imaging studies like 2D Echo or cardiac MRI are essential. Emerging biomarkers include carbonyl reductases (CBR1 and CBR3), aldo-keto reductases (AKR, type 1A1, 1C3, 7A2) and topoisomerase2\u03b2 (Top2\u03b2). \u03b2 blockers and ACE inhibitors have not only been shown to slow down the progression of cardiac dysfunction but also produce symptomatic improvement. Our case report describes a patient with acute myeloblastic leukaemia who developed severe cardiomyopathy acutely after starting the anthracycline-based regimen. Nevertheless, with timely intervention her symptoms improved and subsequently she successfully received allogeneic stem cell transplantation.", 
    "1274": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is common condition in neurosurgical field. It is difficult to select the treatment modality between the surgical method and the conservative method when patients have no or mild symptoms. The purpose of this study is to provide a suggestion that the patients could be cured with conservative treatment modality.", 
    "1275": "We enrolled 16 patients who had received conservative treatment for cSDH without special medications which could affect hematoma resolution such as mannitol, steroids, tranexamic acid and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The patients were classified according to the Markwalder's Grading Scale.", 
    "1276": "Among these 16 patients, 13 (81.3%) patients showed spontaneously resolved cSDH and 3 (18.7%) patients received surgery due to symptom aggravation and growing hematoma. They were categorized into two groups based on whether they were cured with conservative treatment or not. The first group was the spontaneous resolution group. The second group was the progression-surgery group. The mean hematoma volume in the spontaneous resolution group was 43.1 mL. The mean degree of midline shift in the spontaneous resolution group was 5.3 mm. The mean hematoma volume in the progression-surgery group was 62.0 mL. The mean degree of midline shift in the second group was 6 mm.", 
    "1277": "We suggest that the treatment modality should be determined according to the patient's symptoms and clinical condition and close observation could be performed in patients who do not have any symptoms or in patients who have mild to moderate headache without neurological deterioration.", 
    "1278": "Patients with dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus (BE) have a considerable risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The mucosal expression of the pro-inflammatory angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) is elevated in these patients, suggesting a role in carcinogenesis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether interference with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) would influence downstream markers of carcinogenesis.", 
    "1279": "Endoscopic mucosal biopsies from BE patients with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) were sampled before and after a three-week period of RAS-interfering treatment. Thirty patients were randomly allocated to enalapril (ACE inhibitor, 5\u2009mg od), candesartan (AT1R antagonist, 8\u2009mg od), or no drug. The expression of 12 proteins known to be associated with RAS and carcinogenesis was assessed using western blot.", 
    "1280": "We found altered expression of several proteins after enalapril treatment (decreased: NF\u03baB, p\u2009=\u2009.043; NLRP3, p\u2009=\u2009.050; AMACR, p\u2009=\u2009.017; and caspase 3, p\u2009=\u2009.025; increased: p53, p\u2009=\u2009.050). Candesartan treatment was associated with increased iNOS expression (p\u2009=\u2009.033). No significant changes were seen in the no-drug group.", 
    "1281": "Interference with angiotensin II formation was associated with altered expression of inflammation- and carcinogenesis-related proteins. The present results speak in favor of involvement of angiotensin II in BE dysplasia, but the role of AT1R should be investigated further.", 
    "1282": "The increase in angiotensin II (Ang II) formation by selected antihypertensive drugs is said to exhibit neuroprotective properties, but this translation into improvement in clinical outcomes has been inconclusive. We undertook a study to investigate the relationship between types of antihypertensive drugs used prior to a stroke event and ischemic stroke severity. We hypothesized that use of antihypertensive drugs that increase Ang II formation (Ang II increasers) would reduce ischemic stroke severity when compared to antihypertensive drugs that suppress Ang II formation (Ang II suppressors).", 
    "1283": "From the Malaysian National Neurology Registry, we included hypertensive patients with first ischemic stroke who presented within 48 hours from ictus. Antihypertensive drugs were divided into Ang II increasers (angiotensin-I receptor blockers (ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics) and Ang II suppressors (angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and beta blockers). We evaluated stroke severity during admission with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). We performed a multivariable logistic regression with the score being dichotomized at 15. Scores of less than 15 were categorized as less severe stroke.", 
    "1284": "A total of 710 patients were included. ACEIs was the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drug in patients using Ang II suppressors (74%) and CCBs, in patients prescribed with Ang II increasers at 77%. There was no significant difference in the severity of ischemic stroke between patients who were using Ang II increasers in comparison to patients with Ang II suppressors (OR: 1.32, 95%CI: 0.83-2.10, p = 0.24).", 
    "1285": "In our study, we found that use of antihypertensive drugs that increase Ang II formation was not associated with less severe ischemic stroke as compared to use of antihypertensive drugs that suppress Ang II formation."
