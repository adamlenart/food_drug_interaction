    "9": "Evidence has been accrued recently that chronic high levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) can be directly beneficial to the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disorders thus making the substance a promising new therapeutic target. A therapeutic target can be theoretically each stage in the process of generation and elimination of asymmetric dimethylarginine. The methylation of L-arginine residues is a universal biological process involving hundreds of proteins but still with unknown effects. Interference with these mechanisms can generate ambiguous and speculative discussions. Supplementation with L-arginine seems to be the most natural way to reverse the detrimental effect of ADMA on the endothelium. The enzymatic activity of endogenous nitric oxide synthase is regulated by the ratio between the concentrations of L-arginine (the natural substrate) and that of ADMA (the endogenous inhibitor): in the presence of normal L-arginine levels, any elevation ofADMA levels may cause relative L-arginine deficiency thus attenuating the activity of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase. Target replacement therapy with L-arginine to increase the L-arginine plasma levels results in the normalisation of the L-arginine/ADMA ratio in the presence of higher levels of the latter. There is still some controversy about the effects of the most frequently used drugs on asymmetric dimethylarginine. Most of the relevant studies show that statins do not affect the ADMA levels. On the other hand, patients with high levels of ADMA are resistant to statin therapy--to improve the endothelium-dependent vasodilation they need a combined therapy with L-arginine. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor blockers are the most extensively studied substances, the studies predominantly centring on confirming their ADMA reducing effect. Until the specific ADMA-reducing therapy becomes readily available, it is the therapies of modification of the risk factors causing the increase of ADMA or the depletion of L-arginine, and the L-arginine replacement therapy that are the most realistic therapeutic solutions for patients with high plasma levels of ADMA because the synthesis of nitric oxide correlates with the L-arginine/ADMA ratio. A study was conducted in the Surgery of Preventive Cardiology with the Clinic of Cardiology in Plovdiv which included 40 patients with pronounced hypercholesterolemia (HC)--it was found that a one-month therapy with 40 mg simvastatin did not change statistically significantly ADMA plasma levels in spite of the optimal lipid regulation.",

Treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) ameliorates kidney disease in these models. The data of the role of hyperlipidemia in progression of human kidney disease are less clear. Data from small studies in glomerular disease suggest that statins decrease proteinuria. Data mainly from cardiovascular studies suggest that statins decrease the loss of glomerular filtration. The benefit of statins may derive from their lipid lowering effects. More recently, data suggest that the benefit of statins is greater than lipid lowering alone. The pleiotropic effects of statins may derive from inhibition of other downstream targets (isoprenoids) of the mevalonic acid pathway that are separate from cholesterol synthesis. Statins inhibits isoprenylation of Ras and Rho GTPases. These effects may lead to decreased monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the glomerulus, decreased mesangial proliferation and decreased accumulation of extracellular matrix and fibrosis. In addition, inhibition of RhoA and Ras may decrease inflammation and increase eNOS activity. These effects could lead to improvement in the progression of kidney disease.",

In many cases, at neither extreme, there remains a genuine choice of therapy, and for those patients, antiarrhythmic strategies would be preferred if effective and safe antiarrhythmic medications were available. Many new antiarrhythmic agents exploiting new mechanisms of action or novel combinations of established antiarrhythmic activity are currently being investigated. Agents which selectively inhibit ion channels specifically involved in atrial repolarization, so-called atrial repolarization delaying agents, are widely acknowledged as potentially ideal antiarrhythmic treatments, as they will probably be both effective and safe, at the very least (free of pro-arrhythmic effects at the ventricular level). Modified analogues of traditional antiarrhythmic drugs with different combinations of ion channel and receptor blocking effects, novel mechanisms of action, and less complicated metabolic profiles are also under development. Completely innovative antiarrhythmic agents with new antiarrhythmic mechanisms, such as stretch receptor antagonism, sodium calcium exchanger blockade, late sodium channel inhibition, and gap junction modulation are also being explored. In addition, there is increasing evidence in support of the antiarrhythmic action of non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Treatments with statins, omega-3 fatty acids, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, and aldosterone antagonists are all potentially valuable, over and above any effect related to the treatment of underlying heart disease.",

Patients were considered persistent if, at the time of the survey, they continued to take study medication that had been prescribed at discharge. Persistence with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and beta-blockers was also assessed to determine whether changes in statin persistence were unique to the class or related to other medication issues that affected all classes.

The total phenolics content ranged from 966 to 1571 microg of gallic acid/g of fruit fresh weight for Toyonoka and Dover, respectively. No correlation was found between total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The major phenolic compounds in aqueous extracts of strawberries were ellagic acid, quercetin, and chlorogenic acid. Strawberries had high alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. However, alpha-amylase inhibitory activity was very low in all cultivars. This suggested that strawberries could be considered as a potential dietary source with anti-hyperglycemic potential. The evaluated cultivars had no significant ACE inhibitory activity, reflecting low anti-hypertensive potential.",

Its hydrolysate digested with protease SM98011 has been previously shown to have high angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity (He et al., J Pept Sci 12:726-733, 2006). In this article, A. chinensis were fermented by Lactobacillus fermentum SM 605 and the fermented sauce presented high ACE inhibitory activity. The minimum IC(50) value (3.37 +/- 0.04 mg/mL) was achieved by response surface methodology with optimized process parameters such as fermentation time of 24.19 h, incubation temperature at 38.10 degrees C, and pH 6.12. Three ACE inhibitory peptides are purified by ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Identified by mass spectrometry, their amino acid sequences are Asp-Pro, Gly-Thr-Gly, and Ser-Thr, with IC(50) values of 2.15 +/- 0.02, 5.54 +/- 0.09, and 4.03 +/- 0.10 microM, respectively.

    "76": "Cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, primarily arterial hypertension, modify the structural and functional features of the myocardium and the blood vessels, a process known as CV remodeling. Cardiac remodeling refers to changes in left ventricular (LV) geometry, such as concentric LV geometry and LV hypertrophy (LVH), an independent hallmark of CV risk. Vascular remodeling consists of structural changes of the arterial walls, such as increased intima-media thickness, arterial stiffening, and deteriorating endothelial function. CV remodeling is to a large extent a result of compensatory mechanisms, and its pathophysiology is partially mediated by the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and its primary effector peptide angiotensin II, which together play a key role in the progression of CV disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, a class of drugs used in the treatment of arterial hypertension, appear to be effective in controlling or even reversing CV remodeling, independently of simple blood pressure reduction. Evidence shows that ACE inhibitors counteract CV remodeling by reducing LV mass and regressing LVH, attenuating vascular atherosclerosis and improving vascular compliance. ACE inhibitors possessing a sulfhydryl moiety appear to have additional benefits in increasing nitric-oxide release and improving vascular endothelial function.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether a fixed-dose ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination would reduce ambulatory blood pressures (BP) and arterial stiffness in isolated systolic hypertension more than antihypertensive monotherapy. In this randomized, double-blind study, 8 weeks of fosinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination (10/12.5 mg titrated up to 20/12.5 mg) was compared with the calcium channel blocker (amlodipine, 5 mg titrated up to 10 mg) and diuretic (indapamide, 2.5 mg) monotherapy in 28 patients with isolated systolic hypertension. Each patient received all 3 therapies. Assessments included 24-hour ambulatory BP, clinic BP, and applanation tonometry-derived augmentation index. At 8 weeks, the fall in average 24-hour systolic BP and night time systolic BP were significantly greater in the fosinopril-hydrochlorothiazide group, compared to amlodipine and indapamide. The decrease in augmentation index and central aortic systolic BP was also greater in the fosinopril-hydrochlorothiazide group, compared to either amlodipine or indapamide. There was no difference between therapies in decrease in clinic systolic or diastolic BP, or diastolic ABP (average 24-h, diurnal, or nocturnal). Compared with either calcium channel blocker or diuretic therapy, a fixed-dose ACE inhibitor-diuretic combination induces greater reductions in systolic ABP, particularly at night, favorable effects that may be related to a decrease in the intensity of or delay in arterial wave reflections. ACE inhibitor-diuretic combination therapy is a useful approach to cardiovascular risk reduction in isolated systolic hypertension.",

This review discusses several approaches to guide angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibition therapy to more specific groups of patients that are most likely to benefit.",

Lung ANG II levels were positively correlated with plasma PAI-1. Representative lung tissue of the HVZP + CAP group showed mild inflammatory cell infiltration and less hemorrhage and fibrin deposition than did the HVZP group.

In addition, regional cerebral blood flow responses during memory processing are blunted in parietal and thalamic areas among untreated hypertensive adults, who, compared with normotensive subjects, manifest greater correlation in blood flow response across task-related brain regions. Here, we test whether pharmacological treatment of hypertension normalizes regional cerebral blood flow responses and whether it does so differentially according to drug class. Treatment with lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme blocker, known to enhance vasodilative responsivity, was compared with treatment with atenolol, a beta-blocker. Untreated hypertensive volunteers (n=28) were randomly assigned and treated for 1 year. Whole brain and regional cerebral flow responses to memory processing and acutely administered acetazolamide, a vasodilator, were assessed pretreatment and posttreatment. Peripheral brachial artery dilation during reactive hyperemia was also measured. Quantitative blood flow measures showed no difference in the magnitude of regional cerebral blood flow responses pretreatment and posttreatment to either memory tasks or acetazolamide injection. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation increased with treatment. No differences between medications were observed. In brain regions active in memory processing, however, regional cerebral blood flow responses were more highly correlated after treatment. Specificity of cerebral blood flow to different regions appears to decline with treatment of hypertension. This greater correlation among active brain regions, which is present as well in untreated hypertensive relative to normotensive volunteers, may represent compensation in the face of less region-specific responsivity in individuals with hypertension.",

    "96": "A key step in endothelin-1 (ET-1) synthesis is the proteolytic cleavage of big ET-1 by the endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1). Four alternatively spliced isoforms, ECE-1a to ECE-1d, have been discovered; however, regulation of the expression of specific ECE-1 isoforms is not well understood. Therefore, we stimulated primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with angiotensin II (Ang II). Furthermore, expression of ECE-1 isoforms was determined in internal mammary arteries of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Patients had received one of 4 therapies: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and a control group that had received neither ACE-I, ARB (that is, treatment not interfering in the renin-angiotensin system), nor statins. Under control conditions, ECE-1a is the dominant isoform in HUVECs (4.5+/-2.8 amol/microg RNA), followed by ECE-1c (2.7+/-1.0 amol/microg), ECE-1d (0.49+/-0.17 amol/microg), and ECE-1b (0.17+/-0.04 amol/microg). Stimulation with Ang II did not change the ECE-1 expression pattern or the ET-1 release. We found that ECE-1 mRNA expression was higher in patients treated with statins than in patients treated with ARB therapy (5.8+/-0.76 RU versus 3.0+/-0.4 RU), mainly attributed to ECE-1a. In addition, ECE-1a mRNA expression was higher in patients receiving ACE-I therapy than in patients receiving ARB therapy (1.68+/-0.27 RU versus 0.83+/-0.07 RU). We conclude that ECE-1a is the major ECE-1 isoform in primary human endothelial cells. Its expression in internal mammary arteries can be regulated by statin therapy and differs between patients with ACE-I and ARB therapy.", 
    "97": "By 2050, atrial fibrillation (AF) will be present in 2% of the general population and in a far higher proportion of elderly patients. Currently, we are content with rate control and anticoagulation in elderly asymptomatic patients, whereas in younger patients with symptomatic recurrent AF, pulmonary vein isolation is the treatment of choice. However, in a large number of patients, there remains a genuine choice between anti-arrhythmic therapy to suppress the arrhythmia and rate control to control the ventricular rate. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the buoyant development of new anti-arrhythmic agents, exploring new mechanisms of action or novel combinations of established anti-arrhythmic activity. An attractive prospect for AF therapy is the introduction of agents with selective affinity to ion channels specifically involved in atrial repolarization, so-called atrial repolarization-delaying agents. Presently, there are several potential anti-arrhythmic drugs with this mode of action, which are currently in pre-clinical and clinical development. Vernakalant is in the most advanced phase of investigation and its intravenous formulation has recently been recommended for approval for pharmacological cardioversion of AF. However, although this agent has some electrophysiological effects which are specific to the atria, it has others which affect both the atria and the ventricles. Other drugs, such as XEND0101, block a single atrial-specific membrane current. The success of such agents depends critically on their atrial electrophysiological selectivity, freedom from cardiac adverse effects, and general safety. Other possibilities include modified analogues of traditional anti-arrhythmic drugs with additional novel mechanisms of action and less complex metabolic profiles. Dronedarone is an investigational agent with multiple electrophysiological effects, which is devoid of iodine substituents and is believed to have a better side effect profile than its predecessor amiodarone. The development portfolio of dronedarone is practically complete and approval for several indications in AF may soon be assessed. Innovative anti-arrhythmic agents with unconventional anti-arrhythmic mechanisms, such as stretch receptor antagonism, sodium-calcium exchanger blockade, late sodium channel inhibition, and gap junction modulation, have not yet reached clinical studies in AF. Gene- and cell-based therapies, which can selectively target individual currents, could provide ideal one-time only curative therapy for arrhythmias, and the first proof-of-concept studies have been reported. There is accumulating evidence in support of the anti-arrhythmic effects of non-anti-arrhythmic drugs. Treatments with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, statins, and omega-3 fatty acids all seem promising, over and above any effect related to the treatment of underlying heart disease. However, despite exciting results from animal experiments and promising outcomes from retrospective analyses, there is no robust evidence of specific effects of these drugs to transform current clinical practice.", 
    "98": "Various methods are available to formulate water soluble drugs into sustained release dosage forms by retarding the dissolution rate. One of the methods used to control drug release and thereby prolong therapeutic activity is to use hydrophilic and lipophilic polymers. In this study, the effects of various polymers such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC), ethylcellulose (EC) and sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and surfactants (sodium lauryl sulphate, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and Arlacel 60) on the release rate of captopril were investigated. The results showed that an increase in the amount of HPMC K15M resulted in reduction of the release rate of captopril from these matrices. When HPMC was partly replaced by NaCMC (the ratio of HPMC/NaCMC was 5:1), the release rate of the drug significantly decreased. However, there was no significant difference in release rate of captopril from matrices produced with ratios of 5:1 and 2:1 of HPMC/NaCMC. The presence of lactose in matrices containing HPMC and NaCMC increased the release rate of captopril. It was interesting to note that although partial replacement of HPMC by EC reduced the release rate of the drug (ratio of HPMC/EC 2:1), the release rate was increased when the ratio of HPMC/EC was reduced to 1:1. The effects of various surfactants on the release rate of captopril from HPMC/EC (1:1) matrices were also investigated. The results showed that the surfactants did not significantly change the release rate of the drug. Release data were examined kinetically and the ideal kinetic models were estimated for the drug release. The kinetic analysis of drug release data from various formulations showed that incorporation of surfactants in HPMC/EC matrices did not produce a zero-order release pattern.",

    "106": "Trypanosoma cruzi trypomastigotes rely on the structural diversity of the cruzipain family of cysteine proteases to infect and multiply in nonprofessional phagocytic cells. Herein, we will review studies demonstrating that the interplay of cruzipain with peptidase inhibitors modulate infection outcome in a variety of experimental settings. Studies with a panel of T. cruzi strains showed that parasite ability to invade human smooth muscle cells is influenced by the balance between cruzipain and chagasin, a tight binding endogenous inhibitor of papain-like cysteine proteases. Analysis of T. cruzi interaction with endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes indicated that parasite-induced activation of bradykinin receptors drive host cell invasion by [Ca2+]I-dependent pathways. Clues about the mechanisms underlying kinin generation in vivo by trypomastigotes came from analysis of the dynamics of edematogenic inflammation. Owing to plasma extravasation, the blood-borne kininogens accumulate in peripheral sites of infection. Upon diffusion in peripheral tissues, kininogens (i.e., type III cystatins) bind to heparan sulphate chains, thus constraining interactions of the cystatin-like inhibitory domains with cruzipain. The cell bound kininogens are then turned into facile substrates for cruzipain, which liberates kinins in peripheral tissues. Subjected to tight-regulation by kinin-degrading metallopeptidases, such as angiotensin converting enzyme, the short-lived kinin peptides play a dual role in the host-parasite balance. Rather than unilaterally stimulating pathogen infectivity via bradykinin receptors, the released kinins potently induce dendritic cell maturation, thus stimulating type 1 immune responses. In conclusion, the studies reviewed herein illustrate how regulation of parasite proteases may affect host-parasite equilibrium in the course of IT cruzi infection.",

In the former case, angioedema can be caused by allergic reactions caused by immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated hypersensitivity to foods or drugs that can also result in acute urticaria or a more generalized anaphylactic reaction. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitors, in particular) may cause angioedema with or without urticaria, and leukotrienes may have a particular role as a mediator of the swelling. Reactions to contrast agents resemble allergy with basophil and mast cell degranulation in the absence of specific IgE antibody and can be generalized, that is, anaphylactoid. Angioedema accompanies chronic urticaria in 40% of patients, and approximately half have an autoimmune mechanism in which there is IgG antibody directed to the subunit of the IgE receptor (40%) or to IgE itself (5%-10%). Bradykinin is the mediator of angioedema in hereditary angioedema types I and II (C1 inhibitor [INH] deficiency) and the newly described type III disorder some of which are caused bya mutation involving factor XII. Acquired C1 INH deficiency presents in a similar fashion to the hereditary disorder and is due either toC1 INH depletion by circulating immune complexes or to an IgG antibody directed to C1 INH. Although each of these causes excessive bradykinin formation because of activation of the plasma bradykinin-forming pathway, the angioedema due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is caused by excessive bradykinin levels due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. Idiopathic angioedema (ie, pathogenesis unknown) may be histaminergic, that is, caused by mast cell degranulation with histamine release, or nonhistaminergic. The mediator pathways in the latter case are yet to be defined. A minority may be associated with the same autoantibodies associated with chronic urticaria. Angioedema that is likely to be life threatening (laryngeal edema or tongue/pharyngeal edema that obstructs the airway) is seen in anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions and the disorders mediated by bradykinin.",

    "121": "Aminopeptidases metabolize angiotensin II to angiotensin-(2-8) (=angiotensin III) and angiotensin-(3-8) (=angiotensin IV), and carboxypeptidases generate angiotensin-(1-7) from angiotensin I and II. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor blockers affect the concentrations of these metabolites, and they may thus contribute to the beneficial effects of these drugs, possibly through stimulation of non-classical angiotensin AT receptors. Here, we investigated the effects of angiotensin II, angiotensin III, angiotensin IV and angiotensin-(1-7) in the rat coronary vascular bed, with or without angiotensin AT1 - or angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor blockade. Results were compared to those in rat iliac arteries and abdominal aortas. Angiotensin II, angiotensin III and angiotensin IV constricted coronary arteries via angiotensin AT1 receptor stimulation, angiotensin III and angiotensin IV being approximately 20- and approximately 8000-fold less potent than angiotensin II. The angiotensin AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 greatly enhanced the constrictor effects of angiotensin III, starting at angiotensin III concentrations in the low nanomolar range. PD123319 enhanced the angiotensin II-induced constriction at submicromolar angiotensin II concentrations only. Angiotensin-(1-7) exerted no effects in the coronary circulation, although, at micromolar concentrations, it blocked angiotensin AT1 receptor-induced constriction. Angiotensin AT2 receptor-mediated relaxation did not occur in iliac arteries and abdominal aortas, and the constrictor effects of the angiotensin metabolites in these vessels were identical to those in the coronary vascular bed. In conclusion, angiotensin AT2 receptor activation in the rat coronary vascular bed results in vasodilation, and angiotensin III rather than angiotensin II is the preferred endogenous agonist of these receptors. Angiotensin II, angiotensin III, angiotensin IV and angiotensin-(1-7) do not exert effects through non-classical angiotensin AT receptors in the rat coronary vascular bed, iliac artery or aorta.", 
    "122": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a crucial role in blood pressure regulation and hypertension-related complications. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) were the first to be used to block the RAAS and now have many compelling indications in the treatment of hypertension and its cardiovascular and renal complications. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), introduced 20 years later, have been shown to be equally as effective as antihypertensive treatment and are also associated with a lower number of side effects. Furthermore, in clinical trials ARBs and ACEIs were associated with comparable benefits for their most typical indications. This was confirmed in the 2007 New European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC) guidelines for the management of hypertension by comparable specific recommendations for ARB and ACEI treatment. There is sufficient theoretical background and, in some cases, also clinical evidence that combination therapy with ACEIs and ARBs may be more beneficial than monotherapy with either of the groups alone, both in uncomplicated hypertension and with concomitant heart failure or renal dysfunction. However, the combination of ACEI and ARB was not recommended in the ESH/ESC 2007 Guidelines. This may change after the publication of the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global End point Trial (ONTARGET) study, the preliminary results of which have just been presented. In heart failure, recent studies have shown that the combination of ACEI and ARB decreases cardiovascular mortality and the number of hospitalizations due to aggravation of heart failure. These results have been reflected in the newest ESC guidelines of the heart failure treatment. Nephroprotective properties of the combination of ACEs and ARBs have been proved both in studies on nondiabetic and diabetic nephropathy.

Volume and pressure overload on a ''normal myocardium'' is the classical physiological pattern while myocardial contractile dysfunction of different etiology is much less observed in the pediatric population. However there are some peculiarities in clinical presentation of heart failure in infants and small children. The medical therapy cornerstones still remain loop diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and digitalis. There are also some reported experiences with new inotropics drugs in acute heart failure. In pediatric cardiology there are few prospective studies on pharmacology of heart failure and the data are often extrapolated from adult large trials. Non pharmacological treatment with autonomic implantable cardioverter defibrillators and resynchronization therapy as well as the surgically implant of ventricular assist devices are increasingly employed in children.

In this article, we propose that fibrotic islet destruction might be one of the important pathogenic mechanisms of the limited capacity of beta-cell proliferation and accelerated apoptosis in diabetic patients. We have found that pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) are involved in the progression of islet fibrosis in type 2 diabetes. High concentrations of glucose and insulin in islets contribute to PSC activation and proliferation through angiotensin II type 2 (ATII) signaling pathway, although the exact mechanisms remain to be confirmed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors attenuate fibrotic islet destructions and that these have some beneficial effects on glucose tolerance. We suggest that PSCs might play a major role for the fibrotic islet destruction in patients with type 2 diabetes, and suppression of PSCs activation and proliferation might be one of the reasonable target to prevent and delay the progression of the type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "129": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) play a pivotal role in the progression of renal disease. The RAAS has become much more complex in recent years with the identification of novel peptides that exhibit biological activity. There are novel pathways of angiotensin II (ANG II) generation independent of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). ANG II bind to at least two different receptors and prorenin/renin also exerts pathophysiological effects through binding to specific receptor. ANG II itself has emerged as a multifunctional cytokine exhibiting many non-hemodynamic properties such as acting as a growth factor and profibrogenic and proinflammatory cytokine. These profibrogenic and proinflammatory effects are mediated by other factors such as transforming growth-factor beta (TGF-beta) and chemoattractants that are induced in the kidney by ANG II. Increased aldosterone levels contribute to renal injury, independent of blood pressure or ANG II. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have shown that ACE-inhibitors as well as AT1-receptor antagonists can prevent glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. This review will highlight some of these novel insights into the RAAS in regards to renal injury.",

The following parameters were measured: echocardiographic, hemodynamic and hemorheological changes, angiogenesis, infarct size and cardiac remodeling and the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF). Rats treated with SalB or benazepril manifested the following: (1) marked improvements in echocardiographic, hemodynamic and hemorheological parameters; (2) significant reduction of infarct size; (3) significantly attenuated heart, kidney and lung hypertrophies, left ventricular (LV) dilatation and fibrosis. The unique effects of SalB were angiogenesis and augmented VEGF expression in the border and remote noninfarcted left ventricular area. These results suggest that both SalB and benazepril exerted beneficial cardioprotective effects in our experimental system, but that the modality of Sal B was different from that of benazepril.

The brain possesses a local angiotensin system, and OS and inflammation are key factors in the progression of Parkinson's disease. In rat mesencephalic cultures, AII increased 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic (DA) cell death, generation of superoxide in DA neurons and microglial cells, the expression of NADPH-oxidase mRNA, and the number of reactive microglial cells. These effects were blocked by AII type-1 (AT1) antagonists, NADPH inhibitors, or elimination of glial cells. DA degeneration increased angiotensin converting enzyme activity and AII levels. In rats, 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic cell loss and microglial activation were reduced by treatment with AT1 antagonists.

In a simple correlation analysis, AI showed a positive association with age, and a negative association with body height, body weight, waist circumference, heart rate (HR), plasma glucose, and HbA1c. Women had significantly higher AI than men. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that mean BP (MBP) (beta=0.260, p<0.001), HR (beta=-0.550, p<0.001) and body height (beta=-0.217, p<0.001) were independent determinants of radial AI. Similarly, the second peak of systolic BP (SBP2), an index of central aortic systolic BP (SBP), showed a positive association with age, BMI, waist circumference, MBP and AI, and a negative association with body height. In a separate analysis performed in diabetic patients with treated hypertension (n=123), again, only MBP, HR and body height were significant determinants of radial AI. There was no difference in radial AI and SBP2 among the classes of antihypertensive drugs used. These findings indicate that tight BP control would be effective in reducing the reflection wave and aortic BP, which could independently relate to cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetic patients.", 
    "160": "We evaluated our present treatment of hypertension and sought a way to improve it. We studied 164 of outpatients we treated in 2002. Mean systolic blood pressure (SBP)+/-SD was 142.0+/-11.3, and 56% of patients had SBP over 140 mmHg. We used more diuretics in patients with good control of SBP (19% vs. 7% of patients; p=0.012). After observing our hypertensive patients, we changed our treatment in a goal-oriented manner. Our goal was blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. We used, in principle, additional small amounts of diuretics for inadequately treated patients. We followed 147 of the 164 patients from 2002 to 2006. During this period, mean SBP decreased to 134.7+/-9.1 mmHg (p<0.001), and the frequency of patients with SBP>140 mmHg decreased to 14% (p<0.001). We used more diuretics in 2006 than in 2002 (12% to 46% p<0.001). To estimate the risks and benefits of diuretics, in 2006 we analyzed 510 patients who had been followed for at least 2 years. Potassium supplementation was needed in 28% of diuretic-treated patients and 7% of patients without diuretics. We found a correlation between the use of diuretics and good SBP control in the entire patient group as well as in patients with diabetes. In the control of diabetes mellitus, we found no statistical difference between patients treated with diuretics and those not. We found diuretics had no adverse effects with respect to new-onset diabetes mellitus.", 
    "161": "Dyslipidemia complicates renal function leading to disturbances of major homeostatic organs in the body. Here we examined the effect of chronic renal dysfunction induced by uninephrectomy on fat redistribution and lipid peroxidation in rats treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril) for up to 10 months. Uninephrectomized rats developed fat redistribution and hypercholesterolemia typical of chronic renal failure when compared with sham-operated rats or lisinopril-treated uninephrectomized rats. The weight of the peri-renal fat was significantly less in the untreated compared to the lisinopril-treated uninephrectomized rats or those rats with a sham operation. We also found that there was a shift of heat-protecting unilocular adipocytes to heat-producing multilocular fat cells in the untreated uninephrectomized rats. Similarly in these rats we found a shift of subcutaneous and visceral fat to ectopic fat with excessive lipid accumulation and lipofuscin pigmentation. Lisinopril treatment prevented fat redistribution or transformation and lipid peroxidation. This study shows that ACE inhibition may prevent the fat anomalies associated with chronic renal dysfunction.",

Accordingly, the purpose of the current study was to analyze the comparative effects of metoprolol and perindopril on aortic elasticity in young patients with prehypertension after 6 months of therapy.", 
    "163": "Fifty newly diagnosed patients with hypertension, who were in the prehypertension category according to the Joint National Committee seventh report, were enrolled in this blind, randomized, prospective study. After baseline clinical assessment, patients were randomly assigned to 4 mg daily dose of perindopril (group I, n=27, 18 male, median age=35 years) or 100 mg daily dose of metoprolol succinate (group II, n=28, 16 male, median age=33 years) for 6 months. Aortic strain, distensibility, and stiffness indexes were calculated from aortic diameters measured by echocardiography and blood pressures simultaneously measured by sphygmomanometry before and after treatment.", 
    "164": "When the median aortic distensibility and strain indexes after 6 months of therapy were analyzed, aortic distensibility and strain indexes of both treatment arms were found to be significantly higher than those of the pretreatment period. In contrast, the posttreatment aortic stiffness indexes of both groups were significantly lower compared with those of pretreatment period. No statistical difference was found between pretreatment and posttreatment aortic elasticity parameters of both groups. Importantly, no statistically significant difference was found between the percentage change from baseline of metoprolol and perindopril groups regarding aortic elasticity parameters (aortic distensibility: 38.1 vs. 37.9%, respectively, P=0.86; aortic strain: 37.7 vs. 37.9%, respectively, P=0.44; stiffness index: -20.0 vs. -23.9%).",

    "166": "This report describes the normalization of left ventricular ejection fraction and resolution of signs and symptoms of chronic and severe heart failure in both male and female patients (mean age 54 years) treated with standard medical therapy. These observations were made in 11 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy treated in a single cardiology practice, who had evidence of myocardial \"viability\" (dysfunctional but noncontractile myocardium that has the potential for improvement in function) as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, low-dose dobutamine echocardiography, or nuclear imaging. These patients were treated with standard available therapies including beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and potassium and non-potassium-sparing diuretics. The average ejection fraction at presentation was 17% +/- 9% which improved to 59% +/- 5%. All patients improved to New York Heart Association functional class I with available therapy. The majority of patients received micronutrient supplementation with coenzyme Q10, vitamin B1, and amino acids, which target the pathways of cardiac metabolism and may aid in the restoration of cardiac function. This case series demonstrates that normalization of cardiac function is possible with standard therapy and the importance of assessing myocardial viability in all patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Given the unique metabolic needs of the failing heart, the role of micronutrients in combination with standard therapy warrants further investigation.", 
    "167": "The brain renin-angiotensin system contributes significantly to progressive left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in rats after myocardial infarction (MI). The present study evaluated the effects of central versus peripheral plus central angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) blockade on sympathetic activity, and LV anatomy and function after MI.",

    "169": "At 24 hours after the last dose, subcutaneous trandolapril caused 70% to 80% ACE inhibition in both brain and kidneys; lisinopril caused 10% to 20% less. Central infusion of lisinopril caused 70% inhibition of brain ACE and minimal (6%) inhibition in the kidneys. All three treatments similarly improved sympathetic reactivity and arterial baroreflex function. All three treatments lowered cardiac Ang I and II, and similarly attenuated the increases in LV end diastolic pressure, circumference, and fibrosis. Both subcutaneous treatments further decreased LV peak systolic pressure and dP/dt max, whereas icv lisinopril caused no change.", 
    "170": "Despite marked differences in the extent of peripheral blockade, all three treatments similarly affected sympathetic activity and decreased cardiac Ang II, preload and remodeling after MI. One may speculate that central and peripheral ACE-mediated mechanisms are sequential and therefore only minor additional effects of peripheral ACE blockade are noted.",

Geraniin, the hydrolysable tannin, was purified by a series of chromatographic processes from the 70% aqueous acetone extracts of P. urinaria and identified by NMR [1H (500 MHz) and 13C NMR (126 MHz)] spectra and mass spectroscopy. The scavenging activities of geraniin against DPPH radicals (half-inhibition concentration, IC50, were 0.92 and 1.27 microM, respectively, for pH 4.5 and pH 7.9), hydroxyl radicals (IC50 was 0.11 microM by deoxyribose method and 1.44 microM by electron spin resonance method), and superoxide radicals (IC50 were 2.65 microM) were determined in comparison with positive controls. The inhibitory activities against xanthine oxidase (IC50 were 30.49 microM) were measured. Geraniin also showed dose-dependent inhibitory activities against semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO, IC50 were 6.58 microM) and against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE, IC50 were 13.22microM). For kinetic property determinations, geraniin showed competitive inhibitions against SSAO (the apparent inhibition constant, Ki, was 0.70microM) and mixed noncompetitive inhibitions against ACE. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 10-week age) were orally administered to once (5 mg geraniin/kg SHR), and changes of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured over 24 h and compared with the positive control of captopril (2 mg/kg SHR). The geraniin showed antihypertensive activity in lowering SBP and DBP and showed a significant difference from the blank (distilled water) at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h. Healthy food products could use geraniin for antioxidant protection and therapeutic effects in the future.", 
    "172": "Hypertension increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. In addition to lowering blood pressure, blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) reduces the risk of new-onset T2DM and offers renal protection. Using a MEDLINE search, we identified multiple trials that reported the incidence of T2DM in patients taking inhibitors of RAAS. In this review, we will discuss the RAAS as a potential target in diabetes prevention and the mechanisms through which inhibitors of this system achieve such an important effect. We will also shed light on the beneficial cardiovascular and renal effects of RAAS blockade. Although multiple studies have demonstrated that inhibitors of RAAS, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, can reduce the incidence of T2DM, randomized controlled studies are still needed to further elucidate their exact role in diabetes prevention.",

This decreased to 63% and 59% at 6 months and 12 months of follow-up respectively, due to a shift from sub-target levels to low dosages. Justified reasons for under-treatment were apparent in only 25% not optimally treated discharged patients and this decreased to 12% and 4% at 6 and 12 months follow-up, respectively. Common reasons for non-treatment at discharge were hyperkalemia and elevation in serum creatinine, while hypotension and cough were more prominent at follow-up. Clinical parameters associated with increased treatment rates were ischemic heart disease and the absence of chronic renal failure. Patients receiving treatment had lower hospitalization and mortality rates.",

However, dairy products contains additional factors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, which may further suppress oxidative and inflammatory stress. Accordingly, this study was designed to study the effects of the short-term (3 wk) basal suboptimal Ca (0.4%), high-Ca (1.2% from CaCO(3)), and high-dairy (1.2% Ca from milk) obesigenic diets on oxidative and inflammatory stress in adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein-agouti transgenic mice. Adipose tissue reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and NADPH oxidase mRNA and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) were reduced by the high-Ca diet (P < 0.001) compared with the basal diet and ROS and MDA were further decreased by the high-dairy diet (P < 0.001). The high-Ca and -dairy diets also resulted in suppression of adipose tissue tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA (P = 0.001) compared with the basal diet, whereas an inverse pattern was noted for adiponectin and IL-15 mRNA (P = 0.002). Consequently, we conducted a follow-up evaluation of adiponectin and C-reactive protein (CRP) in archival samples from 2 previous clinical trials conducted in obese men and women. Twenty-four weeks of feeding a high-dairy eucaloric diet and hypocaloric diet resulted in an 11 (P < 0.03) and 29% (P < 0.01) decrease in CRP, respectively (post-test vs. pre-test), whereas there was no significant change in the low-dairy groups. Adiponectin decreased by 8% in subjects fed the eucaloric high-dairy diet (P = 0.003) and 18% in those fed the hypocaloric high-dairy diet (P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that dietary Ca suppresses adipose tissue oxidative and inflammatory stress.", 
    "179": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin and endothelin (ET) systems prevents the development of obliterative airway disease (OAD) in rat tracheal allografts. In this study, we assessed whether these therapeutic approaches are effective even when the same were started after signs of OAD were already manifest. Rat tracheas were heterotopically transplanted from Brown-Norway donors into Brown-Norway or Lewis recipients. Allograft recipients received bosentan, ramipril, bosentan plus ramipril or vehicle from day 10 to 24. Untreated allografts and isografts were harvested at day 10 or 24. In tracheal grafts, morphometric studies together with molecular analysis by real-time PCR were performed. Fibroproliferative process in untreated tracheal allografts but not in isografts started already at day 10. Neither bosentan nor ramipril treatment alone as monotherapy could modify the development of OAD when administered only between day 10 and day 24. By contrast, the combination treatment of bosentan and ramipril ameliorated airway obstruction by day 24, which was accompanied by reduced mRNA expression of intragraft transforming growth factor-beta1 and platelet-derived growth factor-A and -B chains. Only the combined blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ET receptor antagonists can reduce the progression of OAD in this model if the treatment is initiated late in the disease course.",

    "192": "Transepithelial transport of the ACE inhibitory peptides Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro was studied in different models of absorption. Apparent permeability (P(app)) values for absorptive transport across Caco-2 monolayers were 1.0+/-0.9 x 10(-8) (Ile-Pro-Pro) and 0.5+/-0.1 x 10(-8)cms(-1) (Val-Pro-Pro). Ex vivo transport across jejunal segments in the Ussing chamber was 5-times (Ile-Pro-Pro) to 10-times (Val-Pro-Pro) higher with no significant differences (p>0.05) observed between both peptides. The peptidase inhibitor bestatin increased permeability for the absorptive direction for Ile-Pro-Pro by twofold. Neither a transepithelial pH gradient nor increased apical tripeptide concentration nor longitudinal localization of the intestinal segment influenced P(app) in the ex vivo experiments. Val-Pro-Pro transport across Peyer's patches, however, was 4-times higher (P(app)=21.0+/-9.3 x10(-8)cms(-1)) as compared to duodenum (P(app)=4.8+/-1.4 x 10(-8)cms(-1)). In the in situ perfusion experiments P(app) values varied greatly among different animals ranging from 0.5 to 24.0 x10(-8)cms(-1) (Ile-Pro-Pro) and from 1.0 to 15.6 x 10(-8)cms(-1) (Val-Pro-Pro). In summary, Caco-2 and ex vivo absorption models differ considerably regarding their peptide permeability. The in situ model seems to be less appropriate because of the observed large variability in peptide permeability. The results of this study demonstrate that the ACE inhibitory peptides Ile-Pro-Pro and Val-Pro-Pro are absorbed partially undegraded.",

    "200": "Hypertension is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Lowering blood pressure (BP) may reduce the risk of stroke by 40% and the risk of ischemic heart disease by 20%. Despite the varied drugs available to lower BP, more than 50% of the hypertensive patients are not well-controlled. The major reason for the failure to control BP is noncompliance which is related to the side effects and inconvenience of drug administration. Aliskiren, a new oral direct renin inhibitor is very effective in BP reduction. It is given once daily and has very few side effects, almost like a placebo. It is well combined with diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers. Unlike ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers that block the renin angiotensin axis in its last part and thereby raise the rein-levels, the direct renin inhibitor block the renin-angiotensin axis in its beginning and keep the renin levels suppressed. Aliskiren is a promising agent but further prospective studies with morbidity and mortality data as endpoints are required, before the drug can be recommended as a first choice agent.",

Corneal burn injury was shown to cause a significant increase in the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the tear and internal ocular tissue structures, promoting their microcirculatory disorders and inflammation development. The local use of ACE inhibitors as instillations substantially reduces an inflammatory reaction and the incidence of deep and extensive corneal ulcers. The study performed provides experimental rationale for the local use of ACE inhibitors for the treatment of inflammatory processes in the eye.",

    "212": "Germline activation of H-RAS oncogenes is the primary cause of Costello syndrome (CS), a neuro-cardio-facio-cutaneous developmental syndrome. Here we describe the generation of a mouse model of CS by introduction of an oncogenic Gly12Val mutation in the mouse H-Ras locus using homologous recombination in ES cells. Germline expression of the endogenous H-RasG12V oncogene, even in homozygosis, resulted in hyperplasia of the mammary gland. However, development of tumors in these mice was rare. H-RasG12V mutant mice closely phenocopied some of the abnormalities observed in patients with CS, including facial dysmorphia and cardiomyopathies. These mice also displayed alterations in the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system, including development of systemic hypertension, extensive vascular remodeling, and fibrosis in both the heart and the kidneys. This phenotype was age dependent and was a consequence of the abnormal upregulation of the renin-Ang II system. Treatment with captopril, an inhibitor of Ang II biosynthesis, prevented development of the hypertension condition, vascular remodeling, and heart and kidney fibrosis. In addition, it partially alleviated the observed cardiomyopathies. These mice should help in elucidating the etiology of CS symptoms, identifying additional defects, and evaluating potential therapeutic strategies.",

Two antihypertensive agents were studied: captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. The antitumor activity of cediranib, alone and in combination with nifedipine, was also evaluated in a LoVo human colorectal tumor xenograft model in nude rats. All treatments were given orally.",

Dosing 3 mg/kg/d cediranib for 4 days induced a marked hypertension of 35 to 50 mmHg. Captopril (30 mg/kg, qd) was effective at lowering a 10 mmHg increase in blood pressure but not a 35 to 50 mmHg increase. However, the latter was rapidly reversed by administration of nifedipine (10 mg/kg, bd). Coadministration of nifedipine did not negatively affect the antitumor activity of cediranib (1.5 mg/kg/d).",

To develop probes for imaging ACE expression, a series of di(2-pyridylmethyl)amine (D) chelates capable of binding M(CO)3+ (M = technetium, rhenium) was conjugated to lisinopril by acylation of the epsilon-amine of the lysine residue with a series of di(2-pyridylmethylamino)alkanoic acids where the distance of the chelator from the lisinopril core was investigated by varying the number of methylene spacer groups to produce di(2-pyridylmethyl)amine(Cx)lisinopril analogs: D(C4)lisinopril, D(C5)lisinopril, and D(C8)lisinopril. The inhibitory activity of each rhenium complex was evaluated in vitro against purified rabbit lung ACE and was shown to vary directly with the length of the methylene spacer: Re[D(C8)lisinopril], inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) = 3 nM; Re[D(C5)lisinopril], IC50 = 144 nM; and Re[D(C4)lisinopril], IC50 = 1,146 nM, as compared with lisinopril, IC50 = 4 nM. The in vivo specificity for ACE was determined by examining the biodistribution of the 99mTc-[D(C8)lisinopril] analog in rats with and without pretreatment with unlabeled lisinopril. Uptake in the lungs, a tissue that constitutively expresses ACE, was 15.2 percentage injected dose per gram at 10 min after injection and was dramatically reduced by pretreatment with lisinopril, supporting ACE-mediated binding in vivo. Planar anterior imaging analysis of 99mTc-[D(C8)lisinopril] corroborated these data. Thus, high-affinity 99mTc-labeled ACE inhibitor has been designed with potency similar to that of lisinopril and has been demonstrated to specifically localize to tissues that express ACE in vivo. This agent may be useful in monitoring ACE as a function of disease progression in relevant diseases such as heart failure.",

Gills contained the highest ACELA, then brain, muscle, and testis, respectively, while no activity was detected in the following tissues: hepatopancreas, hindgut, hypodermis, heart, and hemolymph. ACELA present in gill membranes exhibited a K(m) of 0.23 mM and V(max) of 7.6 nmol with synthetic substrate. The enzyme activity was dependent on Cl- concentration and was markedly inhibited by captopril, lisinopril, and EDTA. Addition of Zn2+ to membranes previously treated with EDTA restored 89% activity, suggesting that C. maenas ACELA is a Zn2+ metalloenzyme. Gill membranes prepared from premolt crabs showed similar levels of ACELA to those of the intermolt animals. Administration of captopril in vivo lengthened the half life of circulating CHH, while in vitro incubation of gill membranes with captopril reduced CHH. These results suggest that C. maenas ACELA present in gills is likely to be involved in degradation of this neuropeptide.", 
    "225": "High glucose (HG) increases angiotensin II (AngII) generation in mesangial cells (MC). Chymase, an alternative AngII-generating enzyme, is upregulated in the glomeruli of diabetic kidneys. In this study, we examined AngII synthesis by human MC via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-dependent and chymase-dependent pathways under normal glucose (NG, 5 mM) and HG (30 mM) conditions. NG cells expressed ACE and chymase mRNA. Under NG conditions the chymase inhibitor chymostatin reduced AngII levels in cell lysates and in the culture medium, and the ACE inhibitor captopril had no effect. HG induced a 3-fold increase in chymase mRNA and protein but not in ACE mRNA; however, HG induced a 10-fold increase in intracellular ACE activity. The increase in AngII generation induced by HG was found in the cell lysate but not in the culture medium. The rise in intracellular AngII was not prevented by captopril or by chymostatin. Moreover, captopril inhibited extracellular ACE activity but failed to block intracellular ACE activity; these results suggested that captopril was unable to reach intra-cellular ACE. Losartan did not change the intracellular AngII content in either NG or HG conditions, and this lack of change suggested that the increase in AngII was due to intracellular generation. Together these results suggest that chymase may be active in human MC and that both ACE and chymase are involved in increased AngII generation during the HG stimulus by different mechanisms, including an upregulation of chymase mRNA and a rise in intracellular ACE activity, favoring the generation and accumulation of intracellular AngII.",

About half of the patients who were prescribed an antihypertensive drug had stopped taking it within one year. On any day, patients who were still engaged with the drug dosing regimen omitted about 10% of the scheduled doses: 42% of these omissions were of a single day's dose, whereas 43% were part of a sequence of several days (three or more days-that is, drug \"holidays\").

In the present study, we investigated the effects of soy protein hydrolysate with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory potential on the blood pressure and cardiovascular remodeling in rats with N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME)-induced hypertension. Rats were fed a diet containing L-NAME (50 mg/kg body weight) with or without soy protein hydrolysate (1%, 3% or 5%) for 6 weeks. We found that ingestion of soy protein hydrolysate retarded the development of hypertension during the 6-week experimental period without affecting the amount of food intake. Although there was no difference in plasma ACE activity or tissue nitric oxide levels, ACE activity in the heart of rats consuming soy protein hydrolysate was significantly lower than that of the control group. Moreover, cardiac malonaldehyde and tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentrations were also lower in the soy protein hydrolysate group. No difference in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level was found in plasma or cardiovascular tissue. In the histopathological analysis, we also found that soy protein hydrolysate ameliorated inflammation and left ventricle hypertrophy in the heart. These findings suggest that soy protein hydrolysate might not only improve the balance between circulating nitric oxide and renin-angiotensin system but also show beneficial effects on cardiovascular tissue through its ACE inhibitory activity.",

We examined the association between antihypertensive drug therapy and the risk of NOD in a population-based study. The sample consisted of 8,638 elderly hypertensive patients. The data were obtained from claim forms provided to the central region branch of the Bureau of National Health Insurance in Taiwan from January 2001 to December 2006. Prescriptions for antihypertensive drugs before the index date were retrieved from a prescription database. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) of NOD associated with antihypertensive drug use; nondiabetic subjects served as the reference group. The risk of NOD was higher among users of diuretics (OR, 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.21), and beta-blockers (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.20) than among nonusers.

Despite the lack of uniform definitions, this condition is frequently called vasoplegia or vasoplegic syndrome (VS), and is thought to be due to dysregulation of endothelial homeostasis and subsequent endothelial dysfunction secondary to direct and indirect effects of multiple inflammatory mediators. Vasoplegia has been observed in all age groups and in various clinical settings, such as anaphylaxis (including protamine reaction), sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, hemodialysis, and cardiac surgery. Among mechanisms thought to be contributory to VS, the nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway appears to play a prominent role. In search of effective treatment for vasoplegia, methylene blue (MB), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and guanylate cyclase (GC), has been found to improve the refractory hypotension associated with endothelial dysfunction of VS. There is evidence that MB may indeed be effective in improving systemic hemodynamics in the setting of vasoplegia, with reportedly few side effects. This review describes the current state of clinical and experimental knowledge relating to MB use in the setting of VS, highlighting the potential risks and benefits of therapeutic MB administration in refractory hypotensive states.",

    "259": "Snake venoms are known to be an extensive source of bioactive peptides. Bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs) are inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme that have already been identified in the venom of many snake, scorpion, spider and batrachian species. Their most characteristic structural features are an invariable N-terminal pyroglutamate residue (pGlu or Z) and two consecutive proline residues at the C-terminus. Fragmentation of BPPs by collision-induced dissociation during electrospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis (ESI-MS/MS) generates a predominant signal at m/z 213.1 corresponding to the y-ion of the terminal Pro-Pro fragment. In addition, signals at m/z 226.1 and 240.1 that correspond to the b ions of the N-terminus pGlu-Asn and pGlu-Lys, respectively, can often be observed. Based on these structural determinants, the present work describes an original methodology for the discovery of BPPs in natural extracts using liquid chromatography coupled to ESI-MS/MS operated in precursor ion-scan mode. The venom of the Bothrops moojeni snake was used as a model and the methodology was applied for subsequent structural analysis of the identified precursors by tandem mass spectrometry on quadrupole-time-of-flight (Q-TOF) and matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) instruments. More than 40 peptides below 2500 Da could be detected, among them 20 were shown to belong to the BPP-like family including the related tripeptides pGlu-Lys-Trp and pGlu-Asn-Trp. A total of 15 new sequences have been identified using this approach.",

Mean follow-up was 3.7 years (range 4 months to 6.7 years). Mean age was 93 years, 34% were men, and 60% were Caucasian. Common co-morbidities included hypertension (67%), dyslipidemia (28%), atrial fibrillation (28%), renal insufficiency (27%), dementia (23%), and previous cerebrovascular events (22%). Mean peak troponin was 20 mug/L (range 1.5 to 183 microg/L). Cardiac catheterization was performed within 48 hours in 42 patients (24%) and after 48 hours in 14 patients (8%); 40 patients (23%) received an intervention. Hospital mortality was 15% (n = 27). Survival at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year were 78%, 69%, and 47%. Independent predictors of shorter survival time by Cox analysis included body mass index <25 kg/m2 (p <0.001), creatinine > or =2.0 mg/dl (p = 0.001), hemoglobin <11.0 g/dl (p = 0.016), and dementia (p = 0.027). Patients receiving aspirin, clopidogrel, beta blockers, and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors appeared to have a lower mortality. In conclusion, AMI in nonagenarians is associated with high mortality, with over 50% of patients dying within one year of presentation; elevated creatinine and lower hemoglobin are strong predictors of adverse prognosis, and lower body mass index and the presence of dementia add independent prognostic significance.", 
    "261": "The recently introduced non-stochastic and stochastic bond-based linear indices are been generalized to codify chemical structure information for chiral drugs, making use of a trigonometric 3D-chirality correction factor. These improved modified descriptors are applied to several well-known data sets to validate each one of them. Particularly, Cramer's steroid data set has become a benchmark for the assessment of novel quantitative structure activity relationship methods. This data set has been used by several researchers using 3D-QSAR approaches such as Comparative Molecular Field Analysis, Molecular Quantum Similarity Measures, Comparative Molecular Moment Analysis, E-state, Mapping Property Distributions of Molecular Surfaces, and so on. For that reason, it is selected by us for the sake of comparability. In addition, to evaluate the effectiveness of this novel approach in drug design we model the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of perindoprilate's sigma-stereoisomers combinatorial library, as well as codify information related to a pharmacological property highly dependent on the molecular symmetry of a set of seven pairs of chiral N-alkylated 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-piperidines that bind sigma-receptors. The validation of this method is achieved by comparison with earlier publications applied to the same data sets.

IL-18 is generated intracellularly from pro-IL-18 by caspase-1 mediated proteolysis. Active caspase-1 itself is generated intracellularly by the action of the inflammasome, autocatalysis and other stimuli. The anti-retroviral drug ritonavir inhibits conversion of inactive pro-caspase-1 to active caspase-1. Since ritonavir is well tolerated in short-term use it may therefore prove useful in treating acute pancreatitis by lowering caspase-1 mediated IL-18 formation and the many inflammatory mediators downstream from that. The alcoholism treatment drug disulfiram has been in continuous use since the 1950s. It likewise has a low risk profile. Disulfiram inhibits several human proteases, among them caspase-1. Given the current morbidity and mortality of pancreatitis, research should be directed to ritonavir and disulfiram as treatment options for illnesses like pancreatitis where excessive IL-18 contributes to pathology. The first clinically used angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has shown potent caspase-1 inhibiting activity as well and should be investigated in rodent models of human pancreatitis.",

    "278": "Although the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease (CVD) is greater than for progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and reduced mortality from CVD have contributed to an increased incidence of ESRD. Use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers to reduce blood pressure is proven to reduce the rate of nephropathy progression. Theoretically, more complete RAAS inhibition may enhance the ability to slow nephropathy progression. Combining an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) more completely inhibits the RAAS, potentially providing greater opportunity for renoprotection. Proteinuria is a strong independent predictor of poor renal and cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, targeting interventions that further reduce proteinuria may yield better outcomes. This review presents evidence supporting the hypothesis that higher doses of RAAS inhibition or dual RAAS blockade are more effective in reducing proteinuria. Clinical data and ongoing trials will be discussed in the context of this hypothesis.",

ACE is well known as a key part of the renin angiotenisn system that regulates blood pressure, and its inhibitors have potential for the treatment of hypertension. This paper reviewed the characteristics of ACE in aspects of its structure-function relationship, gene polymorphism and inhibitor development. In particular, the catalytic mechanisms of the two active sites of somatic ACE in the cleavage of angiotensin I and bradykin are different. Therefore, it would likely provide a new way for exploiting novel ACE inhibitors with fewer side-effects by specifically-targeting the individual active sites of somatic ACE.",

To evaluate the coadministration of 20 mg ramipril with 25 mg HCT, we carried out a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with two dose schedules of ramipril (20 mg q.d. and 10 mg b.i.d.) and HCT monotherapy arms as comparators in 354 patients with stage 2 hypertension. The clinic blood pressure (BP) was assessed using a semiautomatic digital device and 24-h BP was measured using ambulatory BP recordings at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. At baseline, the demographics and baseline BP values were similar in the four treatment groups (age: 51-53 years, 52-58% male, 64-68% non-black, clinic BP: 155-158/103-104 mm Hg). Ramipril-HCT induced significantly greater reductions in both the clinic and ambulatory BP than the HCT and ramipril monotherapy treatments (for example, additional reductions in ambulatory BP on ramipril-HCT ranged from -7.3/-5.2 to -10.3/-7.4 mm Hg compared to the monotherapies, all P<0.001). Reductions from baseline were still numerically greater for the clinic BPs derived from device measurements than those for the BP values derived from 24-h ambulatory BP measurements (changes in clinic diastolic BP ranged from -8.5 to -15.5 mm Hg across treatment groups, whereas changes in ambulatory diastolic BP were -4.7 to -12.0 mm Hg for the same groups). Thus, these data support the use of ambulatory BP monitoring even when automated BP devices are used for the assessment of clinical BP in trials that attempt to differentiate BP responses among active comparator groups. In conclusion, based on its efficacy and tolerability profile the combination of ramipril and HCT was shown to be effective therapy for the treatment of stage 2 hypertension.",

However, their ability to preserve pancreatic function and prevent new-onset diabetes is also coming to the forefront. Secondary analyses of large-scale clinical trials, such as the Captopril Prevention Project, the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation, and the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction trial, are revealing the potential benefits of these agents in diabetes prevention. However, the results of such studies have limited application because they are secondary analyses and, in some cases, were conducted 10 or more years after the original study. Enrollees were evaluated using different diagnostic guidelines for diabetes or not formally evaluated at all. Even in the most recent of the trials, the validity of the results is questionable because researchers coadministered a disease-modifying drug with the ACE inhibitor, potentially blunting the results.

    "302": "Current best practice to reduce cardiovascular disease involves evaluating patients' global cardiovascular risk profiles and devising treatment strategies accordingly. Despite the proven efficacy of this approach, very few physicians are adequately assessing risk, and consequently patients are failing to achieve desired treatment targets. Modifying lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and cessation of smoking, remains one of the simplest and most potent means of reducing risk. Newly emerging evidence suggests that moderate physical activity (such as brisk walking for 30 minutes a day), eg, by raising levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, improves endothelial function and enhances vascular repair. However, patients remain remarkably reluctant to lifestyle changes, even in the face of overt, life-threatening disease. Statin treatment reduces cardiovascular morbidity and death in both primary and secondary prevention studies. However, over 90% of adults at high risk for coronary heart disease fail to achieve target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in spite of statin therapy. Similarly, only about 37% of patients with hypertension meet blood pressure targets. Antihypertensive drugs achieve different levels of cardioprotection. Mounting evidence links regimens containing beta-blockers or diuretics with higher incidence of type 2 diabetes. In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers appear to confer extra protection on target organs on top of blood pressure reduction. The ONTARGET Trial Program is designed to clarify the importance of this effect. Educating patients, raising physicians' awareness, and implementing effective and safe treatment regimens are all necessary steps to bring about the much-needed improvements in cardiac health outcomes.", 
    "303": "Risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes result in a continuum of renal damage. Without intervention, initial subclinical endothelial damage progresses to incipient disease, identified by microalbuminuria. Glomerular filtration rate declines, macroalbuminuria develops, and eventually end-stage renal disease (ESRD) emerges. Because of the interrelationship between cardiovascular and renal disease and their common pathophysiologies involving angiotensin II, many patients die of cardiovascular disease before renal replacement therapy is needed. Blood pressure control is key to renoprotection, but blood pressure-independent mechanisms are also implicated. Targeting the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is a logical approach to managing all at-risk patients. In advanced nephropathy, therapy aims at retarding progression to ESRD. For incipient nephropathy, ideal therapy should bring about microalbuminuria regression. In patients at risk of renal damage, preventing early target-organ damage is essential. Although evidence of ACE inhibitor benefit is limited, data show that ARBs provide renoprotection throughout the continuum and that this may be related to their cardioprotective effects. More aggressive RAS targeting by combination blockade is under investigation. Telmisartan is an ARB that delays progression of incipient and overt diabetic nephropathy and brings about regression from microalbuminuria to normoalbuminuria in hypertensive and normotensive patients. The ultimate proof of benefit will come from the ONTARGET trial, which will evaluate the cardiovascular and renal protective effects of the combination of telmisartan and ramipril.", 
    "304": "The renin-angiotensin system plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure, and blockade of this system now forms a central part of strategies to reduce the risk for cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Both angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to be effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk for cardiovascular events, but both classes of drug have some limitations. Plasma concentrations of angiotensin II increase during ACE-inhibitor therapy in some patients, partly as a result of the production of angiotensin II via non-ACE pathways; furthermore, elevated aldosterone concentrations can occur in a significant proportion of patients. ARBs block the deleterious effects of angiotensin II at angiotensin type 1 receptors irrespective of the origin of the peptide, but the beneficial effects of kinins may be diminished. ARB therapy results in activation of angiotensin type 2 receptors, resulting in potentially beneficial anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiproliferative effects, but the clinical significance of these effects remains controversial. Some ARBs, particularly telmisartan, have been shown to act as partial agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, thereby increasing insulin sensitivity. Combination therapy with ACE inhibitors and ARBs offers the potential for effective blood pressure control, decreased aldosterone production, enhanced kinin activity, and increased insulin sensitivity. The potential clinical benefits of this approach in high-risk patients are currently being investigated in the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), which is comparing therapy using a combination of telmisartan plus ramipril with the use of each drug in monotherapy.",

In the largest angiotensin receptor blocker cardiovascular outcome study to date, the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) program will compare the efficacy of therapy with telmisartan and ramipril, in reducing cardiovascular events in patients at high risk (history of coronary artery disease, stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease, or diabetes with evidence of end-organ damage). Recruited patients (n = 31,546) will be followed up for a period of 6 years, and more than 150,000 patient-years of data will be recorded. The primary endpoint is a composite of cardiovascular death, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for congestive heart failure; secondary endpoints focus on reductions in newly diagnosed heart failure, new-onset type 2 diabetes, cognitive decline, atrial fibrillation, and nephropathy. In addition, an ambulatory blood pressure monitoring substudy will be conducted to assess the effect of treatment on endpoints after adjustment for 24-hour blood pressure values. Other substudies of the treatment effects on erectile dysfunction, blood markers, arterial stiffness, oral glucose tolerance, and the progression of target organ damage are also planned. The results of the ONTARGET program are due in 2008, and the findings are expected to have important clinical implications for the management of patients at high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "306": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) plays an important role in the protection and prevention of cardiovascular disease. The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study established the significant effect of ACE inhibition on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality beyond blood pressure control. Smaller studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ARBs. In addition, a recent analysis from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists' Collaboration showed that ARB-based and ACE inhibitor-based treatment regimens were comparable in terms of the odds ratio for stroke and heart failure, independent of blood pressure reduction. There is an emerging body of evidence to suggest that a combination approach to RAS blockade with an ARB and an ACE inhibitor may further improve cardiovascular outcome compared with monotherapy with either agent alone. The large-scale ONgoing Telmisartan Alone or in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET), comparing high-dose ramipril (HOPE study dosage) with telmisartan or a combination of the two, should provide important insight into the benefits of RAS blockade intervention. The results of ONTARGET are anticipated to be available in 2008.", 
    "307": "Current guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease emphasize the importance of global cardiovascular risk, which requires the evaluation and treatment of multiple risk factors. Cardiovascular risk can be stratified with the Framingham algorithm, which produces a numerical score related to the presence of risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and smoking. However, this algorithm is not generally applicable to European countries, particularly for those countries where the risk for cardiovascular disease is low. The SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation) project has produced risk charts that are based on cholesterol, blood pressure, and age for low-risk European countries (Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, and Switzerland) and high-risk countries. Assessments of end-organ damage can provide further prognostic information, particularly in intermediate-risk patients, but the value of including additional biomarkers in risk stratification remains to be confirmed. Risk for coronary heart disease is high or very high in more than 50% of hypertensive patients. Risk appears to be underestimated in clinical practice, particularly in those patients at highest risk. Major intervention trials with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers have shown that these agents reduce the risk for cardiovascular events in patients at all levels of risk, with the greatest benefits seen in those at highest risk.",

Ejaculates were collected from sexually mature Holstein bulls (n = 6) twice weekly for 10 weeks. Testicular temperature was elevated in all bulls by scrotal insulation for 72 consecutive hours during Week 2. Triton X-100 extracts of sperm proteins were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Sperm proteins in the 110 kDa range decreased from pre-thermal insult to Day 28 (start of thermal insult = Day 0), concurrent with decreases in sperm concentration, motility, and morphology, and subsequently increased, approaching pre-thermal insult values by Day 40. Based on mass spectrometry, this band was comprised of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), Hexokinase-1, and the alpha-4 subunit of Na(+)/K(+)ATPase. Changes in the expression patterns of these proteins were confirmed by immunoblotting, including the use of a custom antibody against the alpha-4 subunit of Na(+)/K(+)ATPase (testis-specific isoform). Furthermore, a 25 kDa sperm protein (identified as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2; TIMP-2), had a low expression level in pre-thermal insult samples, increased to Day 28 of post-thermal insult, and subsequently decreased to the pre-thermal insult level by the end of the experimental period. In conclusion, we identified proteins that may serve as molecular markers of impaired sperm function due to elevated testicular temperature, with important implications for fertility predictions.

Captopril (10 microM) caused an approximately 10-fold leftward shift of the second phase response such that the first phase was masked. The second phase relaxation to trypsin was inhibited in a concentration-dependent, non-surmountable manner by the B2 antagonist, HOE-140. At 3 nM HOE-140, the second phase response to trypsin was abolished unmasking the first phase. Kallikrein (0.0003-0.3 U/ml) caused monophasic, endothelium-dependent relaxations (R (max), 33.7 +/- 14.6%), which were potentiated by captopril (R (max), 94.2 +/- 1.0%) and abolished by HOE-140. In the presence of captopril, the second phase relaxation to trypsin was only minimally inhibited by either N(G)-nitro-L: -arginine (100 microM) or 67 mM [K(+)](o) alone but markedly reduced when these two treatments were combined (R (max), 26.1 +/- 11.6% versus 98.6 +/- 2.9% in controls).

Drugs as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), thiazolidinediones (glitazones) or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, generally associated with the adequate hypolipidemic (statins, fibrates) or antiobesity (orlistat, sibutramine, rimonabant) medication, would increase those adipocytokines with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties (i.e. adiponectin or visfatin), while reducing pro-inflammatory and thrombogenic cytokines (as leptin, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 [PAI-1]).

Antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies are currently indicated for APS-related ischemic strokes, but they remain controversial for non-thrombotic neurologic manifestations. Scant literature exists on neurologic manifestations and treatment regimens in childhood APS. Modifiable cardiac risk factors and valvular heart disease may worsen APS cerebrovascular outcomes.

    "326": "With the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, we have witnessed prolonged survival with the potential for normal life expectancy in HIV-infected individuals. With improved survival and increasing age, HIV-infected patients are increasingly likely to experience co-morbidities that affect the general population, including kidney disease. Although HIV-associated nephropathy, the most ominous kidney disease related to the direct effects of HIV, may be prevented and treated with antiretrovirals, kidney disease remains an important issue in this population. In addition to the common risk factors for kidney disease of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, HIV-infected individuals have a high prevalence of other risk factors, including hepatitis C, cigarette smoking and injection drug use. Furthermore, they have exposures unique to this population, including antiretrovirals and other medications. Therefore, the differential diagnosis is vast. Early identification (through efficient screening) and definitive diagnosis (by kidney biopsy when indicated) of kidney disease in HIV-infected individuals are critical to optimal management. Earlier interventions with disease-specific therapy, often with the help of a nephrologist, are likely to lead to better outcomes. In those with chronic kidney disease, interventions, such as aggressive blood pressure control with the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists where tolerated, tight blood glucose control in those with diabetes, and avoidance of potentially nephrotoxic medications, can slow progression and prevent end-stage renal disease. Only with greater awareness of kidney-disease manifestations and their implications in this particularly vulnerable population will we be able to achieve success in confronting this growing problem.", 
    "327": "Human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has two homologous domains, the N and C domains, with differing substrate preferences. X-ray crystal structures of the C and N domains complexed with various inhibitors have allowed identification of active site residues that might be important for the molecular basis of this selectivity. However, it is unclear to what extent the different residues contribute to substrate domain selectivity. Here, cocrystal structures of human testis ACE, equivalent to the C domain, have been determined with two novel C domain-selective ketomethylene inhibitors, (5 S)-5-[( N-benzoyl)amino]-4-oxo-6-phenylhexanoyl- l-tryptophan (kAW) and (5 S)-5-[( N-benzoyl)amino]-4-oxo-6-phenylhexanoyl- l-phenylalanine (kAF). The ketone groups of both inhibitors bind to the zinc ion as a hydrated geminal diolate, demonstrating the ability of the active site to catalyze the formation of the transition state. Moreover, active site residues involved in inhibitor binding have been mutated to their N domain counterparts, and the effect of the mutations on inhibitor binding has been determined. The C domain selectivity of these inhibitors was found to result from interactions between bulky hydrophobic side chain moieties and C domain-specific residues F391, V518, E376, and V380 (numbering of testis ACE). Mutation of these residues decreased the affinity for the inhibitors 4-20-fold. T282, V379, E403, D453, and S516 did not contribute individually to C domain-selective inhibitor binding. Further domain-selective inhibitor design should focus on increasing both the affinity and selectivity of the side chain moieties.", 
    "328": "The blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may limit the progression of graft dysfunction in patients receiving kidney transplantations. We retrospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in renal allograft recipients. Fifty-seven cadaveric kidney recipients (58% of recipients), were prescribed an ACEI (lisinopril). The indications for ACEI were isolated proteinuria (1 patient), erythrocytosis (6 patients), and arterial hypertension (50 patients). The choice of an ACEI for blood pressure control was due to presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (2 patients), mild proteinuria (4 patients), and high hemoglobin (4 patients). There was a significant reduction in the mean arterial pressure after 1 month (P = .0004) and 1 year (P = .0002) of therapy. Overall, the estimated glomerular filtrate rate (eGFR), calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation, remained unchanged. Among patients who had serum creatinine values above 2.0 mg/dL at the beginning of ACEI therapy, there was a significant rise in eGFR from 39.3 +/- 13.2 to 44.1 +/- 16.8 mL/min after 6 months (P = .01), and 43.3 +/- 17.3 mL/min after 1 year (P = .04). In patients with erythrocytosis, the hemoglobin showed a significant and sustained reduction after 1 month (P = .004) and 1 year (P = .001). Six patients suspended ACEI owing to adverse events: cough (n = 4), worsening of graft function (n = 1), and hypotension (n = 1). Six patients required erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. No patient suspended treatment owing to hyperkalemia. In conclusion, ACEI were well tolerated, safe, and effective antihypertensive agents in kidney graft recipients. They seemed to have some beneficial effect in preserving GFR in patients with worse graft function.", 
    "329": "Cardiovascular disease represents a continuum that starts with risk factors such as hypertension and progresses to atherosclerosis, target organ damage, and ultimately to myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke or death. Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin AT(1)-receptor blockers (ARBs) has turned out to be beneficial at all stages of this continuum. Both classes of agent can prevent or reverse endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Such a reduction has been shown mainly for ACE inhibitors in patients with coronary artery disease, but recent studies revealed that ARBs are not inferior in this respect. However, no such data are currently available on the combination of these drugs. Both ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce target organ damage in organs such as the kidney, brain and heart, and to decrease cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with congestive heart failure. Experimental data point to an influence of ACE inhibitors and ARBs on the number and function of endothelial progenitor cells revealing additional mechanisms of action of these drugs. The VALIANT trial has shown equivalent effects of ARB valsartan and the ACE-inhibitor captopril in patients post myocardial infarction, but the dual RAS-blockade, compared to monotherapy, did not further reduce events. In secondary prevention, the most-recently published ONTARGET study provides evidence that on top of a better tolerability AT(1)-receptors antagonists are equal to ACE inhibitors in the prevention of clinical endpoints like cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, myocardial infarction and stroke. The combined RAS blockade, however, achieved no further benefits in vascular high-risk patients and was associated with more adverse events. In chronic heart failure, ValHeFT and CHARM-ADDED have shown that combined RAS inhibition with ACE inhibitor and valsartan or candesartan reduced morbidity and mortality in certain patient subgroups. Accumulating evidence also points to benefits of the combination therapy in individuals with proteinuric nephropathies. In conclusion, while combined RAS-inhibition is not generally indicated in patients along the cardio-reno-vascular continuum, it has already proven to be effective in heart failure patients with incomplete neuroendocrine blockade. In secondary prevention, monotherapy with either RAS inhibitor is equally efficacious. Furthermore, novel pharmacologic agents such as renin inhibitors may prove useful in preventing common side effects of RAS blockade such as angiotensin escape and AT(1)-receptor upregulation, giving clinicians additional therapeutic tools to optimally treat the individual patient.", 
    "330": "Despite dramatic improvements in first-year patient and graft survival rates, chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD) remains the leading cause of late renal allograft loss, while current immunologic strategies have little effect on this condition. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in progression of chronic renal disease. It was shown that plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) functions in the RAS. This study investigates the possible links between angiotensinogen (AGT M235T), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and PAI-1 genotypes with CAD. Assessments of polymorphism were performed in 127 renal allograft recipients (77 with CAD and 50 with normal renal function). Fifty healthy subjects were also considered for comparison. Genotypes were determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequence-specific primers and PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Kidney recipients with CAD had significantly higher frequencies of the TT than the recipients without CAD (P < 0.05). The transplant recipients with CAD also had significantly higher frequencies of the DD genotype than those without CAD (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed between the allelic and genotypic distributions of PAI-1 polymorphisms. Therefore, determination of AGT M235T and ACE genotypes prior to transplantation may be useful to identify patients who are at risk for chronic renal transplant dysfunction.", 
    "331": "Diabetic nephropathy is the single most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality. While the incidence of ESRD increased dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. Renal Data System (USRDS) 2005 Annual Data Report shows that 338 out of every million Americans had kidney failure in 2003, down slightly from 340 per million in 2002. This report shows that the numbers of people developing ESRD have stabilized despite the persistent increase in the number of people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). These data attest to both the efficacy of the currently available therapeutic regimens for the treatment of ESRD as well as better overall patient care. Unfortunately, these encouraging statistics do not apply to all patients. According to the USRDS report, the most marked ESRD decrease was seen in young Caucasian men (<40 years of age), while in other patient groups, particularly African Americans, ESRD has not changed much at all. These observations suggest that more in-depth studies, addressing specific issues, such as race, are needed to understand the disease process fully in order to create novel therapeutic strategies to eradicate the disease completely in all patient populations. The most commonly used therapeutic treatments for diabetic nephropathy are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor blockers (ARBs), implicating the importance of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy. The RAAS is not the only vasoactive hormonal system that is involved in the disease process. Over the past decade, studies have suggested that other vasoactive hormones, including endothelin, urotensin II, and the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), are instrumental in mediating structural and functional alterations in the renal vasculature and parenchyma, leading to the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. This review will summarize our current understanding of the contribution of vasoactive hormones in the pathophysiology of diabetic nephropathy with specific emphasis on the RAAS, especially the more recently identified components of this hormonal pathway.", 
    "332": "Hypertension is now recognized as a key contributory factor to the development and progression of kidney disease in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The renin angiotensin system (RAS) and its effector molecule angiotensin II, in particular, have a range of hemodynamic and nonhemodynamic effects that contribute not only to the development of hypertension, but also to renal disease. As a result, therapeutic inhibition of the RAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers has been proposed as a key strategy for reducing kidney damage beyond the expected effects one would observe with blood pressure reduction per se. Although the relationship between the RAS and the progression of diabetic renal disease has been known for many decades, recent advances have revealed a more complex paradigm with the discovery of a number of new components. Thus, further understanding of these new components of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), such as the angiotensin type 2 receptor subtype, angiotensin converting enzyme 2, and the recently cloned renin receptor, is likely to have therapeutic implications for disorders such as diabetic nephropathy, where interruption of the RAAS is widely used.", 
    "333": "All the components of the kallikrein-kinin system are located in the cardiac muscle and its deficiency may lead to cardiac dysfunction. In recent years, numerous observations obtained from clinical and experimental models of diabetes, hypertension, cardiac failure, ischemia, myocardial infarction, and left ventricular hypertrophy have suggested that the reduced activity of the local kallikrein-kinin system may be instrumental for the induction of cardiovascular-related diseases. The cardioprotective property of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is primarily mediated via a kinin-releasing pathway, which may cause regression of the left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive situations. The ability of kallikrein gene delivery to produce a wide spectrum of beneficial effects makes it a promising candidate in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. In addition, stable kinin agonists may also be available in the future as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular and renal disorders. However, there are also possibilities of adverse effects that may be caused by these compounds.",

Mice were treated for 4 wk with Captopril (4 mg/kg x d). Circulating levels of free fatty acids, triglycerides, and insulin were measured and glucose tolerance tests performed. Rates of palmitate oxidation and glycolysis, oxygen consumption, and cardiac power were determined in isolated working hearts in the presence and absence of insulin, along with levels of phosphorylation of Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Captopril treatment did not correct the hyperinsulinemia or impaired glucose tolerance in ob/ob mice. Rates of fatty acid oxidation were increased and glycolysis decreased in ob/ob hearts, and insulin did not modulate substrate use in hearts of ob/ob mice and did not increase Akt phosphorylation. Captopril restored the ability of insulin to regulate fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis in hearts of ob/ob mice, possibly by increasing Akt phosphorylation. Moreover, AMPK phosphorylation, which was increased in hearts of ob/ob mice, was normalized by Captopril treatment, suggesting that in addition to restoring insulin sensitivity, Captopril treatment improved myocardial energetics. Thus, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors restore the responsiveness of ob/ob mouse hearts to insulin and normalizes AMPK activity independently of effects on systemic metabolic homeostasis.",

    "353": "Hypertension control is rare in clinical practice, particularly in high-risk patients. A large factor is therapeutic inertia deriving from poorly prescribed lifestyle changes, excess monotherapy use, and scarce on-treatment modifications. The use of drug combinations significantly improves blood pressure (BP) control; in particular, fixed combinations improve therapy without increasing daily pill intake, thereby favouring patient compliance and therapy continuation. The most widely used fixed combination is based on thiazide diuretics added to either angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Several large-scale clinical trials have been conducted showing that these combinations are effective in lowering BP. However, thiazide diuretics can reduce the metabolic benefits derived from renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in high metabolic risk patients. In contrast, ACE inhibitors or ARBs combined with dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (DHPCAs) exert a marked antihypertensive effect without decreasing metabolic protection by RAAS blockade. In the recent JIKEI heart study, approximately 60% of patients affected by hypertension, heart failure, coronary heart disease or their combination in the valsartan arm were simultaneously treated with DHPCAs. Of note, a 39% reduction in the primary endpoint of combined morbidity and mortality was reported in the valsartan compared with the non-valsartan arm. Furthermore, in a recent multinational study, 83% of 3161 hypertensive patients treated with valsartan and the DHCPA amlodipine reported a concontrolled BP after 8 weeks of treatment. As expected, amlodipine did not negatively influence the metabolic profile of patients, thereby supporting the role of ARB+DHPCA combinations as effective and promising tools in hypertension treatment. In summary, the combination of ARBs with DHPCAs is an effective strategy in hypertension treatment through synergy between their antihypertensive and vascular protective actions, persistent metabolic benefits deriving from RAAS inhibition, and reduced incidence of side effects.",

Pharmacologically, we can inhibit the RAS using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 receptor blocker. Inhibiting renin directly with a clinically useful drug eluded pharmacologists until recently. However, the once-daily, orally effective, small-molecule, direct renin inhibitor aliskiren has recently changed this state of affairs. Aliskiren, with its 40-h half-life and ideal pharmacokinetics, can now address angiotensin production directly at its rate-limiting step. A novel transgenic rat model outfitted with the human renin and angiotensinogen genes allowed the testing of aliskiren in an animal model. Preclinical data demonstrated that aliskiren prolonged survival, decreased cardiac hypertrophy and the inducibility of arrhythmias, proteinuria, and attenuated inflammation. All these features might result in improved target-organ damage. Studies in humans attest to an effective blood pressure-lowering action, a largely side effect-free profile, and the option of several combination therapies. Aliskiren is the first of a novel antihypertensive drug class. The preclinical data is very promising.

In both conditions, the animals were given saline or losartan (108 nmol per animal, i.c.v.), a selective AT(1) receptor blocker. Oestrogen therapy significantly reduced the water intake induced by water deprivation, sodium depletion produced by frusemide injected 24 h before, and s.c. acute frusemide plus captopril injection (FUROCAP protocol), with no alteration following s.c. hypertonic saline injection. In contrast, EB therapy decreased the salt intake induced by sodium depletion and FUROCAP protocols, with no alteration following water deprivation and s.c. hypertonic saline injection. Central AT(1) blockade inhibited the dipsogenic response induced by water deprivation, osmotic stimulation, chronic sodium depletion and FUROCAP protocols and inhibited the natriorexigenic response induced by sodium depletion in ovariectomized rats. Oestrogen therapy significantly attenuated the losartan-induced antidipsogenic and antinatriorexigenic actions following sodium depletion and FUROCAP protocols. These results indicate that ovariectomized rats express increased AT(1) receptor signalling related to thirst and sodium appetite responses. Oestrogen therapy and brain AT(1) receptor blockade weakened or markedly decreased the behavioural responses during the nocturnal period, a time at which brain angiotensinergic activity is expected to be more prominent. Finally, we demonstrated through different experimental protocols a clear-cut influence of oestrogenic status on the behavioural AT(1)-induced signalling response.", 
    "422": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) play an important role during inflammation in cardiovascular diseases. Human neutrophil peptides (HNPs) are released from PMN granules upon activation and are conventionally involved in microbial killing. Recent studies suggested that HNPs may be involved in the pathogenesis of vascular abnormality by modulating inflammatory responses and vascular tone. Since HNPs directly interact with endothelium upon release from PMNs in the circulation, we tested the hypothesis that the stimulation with HNPs of endothelial cells modulates the expression of vasoactive by-products through altering cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. When human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated with purified HNPs, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in the expression of COX-2, whereas COX-1 levels remained unchanged. Despite an increased expression of COX-2 at the protein level, HNPs did not significantly enhance the COX-2 activity, thus the production of the prostaglandin PGI2. HNPs significantly induced the release of endothelin-1 (ET-1) as well as the formation of nitrotyrosine. The HNP-induced COX-2 and ET-1 production was attenuated by the treatment with the oxygen free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the inhibitors of p38 MAPK and NF-kappaB, respectively. The angiontensin II pathway did not seem to be involved in the HNP-induced upregulation of COX-2 and ET-1 since the use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril had no effect in this context. In conclusion, HNP may play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory cardiovascular diseases by activating endothelial cells to produce vasoactive by-products as a result of oxidative stress.", 
    "423": "Earlier work from this laboratory showed that local generation of angiotensin (ANG) II is required for the pathogenesis of experimental pulmonary fibrosis and that ANG peptides are expressed robustly in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades the octapeptide ANG II to form the heptapeptide ANG1-7 and thereby limits ANG II accumulation. On this basis, we hypothesized that ACE-2 would be protective against experimental lung fibrogenesis and might be downregulated in human and experimental lung fibrosis. In lung biopsy specimens from patients with IPF, ACE-2 mRNA and enzyme activity were decreased by 92% (P<0.01) and 74% (P<0.05), respectively. ACE-2 mRNA and activity were also decreased similarly in the lungs of bleomycin-treated rats and C57-BL6 mice. In mice exposed to low doses of bleomycin, lung collagen accumulation was enhanced by intratracheal administration of either ACE-2-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or the peptide DX(600), a competitive inhibitor of ACE-2 (P<0.05). Administration of either ACE-2 siRNA or DX(600) significantly increased the ANG II content of mouse lung tissue above the level induced by bleomycin alone. Coadministration of the ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin blocked the DX(600)-induced increase in lung collagen. Moreover, purified recombinant human ACE-2, delivered to mice systemically by osmotic minipump, attenuated bleomycin-induced lung collagen accumulation. Together, these data show that ACE-2 mRNA and activity are severely downregulated in both human and experimental lung fibrosis and suggest that ACE-2 protects against lung fibrogenesis by limiting the local accumulation of the profibrotic peptide ANG II.",

Individuals suspected of having the disorder can be investigated further with CT, MRI, or renal scintigraphy done before and after administration of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, but angiography is still the gold standard. Most children with renovascular disease will need interventional or surgical treatment. Endovascular treatment with or without stenting will cure or reduce high blood pressure in more than half of all affected children. Surgical intervention, if needed, should be delayed preferably until an age when the child is fully grown. Modern treatment provided by a multidisciplinary team of paediatric nephrologists, interventional radiologists, and vascular surgeons offers good long-term treatment results.",

We aimed to document the characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of patients with acute coronary syndromes who were admitted to hospitals in India.", 
    "426": "We did a prospective registry study in 89 centres from 10 regions and 50 cities in India. Eligible patients had suspected acute myocardial infarction with definite electrocardiograph changes (whether elevated ST [STEMI] or non-STEMI or unstable angina), or had suspected myocardial infarction without ECG changes but with prior evidence of ischaemic heart disease. We recorded a range of clinical outcomes, and all-cause mortality at 30 days.", 
    "427": "We enrolled 20,937 patients. Of the 20,468 patients who were given a definite diagnosis, 12,405 (60.6%) had STEMI. The mean age of these patients was 57.5 (SD 12.1) years; patients with STEMI were younger (56.3 [12.1] years) than were those with non-STEMI or unstable angina (59.3 [11.8] years). Most patients were from lower middle 10,737 (52.5%) and poor 3999 (19.6%) social classes. The median time from symptoms to hospital was 360 (IQR 123-1317) min, with 50 (25-68) min from hospital to thrombolysis. 6226 (30.4%) patients had diabetes; 7720 (37.7%) had hypertension; and 8242 (40.2%) were smokers. Treatments for STEMI differed from those for non-STEMI or unstable angina. More patients with STEMI than with non-STEMI were given anti-platelet drugs (98.2%vs 97.4%); angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (60.5%vs 51.2%); and percutaneous coronary interventions (8.0%vs 6.7%, p<0.0001 for all comparisons). Thrombolytics (96.3% streptokinase) were used for 58.5% of patients with STEMI. Conversely, fewer patients with STEMI than those with non-STEMI or unstable angina were given beta blockers (57.5%vs 61.9%); lipid-lowering drugs (50.8%vs 53.9%); and coronary bypass graft surgery (1.9%vs 4.4%, p<0.0001 for all comparisons). The 30-day outcomes for patients with STEMI were death (8.6%), reinfarction (2.3%), and stroke (0.7%). Outcomes for those with non-STEMI or unstable angina were better: death (3.7%), reinfarction (1.2%), and stroke (0.3%, p<0.0001 for all comparisons). Use of key treatments also differed by socioeconomic status: more rich patients than poor patients were given thrombolytics (60.6%vs 52.3%), beta blockers (58.8%vs 49.6%), lipid-lowering drugs (61.2%vs 36.0%), ACE inhibitors or ARB (63.2%vs 54.1%), percutaneous coronary intervention (15.3%vs 2.0%), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (7.5%vs 0.7%, p<0.0001 for all comparisons). Mortality was higher for poor patients than for rich patients (8.2%vs 5.5%, p<0.0001). Adjustment for treatments (but not risk factors and baseline characteristics) eliminated this difference in mortality.", 
    "428": "Patients in India who have acute coronary syndromes have a higher rate of STEMI than do patients in developed countries. Since most of these patients were poor, less likely to get evidence-based treatments, and had greater 30-day mortality, reduction of delays in access to hospital and provision of affordable treatments could reduce morbidity and mortality.",

We studied 148 consecutive patients with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction < or = 45%), who underwent electrical CV for AF in our department. The patients had New York Heart Association heart failure ranging from class II to IV. The overall CV success rate was 71%. We relied on univariate and multivariate regression and sought variables influencing success rate. Conversion success did not correlate with New York Heart Association class. Instead, we found that the greatest predictor was the degree of heart failure treatment. Patients receiving beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers, plus mineralocorticoid receptor blockers had the greatest chance for conversion success. Success was more likely in patients with coronary artery disease (91%) than in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.",

Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of morphine (0.01-1 nmol) produced a dose-dependent and significant antinociceptive effect in the 0.5% formalin test. When the doses of morphine (mg/kg, s.c. per injection) were given as pretreatment twice daily for two days [first day (30) and second day (60)], i.t. administration of morphine (0.1 nmol) was inactive due to antinociceptive tolerance on the third day. Tolerance to i.t. morphine was significantly suppressed by the i.t. injection of N-ethylmaleimide or Boc-Tyr-Gly-NHO-Bz, inhibitors of cysteine proteases involved in dynorphin degradation, as well as by dynorphin A, dynorphin B and (-) U-50,488, a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist. On the other hand, amastatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, phosphoramidon, an endopeptidase 24.11 inhibitor, lisinopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, a serine protease inhibitor, were inactive. These results suggest that cysteine protease inhibitors suppress the development of morphine tolerance presumably through the inhibition of dynorphin degradation.",

There is a wealth of information about those classes, which are known not only to lower blood pressure, but also to prevent end-organ damage and, ultimately, reduce mortality in patients. Direct renin inhibition was already targeted 30 years ago to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, but low bioavailability and short duration of action of the first generations of renin inhibitors withheld their clinical success. With the new generation of non-peptide orally available renin inhibitors, a third substance to inhibit the renin-angiotensin system is on the market, and the prototype of this class, aliskiren, has now been tested in various clinical trials in arterial hypertension. We review the studies of aliskiren and discuss its current role in the contemporary treatment of arterial hypertension as well as the possible new fields of action for aliskiren in treating heart failure and diabetic nephropathy.",

    "452": "The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) rises with severity of hypertension (HT), age, and obesity. Its prevalence ranges from 20% in mildly hypertensive patients to almost 100% in those with severe or complicated HT. However, the diagnosis of LVH is not straightforward, and the definitions and criteria used in clinical studies lack consistency. While many factors play a role in the onset and progression of LVH, blood pressure (BP) is recognized as a central factor. Twenty-four-hour BP measurements are more closely related to LVH than conventional BP readings taken in the clinician's office. Increased renin-angiotensin system (RAS) activity also plays an important role in the development of LVH, and various studies show a correlation between plasma renin activity and left ventricular mass (LVM). LVH is a recognized marker of HT-related target organ damage, and a strong and independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. CV risk increases with increasing LVM, and decreases with regression of LVH in response to antihypertensive treatment. Therefore the detection, prevention, and reversal of LVH are important goals in HT management. Most antihypertensive drugs can attenuate BP and LVH. However, each drug class may induce LVH regression to a different extent and these extents seldom correlate with the degree of BP reduction achieved. Data from the few large comparative studies in this area suggest that certain classes of antihypertensive drugs and/or their combinations are more effective than others. In particular, calcium channel blockers and drugs that target the RAS, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), appear to have a specific effect on LVH, independent of BP reduction. Guidelines, therefore, have recommended these drug classes for the treatment of hypertensive patients with LVH.",

The geometries and energies of various neutral and ionized complexes of perindopril erbumine and perindopril l-arginine have been computed using HF/6-31G(d) and Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) methods. The calculations showed that in both, the isolated state and water solution perindopril erbumine exists as a neutral complex. In the gas-phase perindopril l-arginine both neutral and ionic complexes are, at the HF level of theory, almost equally stable. The B3LYP level of theory slightly favors single proton transfer complex perindopril l-arginine (by about 14 kJ mol(-1)). In polar solvents like water, the ionized form of perindopril l-arginine becomes much more favored. According to our calculations l-arginine is bound to perindopril more strongly (by about 25 kJ mol(-1)) than erbumine.",

Here we demonstrate that cerebrovascular AT(1) receptors show increased expression (upregulation) after cerebral ischemia via enhanced translation. This enhanced expression of AT(1) receptors occurs in the ischemic cerebral arteries and microvessels, and their inhibition results in a reduction in infarct volume.

    "483": "Acute hypotensive transfusion reactions are newly characterized transfusion reactions in which hypotension is the prominent feature. The pathophysiology of acute hypotensive transfusion reactions is related to the bradykinin function and its metabolism. A liver transplant recipient on treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor developed sudden hypotension, that is, systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg, after receiving 200 mL of a blood product mixture without significant surgical blood loss. He responded to the resuscitation measure, although hypotension developed again after a challenge transfusion of 200 mL of the blood mixture. A severe hypotensive reaction to the blood transfusion and diffuse bleeding from the dissection surfaces forced the transplantation to be aborted after the common bile duct had been divided. We hypothesized that the patient had an acute hypotensive transfusion reaction due to disordered bradykinin metabolism. Analysis of his blood showed low levels of both angiotensin converting enzyme and aminopeptidase P enzyme activity, confirming that the patient experienced an acute hypotensive transfusion reaction that was due to the use of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and was precipitated by an abnormality in the metabolic enzyme pathway. It is recommended to discontinue angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and switch to a different class of antihypertensive medications for patients with a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score on the waiting list for liver transplantation.",

The duration of immobility were significantly decreased in fosinopril, ramipril and losartan in the tail suspension test and were comparable to amitriptyline. Only losartan significantly increased the rearing number of entries, time spent (sec) in open arm and in light area in comparison to control animals. Fosinopril and ramipril and not lisinopril showed significant antidepressant activity while losartan showed a significant antidepressant and anxiolytic activity. Present findings suggest that these drugs could be better antihypertensives in hypertensive patients with comorbidity like depression or anxiety.",

Heterozygous females with Fabry disease can be as severely affected as hemizygous males, who have the classic form of the disease. Enzyme-replacement therapy with recombinant human alpha-galactosidase clears the glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide from kidney cells, and can stabilize renal function in adults with mild to moderate Fabry nephropathy. However, adults with more advanced nephropathy and overt proteinuria do not respond as well. For these patients, antiproteinuric therapy given in conjunction with enzyme-replacement therapy might prevent further decline in kidney function. In this Review, we propose guidelines and recommendations for the diagnosis and management of Fabry nephropathy in adults, based on published data and on the consensus of opinion of participants in the 7(th) International Fabry Nephropathy Roundtable in 2007. These organ-specific guidelines could be easier to implement than general guidelines, provided they are used in the context of an overall multisystem care approach.",

Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were used as a normotensive control group. In untreated rats, intravital videomicroscopy showed that functional capillary density was lower in SHR skeletal muscle (WKY 395 +/- 17 and SHR 258 +/- 13 capillaries/mm, P < 0.01) and ear skin (WKY 391 +/- 18 and SHR 210 +/- 15 capillaries/mm, P < 0.01). A linear relationship was seen between skeletal muscle and skin capillary densities (r = 0.654, P < 0.0001). Histologic analysis showed that SHR had a lower capillary-to-fiber ratio in the skeletal muscle (WKY 1.74 +/- 0.08 and SHR 1.40 +/- 0.06, P < 0.01). Capillary volume density-to-fiber volume density ratio in the left ventricle of SHR was also reduced (WKY 0.55 +/- 0.09 and SHR 0.42 +/- 0.09, P < 0.01). The animals were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril, the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1) receptor antagonist losartan, the beta-blocker atenolol, or the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, resulting in similar reductions in systolic blood pressure (19.8%, 19.1%, 17.4%, and 18.2%, respectively, P > 0.05). Atenolol did not induce any change in functional capillary density of SHR. Losartan and nifedipine completely reversed functional capillary rarefaction in both muscle and cutaneous tissues, whereas enalapril significantly increased functional capillary density only in the skin. The skeletal muscle capillary-to-fiber ratio was normalized by enalapril, losartan, and nifedipine. Treatments with enalapril or losartan normalized the cardiac structural capillary rarefaction of SHRs, whereas atenolol and nifedipine had no effect. Our results suggest that different pharmacologic classes of antihypertensive drugs with similar effect on blood pressure differ in terms of their effect on the microcirculation.",

Endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and disease activity were investigated at baseline and after each treatment period. Endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated dilation increased from 2.85+/-1.49% to 4.00+/-1.81% (P=0.017) after 8 weeks of therapy with ramipril but did not change with placebo (from 2.85+/-1.49% to 2.84+/-2.47%; P=0.88). Although systolic blood pressure and heart rate remained unaltered, diastolic blood pressure decreased slightly from 78+/-7 to 74+/-6 mm Hg (P=0.03).

Ischemia was induced by right femoral artery ligature in Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) treated with or without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (Perindopril, 0.76 mg/kg/d) and angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (losartan, 30 mg/kg/d). Basal postischemic neovascularization was reduced in SHR compared to WKY (P<0.05, n=8). Treatment with ACE inhibitor or angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker decreased blood pressure levels by 1.4- and 1.3-fold (P<0.001), respectively and restored vessel growth in SHR to WKY levels. Interestingly, 14 days after bone-marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transfusion, angiographic scores, capillary density, and foot perfusion were decreased by 1.4-, 1.5-, and 1.2-fold, respectively in SHR transfused with BM-MNCs isolated from SHR compared to those receiving BM-MNCs of WKY (P<0.05, n=6). Alteration in BM-MNCs proangiogenic potential was likely related to the reduction in their ability to mobilize into peripheral circulation, as revealed by the 2.9-fold decrease in number of circulating CD34+/CD117+ cells (P<0.001) and to differentiate into cells with endothelial phenotype, as revealed by the 2.1-fold reduction in percentages of DilLDL/BS-1 lectin positive cells (P<0.001). In addition, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were increased by 2.2-fold in SHR BM-MNCs compared to WKY BM-MNCs (P<0.01), as assessed by L-012 luminescence. Cotreatment with ACE inhibitor, angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker, or antioxidants (NAC 3 mmol/L, Apocynin 200 micromol/L) reduced ROS levels, improved the number of DilLDL/BS-1 lectin-positive cells by around 1.5-fold, and restored BM-MNCs proangiogenic effects in ischemic hindlimb. In conclusion, alteration in progenitor cell proangiogenic function may participate to the hypertension-induced impairment in postischemic revascularization.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of cardiac disease management (DM) programs to assist members with their adherence to evidence-based medicine for cardiovascular diseases. A total of 20,202 members with CHD and/or HF were evaluated 12 months prior to the start of DM programs and during their first 12 months of participation in the programs. Members were assessed for their adherence to appropriate cardiac medications. In addition, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) testing rates and clinical control of LDL values (defined as <100 mg/dL) were measured. The association between LDL control and use of lipid-lowering statins also was assessed. During participation in the cardiac programs, members achieved significant improvement in their adherence to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta-blockers (P < 0.0001). The cardiac population also achieved a significant increase in LDL testing rates and statin use (P < 0.0001). More members attained appropriate LDL control in year 1 compared to baseline (36% relative increase), and this improvement was associated with a 40% relative increase in statin use. In summary, participation in these cardiac DM programs assisted members to improve their adherence to cardiac medications and standards of care guidelines. Such improvements in cardiovascular disease care are likely associated with improved quality of life and reduced risk for mortality.",

The morning (M) versus evening (E) effect (M/E ratio) and the evening versus morning effect (E/M ratio) were calculated to assess the duration of imidapril action. Morning HBP was significantly reduced (all p < 0.05) except when 2.5 mg of imidapril was administered once at bedtime. The individual M/E ratios expressed as means +/- standard deviation for systolic HBP were 0.9 +/- 0.7 and 0.7 +/- 0.7 for the morning administration of 2.5 and 5.0 mg of imidapril, respectively. The corresponding E/M ratios for bedtime administration were 0.3 +/- 0.5 and 1.0 +/- 0.7, respectively. One daily dose of imidapril taken either in the morning or at bedtime lowered morning HBP, indicating that imidapril is useful for controlling morning hypertension.",

Much of the evidence about management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treatment of these conditions. However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care. Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuation of the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions is inhibiting research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and jeopardising development of improved treatments. We advocate a change in emphasis, which makes a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough. We recommend that some factors with weak evidence of an association with cough are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause. We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.",

In this paper we report the role of effector molecules like superoxide and nitric oxide in the antibacterial function of macrophages exposed to acute and chronic doses of cocaine in vivo. Bacterial killing by acute cocaine-exposed macrophages (ACE-Mphis) increased significantly, with a concomitant rise in respiratory burst and generation of superoxide and nitric oxide, compared with control macrophages. In contrast, chronic cocaine-exposed macrophages (CCE-Mphis) exhibited limited antimicrobial activity, which correlated closely with diminished respiratory burst and reduced production of superoxide and nitric oxide. Further, a killing assay was carried out in the presence of N(G)-methyl-L-arginine acetate, an inhibitor of iNOS, to evaluate the role of nitric oxide in the killing process. The results obtained indicate that while about 30% killing of input bacteria by control and ACE-Mphis was attributable to NO-mediated killing, only about 6% killing from NO was found with CCE-Mphis. The findings indicate that acute exposure to cocaine possibly caused upregulation of enzymes responsible for the generation of ROI (reactive oxygen intermediates) and RNI (reactive nitrogen intermediates), leading to enhanced antimicrobial function. On the other hand, chronic exposure to cocaine impaired the oxygen-dependent microbicidal capacity of macrophages, possibly through impaired expression of enzymes responsible for ROI and RNI formation. Proinflammatory cytokines may play a key role in cocaine-mediated immunosuppression, since exposure of macrophages to cocaine impairs the ability of the cells to produce these cytokines.",

The treatment of infarcted animals with enalapril or losartan improved LV function and attenuated the depression in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase alpha2 isoform as well as the increase in alpha3 isoform, at both the protein and mRNA levels; however, combination therapy with enalapril and losartan did not produce any additive effects. These results provide further evidence that CHF due to MI is associated with remodeling of SL membrane and suggest that the blockade of RAS plays an important role in preventing these alterations in the failing heart.", 
    "533": "Hypertensive emergencies occur when high blood pressure is associated with the presence of acute end-organ damage, such as hypertensive encephalopathy. There is controversy as to when and which antihypertensive drugs to use in these situations. Using a comprehensive search strategy in electronic sources, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane clinical trial register, we conducted a systematic review to look all randomized control trials (RCTs) that compare an antihypertensive drug versus placebo, no treatment or another antihypertensive drug. Fifteen RCTs (representing 869 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Two trials included a placebo arm. All studies (except one) were open-label trials. Seven drug classes were evaluated in those trials: nitrates (nine trials), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (seven), diuretics (three), calcium channel blockers (six), alpha-1 adrenergic antagonists (four), direct vasodilators (two) and dopamine agonists (one). Mortality event data were reported in seven trials. Due to insufficient data, no meta-analysis was performed for clinical outcomes. Differences in blood pressure changes between antihypertensives were minor. There is no RCT evidence demonstrating that antihypertensive drugs reduce mortality or morbidity in patients with hypertensive emergencies. Furthermore, there is insufficient RCT evidence to determine which drug or drug class is most effective in reducing mortality and morbidity. There were some minor differences in the degree of blood pressure lowering when one class of antihypertensive drug is compared to another. However, the clinical significance is unknown. RCTs are needed to assess different drug classes to determine initial and longer-term mortality and morbidity outcomes.", 
    "534": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) is characterized by increased vascular tone and an impairment in nitric-oxide-mediated vasodilatation. We have demonstrated that the blunted response to nitric oxide is due, in part, to a reduction in the leucine-zipper-positive isoform of the myosin-targeting subunit (MYPT1) of myosin light-chain phosphatase. Additionally, we have shown that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, but not afterload reduction with prazosin, preserves leucine-zipper-positive MYPT1 isoform expression in vascular smooth muscle cells and normalizes the sensitivity to cGMP-mediated vasodilatation. We therefore hypothesized that in CHF, growth regulators and cytokines downstream of the angiotensin II receptor are involved in modulating gene expression in vascular tissue. Rats were divided into control and captopril-treated groups following left coronary artery ligation. Gene expression profiles in the aorta and portal vein at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks after myocardial infarction (MI) were analyzed using microarray technology and quantitative real-time PCR. After MI, microarray analysis revealed differential mRNA expression of 21 genes in the aorta of captopril-treated rats 2 and 4 weeks after surgery when compared to gene expression profiles at baseline and without captopril therapy. Real-time PCR demonstrated that captopril suppressed the expression of protein kinases in the angiotensin-II-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, including Taok1 and Raf1. These data suggest that in CHF, captopril therapy modulates gene expression in vascular smooth muscle, and some of the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition may be due to differential gene expression in the vasculature.", 
    "535": "Our previously published work has shown that non-ACE angiotensin II (Ang II) generating system is dominate in the placenta and may play a critical role in regulation of placental vascular contractile function. In the present study, using a collagen gel contraction assay we further studied contractility of placental vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in response to factors produced by preeclamptic (PE) placentas. Placental VSMCs/type-1 collagen gels were incubated with PE placental conditioned medium in the presence or absence of inhibitors or receptor blockers. Captopril (an ACE inhibitor), chymostatin (a non-ACE chymase inhibitor), losartan (an AT1 receptor blocker) and PD123,319 (an AT2 receptor blocker) were used to study the specific ACE vs. non-ACE and AT1 vs. AT2 effects on placental VSMC contractility, respectively. Our results showed that chymostatin, but not captopril, and PD123,319, but not losartan, significantly attenuated placental VSMC/collagen gel contraction, p<0.01, respectively. The inhibitory effects of chymostatin and PD123,319 were dose-dependent. Our results suggest that chymase, a non-ACE Ang II generating enzyme, may contribute significantly to Ang II generated in the placenta vascular tissue and that the AT2 receptor may play an important role in the regulation of Ang II induced contractility of placental VSMCs. These results provide new insights into Ang II generation and Ang II receptor regulation of vessel contractile function in the placental vasculature. These results also suggest the potential role of increased chymase activity and altered AT2 receptor function in placental related pregnancy disorders such as preeclampsia and IUGR.", 
    "536": "Therapeutic modulation of the renin-angiotensin system is not complete without taking into consideration the beneficial effects of angiotensin-(1-7) in cardiovascular pathology. Various pharmacological pathways are already exploited to involve this heptapeptide in therapy as both inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers increase its levels. These drugs and administered angiotensin-(1-7) elicit various common effects, and some effects of the drugs are partially mediated by angiotensin-(1-7). The pharmacodynamic profile of angiotensin-(1-7) is rather complex, and in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated a wide palette of effects for angiotensin-(1-7), some of them potentially beneficial for cardiovascular disease. Using various animal models to study cardiovascular physiology and disease it was shown that angiotensin-(1-7) has antihypertensive, antihypertrophic, antifibrotic and antithrombotic properties, all properties that may prove beneficial in a clinical setting. We also observed a novel action of angiotensin-(1-7), namely its capacity to stimulate the proliferation of endothelial progenitor cells. Access of angiotensin-(1-7) to the clinic, however, is restricted due to its unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties. In order to benefit of the therapeutic potential of angiotensin-(1-7) it is crucial to increase its half-life, either by using more stable analogues, which are now under development, or specific delivery methods. We here review the pharmacological characteristics and therapeutic potential of angiotensin-(1-7), implementing the experimental strategies taken to exploit the pharmacological mechanism of this heptapeptide in a clinical setting, and present our contribution to this field of research.",

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is highly prevalent and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Individuals with prediabetes states, with or without known CHD, should undergo lifestyle modifications aimed at preventing DM. In patients with CHD and DM, routine use of aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, along with strict glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control, is strongly recommended. Intense insulin therapy may be needed for glycemic control, and high-dose statin therapy may be needed for lipid control. For blood pressure control, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are considered first-line therapy. Noncompliance with medications and/or lifestyle measures and underprescription of evidence-based therapies remain important unsolved problems.",

We conducted a study to estimate incidence of ACE-related angioedema and explore its determinants in a large racially diverse patient population. We used linked medical and pharmacy records to identify all patients in the US Veterans Affairs Health Care System from April 1999 through December 2000 who received first prescriptions for antihypertensive medications. We studied 195 192 ACE initiators and 399 889 patients initiating other antihypertensive medications (OAH). New angioedema was identified by diagnosis codes using methods validated in a national sample of 869 angioedema cases with confirmation for over 95% of cases. Overall, 0.20% of ACE initiators developed angioedema while on the medication and the incidence rate was 1.97 (1.77 to 2.18) cases per 1000 person years. This compares with a rate of 0.51 (0.43 to 0.59) in OAH initiators and the adjusted relative risk estimate was 3.56 (2.82 to 4.44). Fifty five percent of cases occurred within 90 days of first ACE use but risk remained elevated with prolonged use, even beyond 1 year. We estimate that 58.3% of angioedema in patients starting antihypertensives was related to ACE. We also found that angioedema rates were nearly 4-fold higher in blacks, 50% higher in women, and 12% lower in those with diabetes. This study provides a reliable estimate of angioedema incidence associated with ACE use in a diverse nontrial patient population, confirming that the incidence is low, but finding substantial variation by race, sex, and diabetes status.",

We compared an exposure or \"intervention\" group of patients targeted by the action with a comparisonor \"control\" group of patients not targeted by the action. The data sources are a longitudinal database for 200,000 NHI enrolees, corresponding NHI registration data of health care facilities, and an archive recording all historical data on the reimbursement rates of drugs covered by the NHI.

However, in response to this policy change, hospitals in Taiwan tended to greatly expand the volume of drugs prescribed for their regular patients. Consequently, the total expenditures for the three classes of drugs grew substantially after the action. These knock-on effects weakened the capability of the price adjustment action to control total pharmaceutical expenditures. This means that no saved resources were available for other health care uses. Such expansion of pharmaceutical consumption might also lead to inefficient use of the three drug classes: a large proportion of patients obtained more than one day of drugs per day in the post-action period, suggesting manipulation to increase reimbursement and offset price controls. We recommend that Taiwan's government use the NHI data to establish a monitoring system to detect inappropriate prescription patterns before implementing future policy changes. Such a monitoring system could then be used to deter hospitals from abusing their prescription volumes, making it possible to more effectively save health care resources by reducing drug reimbursement rates.",

Clinical practice guidelines published by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) are focused on the crucial tasks such as regular physical activity sufficient to increase exercise capacity, smoking cessation, a Mediterranean diet, intensive control of risk factors for atherosclerosis (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia), combination pharmacotherapy and in selected cases, coronary revascularization. Of particular importance is that all patients who have had an acute MI should receive optimal treatment with a combination of the drugs that are recommended as class I by the ESC guidelines. Recent registries showed that some of these drugs, including aspirin, clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins, are commonly used in clinical practice in Poland. Recently, it has been highlighted that pharmacological therapy in MI patients should be extended by adding newer agents of the class I recommendations such as omega-3 acid ethyl esters and in selected patients, eplerenone.", 
    "585": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to lower central augmentation index (cAI), an index of arterial wave reflection, more than beta-blockers. We tested whether this is also true for long-term treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).", 
    "586": "One-hundred and fifty-six subjects with essential hypertension were randomised to treatment with either irbesartan or atenolol. cAI and central blood pressure (BP) were determined by pulse wave analysis from the radial and the carotid artery after six and after 18 months treatment.", 
    "587": "Peripheral and central systolic and diastolic BP were reduced to a similar extent in the two groups. cAI was reduced with irbesartan, but increased with atenolol (derived from the carotid artery: -6+/-10 vs. -4+/-12% after six months, p<0.001; -4+/-12 vs. +1+/-11% after 18 months; p=0.011). Furthermore, central to peripheral pulse pressure (PP) amplification was unaffected by treatment with irbesartan, but decreased with atenolol.", 
    "588": "Although treatment with irbesartan and atenolol similarly decreased peripheral and central BP, only treatment with irbesartan had beneficial effects on arterial wave reflection and preserved PP amplification. These haemodynamic effects may at least partly explain the reported differential effects of ARB versus beta-blocker treatment on cardiovascular mortality in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "589": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events in patients with established vascular disease and heart failure (HF). ACE-inhibitors have important effects on fibrinolytic balance, which may be the underlying mechanism for a reduction in cardiovascular events. Although angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) offer greater tolerability than ACE-inhibitors, the major ARB trials have demonstrated a lack of reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) occurrence and mortality in contrast to ACE-inhibitors. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of ARBs and ACE-inhibitors on fibrinolytic and inflammatory parameters in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.", 
    "590": "Twenty-four patients with uncontrolled hypertension despite taking adequate doses of ACE-inhibitor therapy were selected. Patients were started on Candesartan 16 mg once a day. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) antigen (Ag), tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) Ag, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) % activity and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, were measured during low salt intake at baseline and two weeks after therapy with an ARB.",

Calcium antagonists (CAs) and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists (ARBs)] are widely used today to initiate antihypertensive treatment but, when given as monotherapy, do not suffice in most patients to normalise blood pressure (BP). Combining a CA and either an ACE-inhibitor or an ARB considerably increases the antihypertensive efficacy, but not at the expense of a deterioration of tolerability. Several fixed-dose combinations are available (CA + ACE-inhibitors: amlodipine + benazepril, felodipine + ramipril, verapamil + trandolapril; CA + ARB: amlodipine + valsartan). They are expected not only to improve BP control, but also to facilitate long-term adherence with antihypertensive therapy, thereby providing maximal protection against the cardiovascular and renal damage caused by high BP.",

In both tissues, expression of the AT(1) was decreased by administration of each drug. Expression of the AT(2) was decreased in the cerebral cortex by drug administration, but did not change in the brain stem. This study may contribute to elucidating the relationship between AT(1) and AT(2) expressions and the effect of antihypertensive drugs in SHR-sp brain.",

    "596": "Atherosclerotic plaques were induced in the abdominal aorta of 114 rabbits by endothelial injury and atherogenic diet. Gene therapy was performed in group A at week 4 and in group B at week 12, respectively. Each group of rabbits were randomly divided into 3 subgroups which received, respectively, a recombinant ACE2 expressing vector (AdACE2), a control vector AdEGFP and AdACE2+A779, an antagonist of angiotensin 1-7 receptor. Local ACE2 overexpression attenuated the progression of lesions from week 4 to week 8, but not progression of plaque size from week 12 to week 16. In group B rabbits, local ACE2 overexpression resulted in stable plaque compositions, ie, fewer macrophages, less lipid deposition and more collagen contents, higher plaque stability scores, decreased angiotensin II levels, and increased angiotensin 1-7 levels in plaque tissues in the AdACE2 subgroup compared with those in the AdEGFP subgroup.", 
    "597": "Overexpression of ACE2 results in stabilized atherosclerotic plaques and the mechanism is probably the conversion of vasoconstrictive angiotensin II to vessel protective angiotensin 1-7.", 
    "598": "The recent discovery of the angiotensin II (Ang II)-breakdown enzyme, angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) 2, suggests the importance of Ang II degradation in hypertension. The present study explored the signaling mechanism by which ACE2 is regulated under hypertensive conditions. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that ACE2 mRNA and protein expression levels were high, whereas ACE expression levels were moderate in both normal kidney and heart. In contrast, patients with hypertension showed marked ACE up-regulation and ACE2 down-regulation in both hypertensive cardiopathy and, particularly, hypertensive nephropathy. The inhibition of ACE2 expression was shown to be associated with ACE up-regulation and activation of extracellular regulated (ERK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. In vitro, Ang II was able to up-regulate ACE and down-regulate ACE2 in human kidney tubular cells, which were blocked by an angiotensin II (AT)1 receptor antagonist (losartan), but not by an AT2 receptor blocker (PD123319). Furthermore, blockade of ERK1/2 or p38 MAP kinases by either specific inhibitors or a dominant-negative adenovirus was able to abolish Ang II-induced ACE2 down-regulation in human kidney tubular cells. In conclusion, Ang II is able to up-regulate ACE and down-regulate ACE2 expression levels under hypertensive conditions both in vivo and in vitro. The AT1 receptor-mediated ERK/p38 MAP kinase signaling pathway may be a key mechanism by which Ang II down-regulates ACE2 expression, implicating an ACE/ACE2 imbalance in hypertensive cardiovascular and renal damage.", 
    "599": "Sex-related differences in clinical and laboratory characteristics, course and prognosis are well documented in patients with heart failure. However, most information regarding heart failure therapies has been obtained from studies conducted primarily in men. Reviewing the existing literature indicates that the recommendations regarding pharmacological and device therapies should apply similarly to men and women. One possible exception, however, is the possibility of more benefit derived from angiotensin receptor blockers in women, and from angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in men. Future clinical trials should be conducted either exclusively in women or have a larger representation of women to insure the adequate assessment of the potential benefit versus risk in women.",

    "601": "The long-term benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in pediatric patients with aortic valve regurgitation is under consideration. Eighteen patients with mid to severe aortic valve regurgitation were retrospectively evaluated. Echocardiographic parameters (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, shortening fraction, left ventricular posterior wall thickness, and grade of aortic valve regurgitation) were analyzed before and during therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Data are given as standard deviation scores (Z-scores) derived from body surface-adjusted normal values. Median (interquartile range) age at start of therapy was 8.4 (5.4 to 10.0) years, and total follow-up 2.3 (0.9 to 5.4) years. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter increased from 3.6 (2.3 to 4.5) to 3.7 (2.4 to 4.8), and left ventricular posterior wall diameter decreased from 1.9 (1.1 to 3.0) to 1.1 (0.5 to 2.3). Grade of aortic valve regurgitation increased from 3.5 (2.3 to 4.0) to 4.0 (2.0 to 4.0), and shortening fraction decreased from 39% (34% to 43%) to 37% (34% to 42%). No significant effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors on left ventricular dimensions or function was found in our population of patients with mid to severe aortic valve regurgitation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may not alter left ventricular overload in pediatric patients with aortic valve regurgitation.",

The persistence rate observed after a two-year period with diuretics was significantly lower (52.8%) than with any other classes of antihypertensive agent (P<0.01). Persistence rates for beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-II receptor blockers and angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors were 69.3%, 64.3%, 60.9% and 58.9%, respectively. After two years, the proportion of patients who were 80% adherent to their treatment was 64.9% for angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitors, 65.0% for angiotensin-II receptor blockers, 64.2% for calcium channel blockers, 60.3% for beta-blockers and 50.9% for diuretics.

The associated C/E of ramipril was $15,000 per year of life saved (YOLS) over the study duration and $8,500/YOLS over the remaining lifetime. For hypothetical patients, the C/E of ramipril over 4.5 years ranged from $6,700/YOLS to more than $58,300/YOLS and was lowest among elderly men. When the remaining L/E was considered, the C/E of ramipril was similar for men and women of all ages, ranging from $8,100/YOLS to $10,200/YOLS. The analyses of MICRO-HOPE and AIRE provided similar results.",

    "611": "In the United States, patients of Hispanic descent have higher rates of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality than patients from other ethnic groups even though the prevalence of hypertension among Hispanics is lower. This discrepancy likely reflects lower rates of hypertension awareness and control among Hispanics as well as a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors in this population. Although available data suggest that patients of Hispanic descent who receive antihypertensive therapy experience responses and treatment benefits similar to those achieved by other ethnic groups, clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy have typically enrolled only small numbers of Hispanic patients. Agents targeting the renin-angiotensin system, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, may be particularly useful in the Hispanic population given the ability of these drugs to protect against hypertension-related and diabetes-related end-organ damage independent of their blood pressure-lowering effects.", 
    "612": "The Resynchronization Reverses Remodeling in Systolic Left Ventricular Dysfunction (REVERSE) study is a randomized controlled trial currently assessing the safety and efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with previous symptoms of mild heart failure. This paper describes the baseline characteristics of randomized patients; 610 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II (82.3%) heart failure or asymptomatic (NYHA class I) LV dysfunction with previous symptoms (17.7%) were randomized in 73 centers. The mean age was 62.5+/-11.0 years, the mean LV ejection fraction was 26.7%+/-7.0%, and the mean LV end-diastolic diameter was 66.9+/-8.9 mm. A total of 97% of patients were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers and 95.1% were taking beta-blockers, which were at the target dose in 35.1% of patients.

We divided the patients in 2 subgroups, with EF>45% and EF<45%. Echo investigation was performed after 1,3,6.12 months from the beginning of MI. We estimated LV EDV and ESV, EF, FS, SV and diastolic function. 12 month after myocardial infarction decreases of average heart failure and angina classes. After 6,12 months was noted decreased EDV and ESV, increased EF, FS,SV in both groups confidence, but spatially in the I gr. Patients, who had EF<45% and were treated with Preductal improved EF with 30,1%(p<0,05) confidence, which was 1,5 times more then in the control gr, also increased FS and SV by 32,7%, 13,6% p<0,05. At the same time was observed diastolic function improvement, particular decreased Ve, Ve/Va, and increased Va specially in the Preductal group more intensive and confidence.

    "615": "The acute effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) on proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) function is well documented. However, the effect of chronic treatment is less known. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of chronic ACEi on PCT acidification (J(HCO(3)(-))). Rats received enalapril (10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), added to the drinking water) during 3 mo. Micropuncture experiments were performed to measure the effect of chronic ACEi on J(HCO(3)(-)). Nitric oxide (NO.) synthesis in kidney cortex homogenates was assessed by quantifying the conversion of [(14)C]-L-arginine to [(14)C]-L-citrulline. Western blot analysis was performed to determine the abundances of V-H(+)ATPase and NHE3 isoform of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger in proximal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV). Enalapril treatment induced an approximately 50% increase in J(HCO(3)(-)). Luminal perfusion with ethyl-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA) 10(-4)M or bafilomycin 10(-6)M decreased J(HCO(3)(-)) by approximately 60% and approximately 30%, respectively, in both control and enalapril-treated rats. The effect of EIPA and bafilomycin on absolute J(HCO(3)(-)) was larger in enalapril-treated than in control rats. Acute inhibition of NO. synthesis with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester abolished the enalapril-induced increase in J(HCO(3)(-)). Cortex homogenates from enalapril-treated rats displayed a 46% increase in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity compared with those from untreated animals. Enalapril treatment did not affect the abundances of NHE3 and V-H(+)ATPase in BBMV. Our results suggest that PCT acidification is increased during chronic ACEi probably due to an increase in NO. synthesis, which would stimulate Na(+)/H(+) exchange and electrogenic proton transport.",

HFPEF accounts for nearly 50% of cases of heart failure, and its prevalence is increasing as the population ages. It is seen most often as acute rapid-onset or flash pulmonary edema, in a patient with no or few symptoms except for these acute episodes, often associated with a precipitating factor. Diagnosis of HFPEF is facilitated by the development of plasma assays of natriuretic peptides and of Doppler echocardiography. Its causes, which must be identified, are mainly hypertensive, diabetic or ischemic cardiomyopathy, often combined. Its prognosis is similar to that of systolic heart failure and leads to frequent hospitalization for acute decompensation. Its treatment calls for the same therapeutic arsenal as for systolic heart failure, except among patients with diabetes.",

To investigate the situation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), 60 medicinal herbs and 24 Chinese herbal formulae were detected by dynamic light scattering (DLS), and aggregates were observed in all the 84 solution mixtures. The aggregates of two Chinese herbal formulae, 'Xue-Fu-Zhu-Yu Tang' (XF) and 'Jing-Guan Tang' (JG), were not only able to survive in the gastro-intestinal environment, but also had the ability to pass through the monolayer of the Caco-2 cell. The activities of XF and JG against three cardiovascular targets were also aggregates-related. Based on these findings, a new possible mechanism of the action of Chinese medicine was proposed.",

Here, we use a substrate-capture assay that employs a catalytically inactive mutant of thimet oligopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.15; EP24.15) to identify novel bioactive peptides in Bothrops jararacussu venom. Of the peptides captured with inactive EP24.15 and identified by mass spectrometry, three were previously identified bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPP), <ENWPHPQIPP (Xc), <EGGWPRPGPEIPP (XIIIa) and <EARPPHPPIPP (XIe) (where <E is a pyroglutamyl residue). In addition, we identified a novel BPP peptide containing additional AP amino acids in the C-terminus (<EARPPHPPIPPAP); this novel peptide was named BPP-AP. Next, dermal and muscle microcirculations were visualized using intravital microscopy to establish the roles of peptides BPP-XIe and BPP-AP in this process. After local administration of peptide BPP-XIe (0.5 microg.microL(-1)), leukocyte rolling flux and adhesion were increased by fivefold in post-capillary venules, without any increments in vasodilatation of arterioles compared to control experiments. In contrast, local administration of BPP-AP (0.5 microg.microL(-1)) potently induced vasodilatation of arterioles (nearly 100% increase compared with the vehicle saline control), with only a small increase in leukocyte rolling flux. Therefore, the novel BPP-AP described herein has pharmacological advantages compared to the BPP-XIe. The present study further suggests that inactive oligopeptidase EP24.15 is a useful tool for the isolation of bioactive peptides from crude biological samples.",

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations using PBE1PBE functional on optimized molecular geometries have been carried out to investigate the thermodynamics of gas-phase protonation. The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) solvation method at various levels of theory was applied to calculate the free energy of solvation for the ACE inhibitors and their respective anions. The CPCM solvation calculations were performed on both gas-phase and solvent-phase optimized structures. The combination of gas-phase and solvation energies according to the thermodynamic cycle enabled us to compute accurate pKa values for the all studied molecules.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate captopril in the mealworm Tenebio molitor (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). The drug was diluted in acetone and administered topically (10 microg/3microl) on newly emerged adult females. The biochemical composition (proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids) and the ecdysteroid amounts of ovaries were determined at day 4 following treatment corresponding to the end of the vitellogenesis process. Biochemical analyses revealed that captopril applied in vivo reduced both total protein, lipid and carbohydrate amounts of ovaries, respectively. In addition, measurement of ecdysteroids by an enzyme-immunoassay indicated a significant decrease in ovarian ecdysteroid amounts. As a consequence, the reduction of reproductive capacity is possibly related to ecdysteroid production. Further experiments are needed to determine the action mechanism of captopril and the functions of ACE in insects.", 
    "621": "The complex nature of critical illness often necessitates the use of multiple therapeutic agents, many of which may individually or in combination have the potential to cause renal injury. The use of nephrotoxic drugs has been implicated as a causative factor in up to 25% of all cases of severe acute renal failure in critically ill patients. Acute tubular necrosis is the most common form of renal injury from nephrotoxin exposure, although other types of renal failure may be seen. Given that this is a preventable cause of a potentially devastating complication, a comprehensive strategy should be used to avoid nephrotoxicity in critically ill patients including: accurate estimation of pre-existing renal function using serum creatinine-based glomerular filtration rates, avoidance of nephrotoxins if possible, ongoing monitoring of renal function, and immediate discontinuation of suspected nephrotoxins in the event of renal dysfunction.",

Only a few interventions have been shown to prevent DM, with none of them yet proven to improve cardiovascular risk commensurately. Accumulating evidence suggest that drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), many of which have proven cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit, also have favourable effects on parameters of glucose metabolism and incident diabetes.

Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and death of over 30 million people each year worldwide. Hypertension is the most important modifiable risk factor for stroke. Recent data indicate that treatment with antihypertensive drugs reduces the incidence of all strokes in men (by 34%), women (by 38%), the elderly (by 36%), including those older than 80 years (by 34%), younger persons, those with systolic and diastolic hypertension, persons with isolated systolic hypertension, and those with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (by 28%). Furthermore, several large, prospective, randomized, clinical outcome trials have shown that calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are effective and safe antihypertensive drugs compared with placebo and reduce the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of treated patients. Moreover, when CCBs were compared with conventional antihypertensive drugs they demonstrated similar blood pressure-lowering effects and similar reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with the exception of a higher incidence of heart failure and fatal myocardial infarction in some studies. Considering all the evidence available today, however, these drugs should be considered safe for the treatment of the uncomplicated hypertensive patient in combination with other drugs. They can also be used as first-line therapy for older, stroke-prone hypertensive patients. The aim of this review is to summarize the role of CCBs in the prevention of stroke.",

The TTS was evaluated for in-vitro drug release using paddle over disc method and ex-vivo skin permeation using modified Keshary and Chein diffusion cell. The interaction studies were carried out by comparing the results of assay, UV and TLC analysis for pure drug and medicated and TTS formulation. Skin irritation potential of TTS was assessed by visual examination of treated rat skin. Stability studies were conducted according to ICH guidelines at a temperature of 40+/-0.5 degrees C and 75+/-5% RH. The optimized formulation was evaluated for preclinical bioavailability and antihypertensive efficacy using albino rat model. The optimized formulation provided 87.3% drug release in-vitro and a flux of 380 microg/cm(2)/hr over a period of 48 hours. No chemical interaction was found between the drug and excipients and there were no signs of skin irritation on application of patch.

Exclusion criteria included known cardiomyopathy, smoker, acute coronary syndrome, and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARAII). OS was evaluated in blood samples: thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), total antioxidant status (TAS), plasma alpha-tocopherol, vitamin A, and beta-carotene. Standard biochemical parameters including CRP, fibrinogen, lipid, and creatinine were assayed. Ten patients (80% men, mean age 55.3 +/- 7.9 years) were included and followed during a 6 month period. The etiologies of DCM were alcohol (n = 3), anti-cancer drugs (n = 2), valvulopathies (n = 2), or idiopathic (n = 3). In acute heart failure, TBARS were elevated (1.69 micromol/L; normal value 0.6-4.2 micromol/L) and TAS status was decreased (0.96 mmol/L; normal value 1.3-1.9 pmol/L). OS was more important when patients had atrial or ventricular arrhythmia. Nevertheless, liposoluble antioxidant parameters (beta-carotene, vitamin A, alpha-tocopherol) had a usual value. At the term of the follow-up, patients returned to a stable condition, OS markers revealed normal values, and every Holter ECG showed no supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. In acute heart failure, oxygen-free radicals are increased. We thus hypothetized that a modification in OS could be responsible for arrhythmias and complications of acute heart failure.",

Most aortic aneurysms are detected incidentally when imaging is done for other purposes or through screening programs. Ninety percent of these aneurysms are below the threshold for intervention at the time of detection. A number of studies have sought to determine factors that lead to progression of aneurysmal disease that might be amenable to intervention during this period of observation. We review these studies and make recommendations for the medical management of small abdominal aortic aneurysms. On the basis of our current knowledge of the causes of aneurysm, a number of approaches have been proposed to prevent progression of aneurysmal disease. These include hemodynamic management, inhibition of inflammation, and protease inhibition. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines rules of evidence have helped to define strength of evidence to support these approaches. Level A evidence (from large randomized trials) is available to indicate that observation of small aneurysms in men is safe up to a size of 5.5 cm and that propranolol does not inhibit aneurysm expansion. Level B evidence (from small randomized trials) suggests that roxithromycin or doxycycline will decrease the rate of aneurysm expansion. A number of studies agree that tobacco use is associated with an increased rate of aneurysm expansion. Level B and C evidence is available to suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may inhibit aneurysm expansion. There are animal data but no human data demonstrating that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or losartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, will decrease the rate of AAA expansion. A pharmacological agent without important side effects that inhibited aneurysm expansion could change current approaches to aneurysm treatment. Additional studies are needed to clarify the potential role of doxycycline, roxithromycin, and statin therapy in the progression of aneurysmal disease.",

Estrogen may contribute to some pain syndromes by enhancing axon outgrowth by sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. The objective of the present study was to define mechanisms by which estrogen elicits axon sprouting. The estrogen receptor-alpha agonist propyl pyrazole triol induced neurite outgrowth from cultured neonatal DRG neurons, whereas the estrogen receptor-beta agonist diarylpropionitrile was ineffective. 17beta-Estradiol (E2) elicited sprouting from peripherin-positive unmyelinated neurons, but not larger NF200-positive myelinated neurons. Microarray analysis showed that E2 up-regulates angiotensin II (ANGII) receptor type 2 (AT2) mRNA in vitro, and studies in adult rats confirmed increased DRG mRNA and protein in vivo. AT2 plays a central role in E2-induced axon sprouting because AT2 blockade by PD123,319 eliminated estrogen-mediated sprouting in vitro. We assessed whether AT2 may be responding to locally synthesized ANGII. DRG from adult rats expressed mRNA for renin, angiotensinogen, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and protein products were present and occasionally colocalized within neurons and other DRG cells. We determined if locally synthesized ANGII plays a role in estrogen-mediated sprouting by blocking its formation using the ACE inhibitor enalapril. ACE inhibition prevented estrogen-induced neuritogenesis. These findings support the hypothesis that estrogen promotes DRG nociceptor axon sprouting by up-regulating the AT2 receptor, and that locally synthesized ANGII can induce axon formation. Therefore, estrogen may contribute to some pain syndromes by enhancing the pro-neuritogenic effects of AT2 activation by ANGII.",

Mice on the normal diet were treated daily with vehicle or 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) while mice on the rescue diet received vehicle, captopril or losartan. After four weeks the vehicle-treated knockout mice developed hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy and impaired cardiac function along with an up-regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in both renal and cardiac tissues. Although the serum calcium and phosphorus levels were normalized in knockout mice on the rescue diet, abnormalities in blood pressure, cardiac structure-function and the renin-angiotensin system remained. In contrast, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) not only normalized serum calcium and phosphorus levels but also normalized blood pressure, cardiac structure-function and the renin-angiotensin system. Treatment of the knockout mice with either captopril or losartan normalized blood pressure and cardiac structure and function although renin expression remained elevated. This study shows that 1,25(OH)2D plays a protective role in the cardiovascular system by repressing the renin-angiotensin system independent of extracellular calcium or phosphorus.",

The results of large clinical intervention trials, which failed to demonstrate any significant difference between the effects of these two pharmacological classes in patients with essential hypertension, acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, supported this concept. The recent observation that a combination of ACE-inhibitors and AT1 receptor blockers improves the prognosis of these pathological conditions better than monotherapy at higher doses focused on the difference between their mechanisms of action. The results of pathophysiological studies have suggested that in the heart, as well as in the kidney, AT1 receptor blockers act in the early stages of the disease, improving left ventricular dysfunction in hypertensive patients and preventing microalbuminuria in diabetic animals. It seems reliable to suggest that AT1 receptor blockers are to be preferred to ACE-inhibitors for an early prevention of cardiovascular and renal disease. The new inhibitors of renin activity may further amplify our chances, also blocking the negative effects mediated by angiotensin II escape and by stimulation of the prorenin/renin receptors.",

If chosen, the combination strategy may warrant closer patient monitoring to detect adverse effects.", 
    "704": "Hypertension is still the leading cause of death worldwide. Hypertension increases not only the risk for progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) but also for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. For most patients it is the systolic blood pressure rather than the diastolic blood pressure that most strongly predicts adverse events. The optimal target for BP control for most hypertensive patients is < 140/90 mmHg, or < 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes and CKD. Certain lifestyle measures such as weight reduction, smoking cessation, restriction of dietary sodium intake, moderation of alcohol intake and an increase in physical activity can lower BP. Except for progression of proteinuric kidney disease and congestive heart failure (CHF), it is the achieved BP and not the class of agent that is most important in reducing morbid outcomes. If BP is more than 20/10 mmHg above the goal, therapy should be initiated with 2 drugs, one of which should be a thiazide-type diuretic. A strong consideration should be given to initiate antihypertensive therapy in patients with (RAAS) blockers, usually in concert with diuretics. Patients with proteinuria > 1 g/day despite optimal BP control with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy may benefit from a combination therapy.",

Our results revealed that I/R+ACE inhibitor, I/R+AT1R antagonist, I/R+AT2R antagonist, and PC increased BK compared with the I/R group. In addition, the effects of PC on BK and hepatic injury were abolished when angiotensin II was administered. Furthermore, administration of BK receptor antagonists to the I/R+ACE inhibitor, I/R+AT1R antagonist, I/R+AT2R antagonist, and PC groups resulted in hepatic injury similar to the I/R group, indicating that the benefits of ACE inhibitor, AT1R antagonist, AT2R antagonist, and PC were abolished when the action of BK was inhibited. Experiments aimed at investigating why BK was protective in steatotic livers indicated that BK acts as a positive regulator of PPARgamma.

This review focuses on management of hypertension in the context of cardiovascular risk in patients with PAD. PAD is underdiagnosed and hypertension in PAD is often poorly managed. Current evidence supports a low threshold for blood pressure treatment in PAD and intensive blood pressure control to reduce the high risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with PAD. Optimal treatment targets should be <140/85 mmHg, with the lower target of <130/80 mmHg in the presence of diabetes mellitus or chronic renal disease. Class-specific selection of anti-hypertensive treatments in PAD should be based on caution in relation to co-existing renovascular disease and indications and contraindications based on other significant co-morbidity. There is a pressing need for primary end-point studies targeted specifically at patients with PAD. In particular, prospective studies in PAD are needed to obtain evidence for benefits from specific blood pressure classes of treatment as well as the optimal blood pressure treatment target level. These studies should consider impact in PAD of different demographic, risk factor, and co-morbidity profiles.",

Activation of the RAAS stimulates the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which can be directly implicated in the pathophysiology of thromboembolic events. Our primary aims were to measure (1) the effect of acute RAAS activation on plasma levels of PAI-1, and (2) the inhibitory effect of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor alone, versus a combination of an ACE inhibitor and aldosterone blockade on the increase in PAI-1 usually observed. In the current prospective in vivo study, RAAS was activated by means of phlebotomy, an effective, physiologic means of RAAS activation. Seventeen voluntary prehypertensive, but otherwise healthy, blood donors were included in this study. Renin and PAI-1 levels were measured before and after initial phlebotomy. At the time of the second phlebotomy, 12 of 17 donors randomly were assigned to receive enalapril (5 mg) or a combination of enalapril (5 mg) plus spironolactone (25 mg), beginning 3 days before phlebotomy, and 5 were assigned to be controls, receiving no medications. Plasma renin and PAI levels were significantly increased following initial phlebotomy. At the time of the second phlebotomy, plasma PAI-1 activity was reduced significantly, as compared with the initial phlebotomy, but it did not return to baseline levels. The observed mean reduction in PAI-1 level was greater among the subjects who received both ACE and aldosterone inhibition. Enalapril and the combination of enalapril plus spironolactone efficiently reduce PAI-1 levels, but the reductions are more pronounced with the combined regimen.

Thiazide diuretic use in hypertensives has been associated with the development of glucose intolerance and diabetes. Some findings suggest that the probability of worsening glucose metabolism and the development of new diabetes after thiazide initiation is associated with increasing body mass index. Nonselective or beta(1) selective beta-blockers may also lead to decreased insulin sensitivity in hypertensive patients. Newer beta-blockers that cause vasodilatation and beta-blockers that have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity may not have these deleterious effects on insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may exert beneficial effects on glycemic control through a variety of mechanisms related to the inhibition of angiotensin II. These agents may be particularly useful in patients with microalbuminuria to slow the progression of renal disease. While there may be some small differences among different classes of calcium channel blockers, there is little net effect of these agents on glucose metabolism. The prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing in the US.

    "780": "Research into progressive renal scarring has been closely linked over the last two decades with angiotensin II (AII). This has led to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial scarring. AII appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of both; this may be because of either a direct proliferative and fibrogenic effect of AII or an indirect effect mediated by growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF(beta1)). These findings have led to significant therapeutic advances as ACE inhibition prevents the progression of experimental renal scarring and attenuates the progression of chronic renal failure in humans. Benazepril, through its metabolite benazeprilat, is a non-sulfhydryl orally active ACE inhibitor. The kinetics of benazeprilat are substantially affected by severe renal impairment; for patients with a creatinine clearance of <30 ml/min the initial recommended daily dose is 5mg. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in a progressive renal insufficiency (AIPRI) study confirmed that benazepril provides protection against the progression of renal insufficiency in patients with various renal diseases and that this treatment is well tolerated.",

Among the 36 recruited patients, 33 fulfilled the study protocol, including 2 weeks of run-in (standard therapy), 8 weeks of treatment (standard therapy + amlodipine 5mg once daily) and 2 weeks of washout (standard therapy). Symptoms graded on a 10-point scale (heart failure score; a higher score representing improvement in symptoms), radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (rLVEF), echocardiographic left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), peak aerobic capacity (VO(2max)), exercise time (ET) and total work load (TWL) were measured after run-in, treatment and washout periods.

    "784": "Amlodipine, in addition to standard therapy (including in all cases an ACE inhibitor), reduced symptoms and improved exercise capacity and ventricular function in patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to myocardial ischaemia. Thus, amlodipine is useful in patients with ischaemic LVD and heart failure without angina. The improvement in exercise capacity was greater in patients with scintigraphic evidence of viable and/or ischaemic myocardium and higher blood pressure. However, our study presented some limitations (i.e. an open study with few patients), and only generated a hypothesis that could lead to a wider, multicentre, cooperative trial. Treatment of patients with chronic ischaemic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) with heart failure symptoms but without angina is a difficult clinical problem. Despite the fact that surgical myocardial revascularisation may improve survival, most patients are not good candidates for surgery. Thus, 'polypharmacy' remains the principal option for these individuals. ACE inhibitors have become a cornerstone in the treatment of all forms of LVD, and have been demonstrated to improve functional class and survival. Nitrates, digitalis and diuretics are also commonly used for their effects on symptoms. Despite there being no evidence that calcium antagonists are useful for the treatment of heart failure or impaired ventricular function after myocardial infarction, these drugs are still prescribed to many patients with ischaemic LVD. However, it is possible that the concomitant administration of ACE inhibitors could reduce the reflex neurohumoral activity caused by some calcium antagonists, while preserving some of the beneficial properties of these agents. Among other calcium antagonists, amlodipine does not adversely affect the clinical status of patients. Some studies have shown that it reduces symptoms, improves exercise tolerance and does not result in neurohormonal stimulation. Moreover, amlodipine appears to have a mortality benefit in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy but not in patients with underlying coronary disease where it appears to have a 'neutral' effect. Thus, it is not clear whether amlodipine is useful in patients with ischaemic LVD, particularly in patients with silent coronary artery disease. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of amlodipine, in addition to standard therapy, in patients with ischaemic LVD and mild to moderate heart failure, assessing the effects of the drug on symptoms, LV function and exercise capacity.", 
    "785": "The aim of this study was to assess the differential response in left ventricular mass and resistive index (RI) of renal and carotid arteries in mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients after 1 year of ACE inhibitor therapy. Twenty-six patients (mean age 42.9 +/- 10.9 years) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiography and renal and carotid echo-Doppler (by measuring RI, as an expression of arterial impedance) after a placebo period and 12 months of fosinopril treatment (20 mg/day). Our study showed a significant decrease in 24-hour BP (p < 0.05), left cardiac mass (p < 0.05) and RI of common carotid and hilum renal arteries (p < 0.05). In contrast, there were no significant reductions in the interlobar renal RI (as an expression of unchanged intrarenal resistance) and in the internal carotid artery RI. While the 24-hour BP decrease was strongly correlated with the left cardiac mass modifications (r = 0.73, p < 0.005), no significant relationship was observed with the renal and carotid artery parameters. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that long-term treatment with fosinopril produced a differential response in left ventricular mass and arterial RI in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. In addition, the arterial impedance modifications of common carotid and hilum renal artery were largely unrelated to the 24-hour BP reduction.", 
    "786": "The heart failure is one of the pathologies with major social and economic impact in the western world. The neurohormonal modulation is the only effective pharmacological approach. The increasing use of implantable devices apparently sets against the possibilities of implementing in the patient's treatment scheme. However, the anti-adrenergic therapy, once used at optimal dose, is highly effective on sudden death and on rates of implantable cardioverter defibrillators discharges. CIBIS-III proposes the beta-blocker use as primary approach, even prior to ACE inhibitors. This might be specifically true in the patient whit evidence of autonomic imbalance resulting in sympathetic hyperactivity. CIBIS-III shows that bisoprolol can be used in chronic heart failure patients also in absence of the concomitant enalapril therapy. Using bisoprolol as primary approach allows to reach optimal doses more effective on arrhythmic risk.

Prior to the in vivo study, an in vitro comparative dissolution test was performed by the paddle method following the bioequivalence guidance of the Korea Food and Drug Administration (KFDA). By the results of the dissolution test it was demonstrated from the similar and rapidly dissolving patterns of the two lisinopril tablets that the two formulations were pharmaceutically equivalent. However, the in vivo bioequivalence study was required to fully evaluate the bioequivalence of the two drug products. In the in vivo bioequivalence study, the plasma samples drawn from the volunteers were analyzed utilizing a sensitive LC-MS-MS analysis method and the bioequivalence between the two drug products was assessed by statistical analysis of the log transformed mean ratios of Cmax,AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-infinity). The mean maximum concentration (Cmax) of the test and reference were found to be 60.41 +/- 20.07 ng/mL and 61.11 +/- 19.36 ng/mL, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals (C.I.) of Cmax were in the range from 0.91 to 1.08.

    "788": "Reflux nephropathy is an acquired focal renal scarring due to the combination of vesicoureteral (VUR) and intrarenal reflux (IRR) associated with urinary tract infections (IUT) and/or permanently high intravesical pressure. Up to 30-60% of children with VUR and a history of symptomatic IUT have renal scarring at the time of their initial studies. The onset of renal scarring usually occurs early in life, usually before age five years and most frequently before three years of age. Girls are at greater risk for developing reflux nephropathy, because of increased incidence of IUT. Reflux nephropathy is different from a diffuse congenital renal scarring (hypo-dysplasia), which is usually discovered antenatally or during infancy in boys with severe VUR. Without serial follow-up (ultrasonography, intravenous pyelourography, 99mTc-DMSA scan) from birth, it is not always possible to differentiate congenital renal scarring from reflux nephropathy. In contrast to reflux nephropathy, congenital renal scarring cannot be prevented. 99mTc-DMSA renal scintigraphy is the gold standard technique (sensitivity 92%, specificity 98%) for the diagnosis of reflux nephropathy, but ultrasound is a good modality to monitor kidney growth over time. Reflux nephropathy and hypodysplasia are the main causes of chronic renal failure and arterial hypertension in children and adolescents in our country. The long-term follow-up of children with reflux nephropathy is mandatory, since its complications may take 10 to 20 years to develop. Uncontrollable arterial hypertension and proteinuria are the predictors of poor prognosis. The selective use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers is the efficient antihypertensive therapy, which also modify intrarenal haemodynamics and can preserve renal function.", 
    "789": "Initial attempts to inhibit renin in humans have faced numerous difficulties. Molecular modeling and X-ray crystallography of the active site of renin have led to the development of new orally active renin inhibitors such as aliskiren. Aliskiren has a low bioavailability (2.6% to 5%) compensated by its high potency to inhibit renin and a long plasma half-life (24 to 40 h), which makes it suitable for once-daily dosing. The once-daily administration of aliskiren to hypertensive patients lowers blood pressure as strongly as standard doses of established AT1 receptor blockers (losartan, valsartan, and irbesartan), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ramipril and lisnopril), hydrochlorothiazide, or long-acting calcium channel blockers (amlodipine). In combination therapy, aliskiren further decreases blood pressure when combined with either hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, valsartan, irbesartan, or ramipril. However, the biochemical consequences of renin inhibition differ from those of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin II antagonism, particularly in terms of angiotensin profiles and interactions with the bradykinin-NO-cGMP pathway. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers, or a combination of these drugs has become one of the most successful therapeutic approaches in medicine. However, it remains unclear how to optimize renin-angiotensin system blockade to maximize cardiovascular and renal benefits. In this context, renin inhibition to render the renin-angiotensin system fully quiescent is a new possibility requiring further study. Preliminary results show that short-term administration of aliskiren has beneficial anti-albuminuric effects in diabetic patients with chronic nephropathy and favorable neurohormonal effects in patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "790": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) can be delayed by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). The mechanisms of ACEi renal protection are not univocal. To investigate the impact of bradykinin B(2) receptor (B2R) activation during ACE inhibition, type II diabetic mice (C57BLKS db/db) received for 20 wk: 1) ACEi (ramipril) alone, 2) ACEi + HOE-140 (a specific B2R antagonist), 3) HOE-140 alone, or 4) no treatment. The development of DN, defined by an increase in albuminuria and glomerulosclerosis, was largely prevented by ACEi treatment (albuminuria: 980 +/- 130 vs. 2,160 +/- 330 mg/g creatinine; mesangial area: 22.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 27.6 +/- 0.3%). The protective effect of ramipril was markedly attenuated by B2R blockade (albuminuria: 2,790 +/- 680 mg/g creatinine; mesangial area: 30.4 +/- 1.1%), whereas HOE-140 alone significantly increased albuminuria. Despite such benefits, glomerular filtration rate remained unchanged, probably because of the combination of the hypotensive effect of diabetes in this model and the renal hemodynamic action of ramipril. Finally, the renal protective effect of ACEi was associated with a marked decrease in glomerular overexpression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and transforming growth factor-beta pathways, but also in advanced glycation end product receptors and lipid peroxidation assessed by 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE) adducts. Concomitant blockade of B2R partly restored glomerular overexpression of IGF-1 receptor beta and 4-HNE complexes. These results support the critical role of B2R activation in the mediation of ACEi renal protection against DN and provide the rationale to examine the benefit of B2R activation by itself as a new therapeutic approach for DN.", 
    "791": "The discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 adds a new level of complexity to the understanding of the renin-angiotensin system. The high catalytic efficiency of ACE2 for the generation of angiotensin (ANG)-1-7 from ANG II suggests an important role of ACE2 in preventing ANG II accumulation, while at the same time enhancing ANG-1-7 formation. ACE and ACE2 may have counterbalancing functions and a regulatory role in fine-tuning the rate at which ANG peptides are formed and degraded. By counterregulating the actions of ACE on ANG II formation, ACE2 may play a role in maintaining a balanced status of the renin-angiotensin system. This review focuses on the function of ACE2 and its possible roles in kidney disease and hypertension. Studies using models of ACE2 ablation and the pharmacologic administration of an ACE2 inhibitor suggest that decreased ACE2 activity alone or in combination with increased ACE activity may play a role in both diseases.", 
    "792": "Obesity prevalence is increasing. Obesity frequently coexists with-and can cause or worsen-arterial hypertension. However, no current guidelines provide specific recommendations. Antihypertensive drug treatment is indicated in most obese hypertensive patients, leading to the obvious question: what is the best drug treatment for this population? Some antihypertensive agents may have unwanted effects on the metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities linking obesity and hypertension. Without adequate studies, recommendations for or against each class of antihypertensive agents are based on subjective criteria and pathophysiologic assumptions. Diuretics and beta-blockers have unwanted effects, whereas calcium antagonists are metabolically neutral, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may increase insulin sensitivity. The renin-angiotensin system in adipose tissue has been implicated in arterial hypertension, and sodium retention is central to obesity-related hypertension. Therefore, an ACE inhibitor or diuretic should be considered as first-line antihypertensive drug therapy in obesity-hypertension.", 
    "793": "Diabetes mellitus is well recognized as a potent and prevalent risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. However, there is also evidence of cardiac dysfunction in diabetes in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis, termed diabetic cardiomyopathy. Changes in ventricular structure and left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction have all been noted even in patients with well-controlled diabetes and without overt macrovascular complications. Insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and increased free fatty acid metabolism promote coronary microvascular disease, sympathetic nervous system dysfunction, and ventricular remodeling, and may contribute to the altered cardiac phenotype seen in diabetes. In addition to standard therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers), diabetic patients with left ventricular dysfunction are likely to benefit from targeted therapies to reduce insulin resistance and modulate substrate use.", 
    "794": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasingly prevalent public health concern and is associated with a high risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Renal impairment is frequently associated with hypertension and there is compelling evidence of the benefits of antihypertensive therapy for reducing progression of kidney disease. The central role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in hypertension and renal disease has led to interest in the ability of RAAS-blocking agents to provide benefits beyond blood pressure control.", 
    "795": "This review explores the mechanisms involved in CKD development, assesses markers of CKD progression, explores the role of the RAAS in renal disease, and examines RAAS blockade as a therapeutic option for renoprotection. For this purpose, a non-systematic literature review was conducted using the Medline database.", 
    "796": "Studies in patients with diabetic renal disease have shown that RAAS blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduces progression of renal disease. Similarly, several studies have demonstrated the benefits of ACE inhibitors in non-diabetic renal disease, although few studies have been conducted with ARBs in this setting. At present, there is little evidence to determine the relative merits of ARBs and ACE inhibitors in terms of clinical outcomes, although ARBs appear to have advantages in terms of renal haemodynamics and measures of renal function.",

    "802": "Effects of the GABA-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin and the ACE inhibitor captopril on the induction and growth of mammary gland tumors induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in Wistar rats have been studied. It is established that lovastatin administered in a doze of 80 mg/kg two times a week exhibits anticarcinogenic activity, which is manifested by a significant decrease in the incidence of neoplasms and an increase in the survival lifetime in the experimental animals. Captopril administered in a doze of 50 mg/kg two times a week significantly decreased the tumor growth rate. The chemopreventive activity of these drugs can be due to their possible regulatory influence on the processes of cell proliferation, differentiation, neoangiogenesis, and apoptosis. The results of this investigation show good prospects for the further investigation of lovastatin and captopril as chemotherapeutic agents for the prophylaxis of mammary tumor.",

Patients were classified into three groups (concentric, eccentric and asymmetric types of hypertrophy) and into three subgroups (mild, moderate and severe hypertrophy). After discontinuation of all medication for 48 h, blood pressure was measured, electrocardiography and echocardiography performed and the prevalence of supraventricular arrhythmias assessed using Holter monitoring and bicycle ergometry. Antihypertensive drugs and duration of previous treatment were taken into consideration.",

The analysis showed no significant correlation between the prevalence of atrial fibrillation and/or paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and the degree (P = 0.607) and type of left ventricular hypertrophy (P = 0.455). However, the frequency of supraventricular premature beats was higher in the concentric and eccentric types than in the asymmetric type (P = 0.048) and increased with the degree of hypertrophy (significantly in men with the concentric type, P = 0.015).", 
    "806": "Concentric and eccentric types of left ventricular hypertrophy have a greater impact on the frequency of atrial arrhythmias. In the concentric type the prevalence of supraventricular premature beats correlates with the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy.

The baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the study group was 79 mL/min/1.73 m(2), which declined to 73 mL/min/1.73 m(2) at 6 months after exposure to OSPS preparation. This finding was significantly different from the control group, in whom the baseline GFR was 76 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and remained stable at 6 months. Linear regression analysis showed that use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers and the presence of diabetes were significant determinants of the fall in GFR after use of OSPS preparation.",

    "812": "Totally 5063 consecutive patients with hypertension were investigated. Among them 1993 with diabetes underwent baseline survey. Individualized target blood pressures were set by physicians. Four follow-up visits, in weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 were performed to monitor the achievements of these targets and the reasons for not modifying antihypertensive treatments were analyzed when the blood pressure goals were not reached.", 
    "813": "The prevalence of diabetes among the hypertensive patients was 39.2%. The target blood pressure values defined by the physicians at baseline survey varied with the grade and degree of hypertension. 31.4% of the patients reached the target blood pressure goals (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) at week 12. The reasons for not intensifying antihypertensive treatment when the blood pressure targets were not achieved were manifold. The main reasons were as follows: the physicians considered that the BP value was close to the target, longer treatment and waiting for full drug effect were needed, etc. On average, 2 different antihypertensive agents were used to achieve BP target and some patients used 4-5 different drugs. The most frequent agents used were angiotensin II receptor antagonist and calcium channel blockers. The use of thiazide-type diuretics increased from the first visit to the last visit (weeks 12).", 
    "814": "The co-prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in China is high and the target blood pressure set by physician is almost 130/80 mm Hg as defined in guidelines. Only about 31.4% of patients have reached their goals 12 weeks after treatment. There are many subjective and objective reasons responsible for not intensifying antihypertensive treatment when the blood pressure targets are not achieved.

    "825": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have been emerging as drugs to treat atherosclerosis. The effectiveness of the ARB losartan at reducing atherosclerosis was compared with that of ACE inhibitors in hypertensive patients. A total of 50 patients with hypertension were divided into 3 groups: a control group receiving neither an ARB nor an ACE inhibitor (n = 14), a losartan group (n = 22) receiving 50 mg/day of losartan, and an ACE inhibitor group (n = 14) receiving either 5 mg/day of enalapril or 5 mg/day of imidapril. Atherosclerosis was evaluated based on the intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery measured by B-mode ultrasound at baseline and after approximately 12 months of treatment. After the treatment, IMT significantly decreased with losartan (from 0.87 +/- 0.14 to 0.79 +/- 0.16 mm, P < 0.05) and with ACE inhibitor (from 0.81 +/- 0.14 to 0.74 +/- 0.11 mm, P < 0.05). The reduction was comparable between the two groups, -0.078 +/- 0.136 with losartan and -0.073 +/- 0.109 mm with ACE inhibitor, and the rate of the reduction was similar between the two drugs; -0.098 +/- 0.142 mm/year with losartan and (-0.076 +/- 0.118 mm/year) with ACE inhibitor. On the contrary, IMT did not change in the control group (from 0.90 +/- 0.20 to 0.95 +/- 0.26 mm) during the treatment period. Concomitant medication and coronary risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking did not differ significantly among the groups. The antiatherosclerotic effect of losartan on the carotid artery was comparable to that of ACE-inhibitors, and less adverse effects, such as coughing that occurs with ACE inhibitors, were observed. Losartan appears to be a better alternative to ACE inhibitors for treating atherosclerosis in Japanese hypertensive patients.",

We investigated outcomes in 92 consecutive CHF patients admitted to Kitasato University Hospital in 2004-2006 for HF exacerbation with a left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% by the use of class I drugs for pump-failure, as recommended in the Japanese Circulation Society guideline. Drugs, namely angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), beta-blockers (BB), spironolactone, diuretics, and cardiac glycosides were administered to 64.1%, 59.8%, 28.2%, 96.7%, and 68.0% of patients, respectively. Patients for whom adherence to the prescription of ACEI and BB as first-line agents was high had significantly and independently better prognostic outcomes for cardiac events (P = 0.0036) as well as subsequent improvements in clinical surrogate markers for HF status such as NYHA class and BNP. Addition of the 3 latter drugs to the prescription of ACEI and BB did not affect the superiority of ACE plus BB in improving the long-term prognosis. We have demonstrated that adherence to treatment guidelines for CHF is a significant predictor of subsequent cardiac events in actual practice in Japan. An effective means of improving adherence to current guideline standards of care for CHF has yet to be established.", 
    "827": "A 34-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of hypertension with hypokalemia. Her past medical history revealed that at age 24 she had been diagnosed with left renal lithiasis and had undergone extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Physical examination showed that her peripheral pulses were intact and no peripheral edema or audible bruits were detected. Her serum potassium concentration was 2.7 mEq/mL, her plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was 96.7 ng/dL, and her plasma renin activity (PRA) was 28.1 ng/mL/h. Intrarenal lobar artery flow pattern assessed by Doppler ultrasound showed no abnormality. A renogram demonstrated a normal symmetrical tracing pattern. However, administration of 50 mg captopril induced delayed transit of tracer in both kidneys. Selective angiographic studies showed no stenotic lesions in the proximal to distal renal arteries. Blood sampling from each renal vein showed no laterality of PRA. While the possibility of the Page kidney phenomenon resulting from ESWL could not be excluded completely, the patient was diagnosed as a very rare case of hyperreninemic essential hypertension with positive captopril renography in both kidneys.", 
    "828": "Alcohol-induced endothelial changes might contribute to an increase in blood pressure in regular alcohol consumers. Some antihypertensive drugs affect oxidative stress and endothelial function and might counteract the effects of alcohol at the cellular level. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro the effects of three different types of antihypertensive agents on alcohol-induced endothelial responses and oxidative stress. Cultured human endothelial cells were exposed to increasing concentrations (1, 10, 60 micromol/L) of zofenoprilat, carvedilol, and lacidipine in the absence and in the presence of ethanol (140 mmol/L). Concentrations of endothelin (ET) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured in the culture media as markers of endothelial function, and malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular glutathione (GSHi) were measured as markers of oxidative stress. Exposure to alcohol increased the levels of ET, NO, and MDA, and decreased GSHi. Carvedilol and zofenoprilat were more effective than lacidipine in counteracting the effects of alcohol on ET production. Alcohol-induced NO production was enhanced by carvedilol, whereas zofenoprilat and lacidipine did not have a significant effect. The alcohol-induced increase in MDA concentrations was blunted by all three drugs, but only carvedilol restored a normal response. All three drugs increased GSHi levels, with the effect being greater for carvedilol and lacidipine than zofenoprilat. Carvedilol is more effective than zofenoprilat and lacidipine in counteracting alcohol-induced endothelial responses in vitro and in decreasing oxidative stress. These effects might be particularly beneficial in patients with alcohol-related hypertension.", 
    "829": "Although dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is generally well-established as a treatment for nephropathy, this treatment is not fully effective in some patients. Based on the recent evidence implicating aldosterone in renal disease progression, this study was conducted to examine the efficacy of blockade with three different mechanisms by adding an aldosterone blocker in patients who do not respond adequately to the dual blockade. A 1-year randomized, open-label, multicenter, prospective controlled study was conducted, in which 32 non-diabetic nephropathy patients with proteinuria exceeding 0.5 g/day were enrolled after more than 12 weeks of ACE-I (5 mg enalapril) and ARB (50 mg losartan) combination treatment. These patients were allocated into two groups of 16 patients each: a triple blockade group in which 25 mg of spironolactone daily was added to the ACE-I and ARB combination treatment, and a control group in which 1 mg of trichlormethiazide or 20 mg of furosemide was added to the combination treatment instead of spironolactone depending upon the creatinine level. After 1 year of treatment, the urinary protein level decreased by 58% (p<0.05) with the triple blockade but was unchanged in the controls. Furthermore, urinary type IV collagen level decreased by 40% (p<0.05) with the triple blockade but was unchanged in the controls. The decreases in urinary protein and urinary type IV collagen were not accompanied by a decrease in blood pressure. Mean serum creatinine, potassium and blood pressure did not change significantly by either treatment. In conclusion, triple blockade of the RAAS was effective for the treatment of proteinuria in patients with non-diabetic nephropathy whose increased urinary protein had not responded sufficiently to a dual blockade.", 
    "830": "The purpose of this study was to compare the combination treatments of manidipine/delapril and olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in elderly diabetic hypertensives. After a 4-week placebo period, 158 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes (age range: 66 to 74 years) were randomized to receive combination treatment of 10 mg manidipine plus 30 mg delapril or 20 mg olmesartan plus 12.5 mg HCTZ for 48 weeks in a prospective, parallel arm trial. After 12 weeks, manidipine or HCTZ was doubled in nonresponders (systolic blood pressure [SBP] > or =130 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] > or =80 mmHg). Patients were checked at the end of the placebo period and every 12 weeks thereafter. At each visit, lying, sitting and standing BP as well as fasting glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), electrolytes, uric acid, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were evaluated. Both combinations reduced sitting SBP (-27.7 and -28.3 mmHg, respectively; both p<0.001) and DBP (-15.1 and -14.8 mmHg, respectively; both p<0.01) with no difference between the two treatments. Standing DBP was more markedly reduced by olmesartan/HCTZ (-19.5 mmHg; p<0.001) than by manidipine/delapril (-14.7 mmHg; p<0.05 vs. olmesartan/HCTZ). No changes in metabolic parameters were observed with manidipine/delapril, whereas an increase in HbA1c (+0.7%; p<0.05), uric acid (+0.4 mg/dL; p<0.05) and TG (+41.3 mg/dL; p<0.05), and a decrease in serum potassium (-0.3 mmol/L; p<0.05) and HDL-C (-3.4 mg/dL; p<0.05) were found in the olmesartan/HCTZ group. In conclusion, both combinations were similarly effective in reducing BP in elderly hypertensive diabetic patients. However, manidipine/delapril offered some advantages in terms of the less-pronounced BP orthostatic changes and absence of metabolic adverse effects.", 
    "831": "Because most angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are excreted into urine, any decrease in renal function increases the plasma levels of these drugs. This study was designed to investigate the appropriate doses of alacepril in patients with chronic renal failure. The total plasma concentration of captopril, an active metabolite of alacepril, was measured in 47 patients with chronic renal failure or normal renal function. Fifteen patients on chronic hemodialysis were also enrolled in this study. In patients treated with 12.5, 25 and 50 mg alacepril, the plasma concentration of captopril was linearly correlated with serum creatinine and creatinine clearance (Ccr). There was an approximately 40% decrease of the plasma captopril concentration after 4 h of hemodialysis. Among patients treated with 25 or 50 mg alacepril for 4.5 years, the plasma concentration of captopril gradually increased along with an increase in serum creatinine (from 2.0 to 5.8, and from 1.9 to 7.1 mg/dL, respectively). Although the plasma concentration of captopril was higher in the 50 mg group, the increase in serum creatinine during this period was not different between the two groups. The plasma aldosterone concentration did not increase during this period. These data suggest that alacepril should be reduced from 50 to 25 and 12.5 mg/day in patients with a serum creatinine level of greater than 2-3 and 4-6 mg/dL, respectively, in order to maintain a plasma level equivalent to that in subjects with normal renal function receiving 50 mg/day alacepril. For patients on chronic hemodialysis, 12.5 mg alacepril is the appropriate dose.", 
    "832": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease serum cholesterol. Dyslipidemia is believed to be associated with the development of renal dysfunction. It was postulated that statins may reduce the development of renal dysfunction. The effect of statin use on the development of renal dysfunction in 197,551 patients (Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network 16 [VISN16] database) was examined. Of these patients, 29.5% (58,332 patients) were statin users and 70.5% (139,219 patients) were not. Development of renal dysfunction was defined as doubling of baseline creatinine or increase in serum creatinine > or =0.5 mg/dl from the first to last measurement with a minimum of 90 days in between. During 3.1 years of follow-up, 3.4% of patients developed renal dysfunction. After adjustment for demographics, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypertension, and other medications (mainly angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and aspirin), use of statins decreased the odds of developing renal dysfunction by 13% (odds ratio [OR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 0.92, p <0.0001). The beneficial effect of statins appeared to be independent of the decrease in cholesterol. Other variables that affected the development of renal dysfunction were age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.04, p <0.0001), diabetes (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.68 to 1.86, p <0.0001), hypertension (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.2, p = 0.0153), and smoking (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.24, p = 0.0244). In conclusion, statin use may retard the development of renal dysfunction. The beneficial effect of statins in preventing the development of renal dysfunction appears to be independent of their lipid-lowering effect.", 
    "833": "Renal dysfunction is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular (cv) disease and its associated complications. Diabetes mellitus (dm) is a common cause of renal dysfunction. Whether the presence or absence of dm modifies the relation between renal dysfunction and cv disease is unclear. The valiant trial identified 14,527 patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by either clinical or radiologic signs of heart failure and/or left ventricular dysfunction for whom baseline creatinine was measured. Patients were randomly assigned to receive captopril, valsartan, or both. Glomerular filtration rate (gfr) was estimated using the 4-component modification of diet in renal disease equation. Using multivariable cox proportional modeling, the relation of overall mortality and composite cardiovascular events with estimated gfr (egfr) between patients with and without dm was compared. Mean egfrs were 66.8 +/- 22.0 and 71.2 +/- 21.0 ml/min/1.73 m2 for patients with (n = 3,358) and without dm (n = 11,169), respectively. The likelihood of experiencing death or the composite end point was higher in patients with than without dm for each level of renal function. the augmentation in risk of cv events based on reduced renal function was similar between groups. Each decrease in egfr by 10 units was associated with hazards of 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.12, p <0.001) in patients with dm and 1.08 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.10, p <0.001) in patients without dm for risk of fatal and nonfatal cv outcomes independent of treatment assignment. In conclusion, although dm is associated with higher risk of renal dysfunction and adverse cv outcomes, patients without dm had a relation between renal function and cv risk similar to that for patients with dm after high-risk acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "834": "Early and chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in Lyfon hypertensive (LH) rats improves their blunted vasodilator response of renal medullary blood flow (MBF) to angiotensin II (AngII). This study examined the specificity of this effect and the possible involvement of nitric oxide (NO). The renal response to AngII (from 7.5 to 480 ng/kg, IV) and acetylcholine (Ach, from 3 to 192 microg/kg, IV) were examined in 12-week-old anesthetized LH rats treated orally from 3 weeks of age with perindopril (1.5 mg/kg/d), nifedipine (50 mg/kg/d), or a triple therapy with hydralazine, hydrochlorothiazide, and reserpine (75, 15, and 0.75 mg/kg/d, respectively). After 9 weeks of therapy, perindopril lowered systolic blood pressure to 113 +/- 3 mm Hg, nifedipine to 144 +/- 4 mm Hg, and triple therapy to 133 +/- 2 mm Hg compared with 160 +/- 3 mm Hg in untreated LH rats. Despite a significant reduction in blood pressure, only the treatment with perindopril significantly increased the vasodilator response of MBF to AngII. However, the vasodilator response of MBF to Ach was similar among the groups. In conclusion, a renal medullary protection is conferred in LH rats by ACE inhibition, an effect that is not obtained with other antihypertensive treatments and is not explained by Ach-induced NO release.", 
    "835": "Salt-sensitive hypertension can be caused through abnormalities related to sodium and body fluid homeostasis; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) plays a key role in this regard. The molecular basis of the purported antihypertensive benefits of some plant-derived compounds such as quercetin is still lacking. To this end, we investigated RAAS in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat model with emphasis on the kidney. Eighteen rats were treated with captopril (CAP), quercetin (QUE), and dimethyl sulfoxide (controls) over a 4-week period. CAP and QUE lowered systolic blood pressure significantly in comparison to day 0 (baseline values). These findings were in keeping with their increased urinary output, increased sodium output, decreased aldosterone and decreased AT1a mRNA. QUE did not differ significantly from controls with regards to aldosterone levels. QUE was effective in lowering blood pressure in this model of hypertension, probably because of a modulation of renal function.", 
    "836": "Although acute myocardial infarction (MI) and acute ischemic stroke share similarities, physicians need to recognize important differences in pathophysiology and how these differences affect acute treatment and prevention to provide optimal patient care. Potential causes of acute ischemic stroke are substantially more heterogeneous than for acute MI, and available acute therapies are substantially more limited. In acute ischemic stroke patients, diagnostic evaluation is paramount in determining eligibility for treatment with the only approved therapy, which must be administered within 3 hours after stroke onset. For patients having acute MI, reperfusion therapy by percutaneous intervention or thrombolytic drug therapy is well established. Because atherosclerosis is a common pathway to acute MI and acute ischemic stroke, modifying associated known risk factors is required for primary and secondary prevention of both conditions. Pharmacologic therapies recommended for secondary prevention include beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for MI, oral anticoagulants for stroke, and statins and antiplatelet agents for both conditions. Aspirin is recommended for preventing recurrence of both MI and stroke; agents inhibiting the adenosine diphosphate pathway of platelet activation, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, are also beneficial. Recent studies suggest the benefits associated with adding aspirin to clopidogrel do not outweigh the significant increase in bleeding risk. The synergistic effects of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole make this combination twice as effective than aspirin alone in secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. An ongoing study is directly comparing the combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole with clopidogrel for the prevention of recurrent stroke.", 
    "837": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), converts angiotensin (Ang) I to Ang(1-9) and Ang II to Ang(1-7), but does not directly process Ang I to Ang II. Cardiac function is compromised in ACE2 null mice; however, the importance of ACE2 in the processing of angiotensin peptides within the murine heart is not known. We determined the metabolism of angiotensins in wild-type (WT), ACE (ACE(-/-)) and ACE2 null mice (ACE2(-/-)). Angiotensin II was converted almost exclusively to Ang(1-7) in the cardiac membranes of WT and ACE(-/-) strains, although generation of Ang(1-7) was greater in the ACE(-/-) mice (27.4 +/- 4.1 versus 17.5 +/- 3.2 nmol(-1) mg h(-1) for WT). The ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 significantly attenuated Ang II metabolism and the subsequent formation of Ang(1-7) in both strains. In the ACE2(-/-) hearts, Ang II metabolism and the generation of Ang(1-7) were significantly attenuated; however, the ACE2 inhibitor reduced the residual Ang(1-7)-forming activity in this strain. Angiotensin I was primarily converted to Ang(1-9) (WT, 28.9 +/- 3.1 nmol(-1) mg h(-1); ACE(-/-), 49.8 +/- 5.3 nmol(-1) mg h(-1); and ACE2(-/-), 35.9 +/- 5.4 nmol(-1) mg h(-1)) and to smaller quantities of Ang(1-7) and Ang II. Although the ACE2 inhibitor had no effect on Ang(1-9) formation, the carboxypeptidase A inhibitor benzylsuccinate essentially abolished the formation of Ang(1-9) and increased the levels of Ang I in cardiac membranes. In conclusion, our studies in the murine heart suggest that ACE2 is the primary pathway for the metabolism of Ang II and the subsequent formation of Ang(1-7), a peptide that, in contrast to Ang II, exhibits both antifibrotic and antiproliferative actions.", 
    "838": "Injections of the angiotensin(1-7) [Ang(1-7)] antagonist [d-Ala7]-Ang(1-7) into the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) of Sprague-Dawley rats reduce baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS) for control of heart rate by approximately 40%, whereas injections of the angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor antagonist candesartan increase BRS by 40% when reflex bradycardia is assessed. The enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to convert Ang II to Ang(1-7). We report that ACE2 activity, as well as ACE and neprilysin activities, are present in plasma membrane fractions of the dorsomedial medulla of Sprague-Dawley rats. Moreover, we show that BRS for reflex bradycardia is attenuated (1.16 +/- 0.29 ms mmHg-1 before versus 0.33 +/- 0.11 ms mmHg-1 after; P < 0.05; n = 8) 30-60 min following injection of the selective ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 (12 pmol in 120 nl) into the NTS. These findings support the concept that within the NTS, local synthesis of Ang(1-7) from Ang II is required for normal sensitivity for the baroreflex control of heart rate in response to increases in arterial pressure.",

    "840": "A retrospective review of our dermatopathology database from 1997 to 2007 was performed to search for patients with NSF. The records of patients with NSF were reviewed for factors suspected to be associated with NSF such as acidosis, low hemoglobin levels, low serum calcium levels, inflammatory conditions, serum antibodies, pharmaceutical erythropoietin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), renal failure, and dialysis. The biopsy samples from NSF patients and from control subjects were examined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to detect gadolinium. Retrospective chart reviews of patients evaluated at our local dialysis center and our dermatology clinic were conducted to identify patients who underwent MRI, who had NSF managed exclusively by our tertiary referral centers, or both from 1997 to 2007.", 
    "841": "Seven cases of NSF were found in the dermatopathology database. Two of the seven patients were also followed up at our outpatient dialysis clinic. No other cases of NSF were discovered within the dialysis clinic's population exclusively followed within our institution. All seven dermatopathology database NSF patients developed symptoms of NSF after receiving GBCAs during renal failure and showed concomitant proinflammatory conditions. No other proposed risk factors were uniformly present in these NSF cases. All four NSF patients with chronic renal failure developed NSF after hemodialysis, with one patient dialyzed 12 hours after receiving a contrast dose. Gadodiamide was the only GBCA that all seven NSF patients received before symptom onset. Symptom onset was from 3 weeks to 18 months after GBCA exposure, with cumulative GBCA doses ranging from 0.16 to 0.43 mmol/kg. Gadolinium was detected in six of seven NSF patients' skin biopsies. Seven of eight random control specimens obtained from three healthy control subjects, three patients with renal insufficiency who had not been exposed to gadodiamide, and two patients without renal disease who had been exposed to gadodiamide were negative. Seventy-two dialysis clinic patients underwent 127 contrast-enhanced MR examinations from 1997 to 2007. Eighteen patients received gadopentetate, none of whom developed NSF. Sixty-three patients received gadodiamide, two of whom developed NSF (prevalence of NSF in patients exposed to GBCA, 2.8%; odds ratio, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.04-18.10]; likelihood ratio, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.06-1.26]). Nine patients received both contrast agents.",

    "843": "Bioprocesses were developed to enhance the value of proteins from deoiled corn germ. Proteins were hydrolyzed with trypsin, thermolysin, GC 106, or Flavourzyme to generate the bioactive peptide sequences. At an enzyme to substrate ratio of 1:100, protein hydrolysis of wet-milled germ was greatest using thermolysin followed by trypsin, GC 106, and Flavourzyme. For the dry-milled corn germ, protein hydrolysis was greatest for GC 106 and least for Flavourzyme. Electrophoretic patterns indicated that the hydrolysis conditions used were adequate for generating low molecular weight peptides for both germs. Unhydrolyzed dry- and wet-milled corn germ did not appear to contain angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory peptides. After hydrolysis with trypsin, thermolysin, and GC 106 but not Flavourzyme, ACE inhibition was observed. ACE inhibition was greatest for the GC 106 hydrolysate for both wet- and dry-milled corn germ. Denaturing the protein with urea before hydrolysis, in general, increased the amount of ACE-inhibitory peptides found in the hydrolysate. Membrane fractionations of both the wet- and dry-milled hydrolysates indicated that most of the ACE-inhibitory peptides were in the <1 kDa fraction. Examination of the control total protein extracts (before treatment with proteases) from wet- and dry-milled germ revealed that neither had ACE-inhibitory properties. However, when both total corn germ control protein extracts were fractionated, the <1 kDa fraction of wet-milled corn germ proteins exhibited ACE inhibition, whereas the comparable low molecular weight fraction from dry-milled corn germ did not.", 
    "844": "Clinical practice guidelines recommend blockers of the renin-angiotensin system alone or in combination with other agents to reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in patients with type 2 diabetes. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, however, may lower blood pressure but not albuminuria in these patients. Here we tested the hypothesis that combining an ACE inhibitor with either a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker will cause similar reductions in blood pressure and albuminuria in hypertensive type 2 diabetics. We conducted a double blind randomized controlled trial on 332 hypertensive, albuminuric type 2 diabetic patients treated with benazepril with either amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide for 1 year. The trial employed a non-inferiority design. Both combinations significantly reduced the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and sitting blood pressure of the entire cohort. The percentage of patients progressing to overt proteinuria was similar for both groups. When we examined patients who had only microalbuminuria and hypertension we found that a larger percentage of the diuretic and ACE inhibitor normalized their albuminuria. We conclude that initial treatment using benzaepril with a diuretic resulted in a greater reduction in albuminuria compared to the group of ACE inhibitor and calcium channel blocker. In contrast, blood pressure reduction, particularly the diastolic component, favored the combination with amilodipine. The dissociation between reductions in blood pressure and albuminuria may be related to factors other than blood pressure.", 
    "845": "It has been suggested that status as a 'non-dipper' determined from 24-h blood pressure (BP) recordings is associated with increased risk of end-organ damage but little is known about the consistency of dipper status in renal patients.

Being female, having certain cardiovascular conditions, and having a greater number of outpatient visits for diabetes increased the odds of receiving statins and ACE-inhibitors/ARBs. More frequent contact with the mental health system was associated with a lower likelihood of receipt of both medication classes; having a substance use disorder was associated with reduced use of statins.

    "857": "The Perindopril pROtection aGainst REcurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) showed the efficacy of blood pressure reduction in secondary stroke prevention. This anti-hypertensive treatment (perindopril 4 mg daily plus indapamide 1.5 mg daily) is now routinely proposed to patients referred to our department for stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prescription of PROGRESS therapy during hospitalization and to identify the predictors of therapy discontinuation after discharge. Eligible patients admitted to the Amiens University hospital for acute stroke or TIA from January to April 2003 were included (n = 101). At 1 year, the use of PROGRESS therapy was evaluated by structured phone interviews. In addition, each patient's general practitioner (GP) was also contacted to provide information. PROGRESS therapy was mentioned on the hospital discharge summary significantly less frequently after cardioembolic stroke (OR: 0.15; 95% CI: 0.05-0.5; P = 0.001) and TIA (OR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.02-0.7; P = 0.02). At 1 year, only 25.7% of patients were treated with optimal PROGRESS therapy (perindopril 4 mg daily plus indapamide 1.5 mg daily). Mention of PROGRESS therapy in the discharge summary was the main predictor of optimal PROGRESS therapy at 1 year (OR: 10.8; 95% CI: 1.3-88.3; P = 0.03). This study shows that mention of PROGRESS therapy in the discharge summary must be improved as it is associated with a higher use of these anti-hypertensive agents 1 year after stroke/TIA.", 
    "858": "The antihypertensive action of a crude ethanolic extract (EEEG) from leaves of Echinodorus grandiflorus (Alismataceae) was investigated in spontaneously hypertensive rats. The intraperitoneal injection of increasing doses of EEEG (300-1000 mg/kg) elicited dose-dependent reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) that were paralleled by reductions of cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance, reaching the maximum of 23 +/- 5%, 13 +/- 3% and 18 +/- 4%, respectively (n = 5, P < 0.05). Comparable reductions of MAP were obtained upon i.v. administration of EEEG (3-100 mg/kg), reaching the maximum decrease of 51 +/- 6% (n = 7; P < 0.001). The blockade of nitric oxide synthesis significantly reduced the hypotension induced by i.v. administration of EEEG. Moreover, the pre-treatment of the animals with a selective antagonist of cholinergic muscarinic receptors or of platelet-activating factor (PAF) receptors partially blunted the cardiovascular effects of EEEG. The i.v. pre-treatment with the selective B(2) bradykinin receptor antagonist HOE 140 or with indomethacin, an inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, did not prevent the hypotensive effects induced by EEEG. Finally, the chronic oral treatment with EEEG presented a significant antihypertensive effect that was comparable to that of reference antihypertensive drugs currently used to treat arterial hypertension. It is concluded that EEEG elicits significant acute antihypertensive effects through the release of nitric oxide and the stimulation of cholinergic muscarinic and PAF receptors. Moreover, our results suggest that EEEG may be appropriate to chronic oral treatment of arterial hypertension.", 
    "859": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) with ACE inhibitors has been a cornerstone of heart failure therapy for over 15 years. More recently, further blockade of RAAS with aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has been studied. While these therapies have certainly improved outcomes in the treatment of heart failure, morbidity and mortality remain extremely high. Furthermore, polypharmacy and complex regimens of seven medications on average is the norm for management of heart failure. This results in increased costs, patient burden, and uncertainty as to the best course of therapy. The ability to personalize patients' therapeutic regimens using pharmacogenomics has the potential of providing more effective and efficient use of RAAS-modulating medications. This review highlights the implications of major RAAS pharmacogenetic studies, while outlining future directions for translation to practice.", 
    "860": "Although tighter blood pressure control is considered the main mechanism for preventing the progression of chronic renal failure, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptors blockers seem to have an additional organ protective role. The effects of calcium antagonists in renal disease are not so clearly defined. Calcium antagonists have pleiotropic effects that might contribute to protect the kidney, such as attenuating mesangial entrapment of macromolecules, countervailing the mitogenic effect of platelet-derived growth factors and platelet-activating factors, and suppressing mesangial cell proliferation. They could also act as free radical scavengers and inhibit the renal effects of endothelin. Some evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that certain new dihydropyridinic calcium antagonists may affect postglomerular as well as preglomerular vessels, resulting in decreased filtration fraction and nephroprotective effect as renin-angiotensin axis-blocking drugs. Though there are few reports on the clinical renal effects of new calcium antagonists, they have rendered promising results. Manidipine does not increase proteinuria as do some classic calcium antagonists, and lercanidipine combined with renin-angiotensin axis-blocking drugs reduce proteinuria. Both drugs have been shown to decrease microalbuminuria when administered alone.",

In total, 4097 subjects with hypertension were included in this study. The drug-gene interaction on the risk of MI or stroke was determined with a Cox proportional hazard model. The risk of MI was reduced in current users of ACE inhibitors with the AGTR1 573CT or CC genotype compared to ACE inhibitors with the AGTR1 573TT genotype (synergy index (SI):0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.70). No significant drug-gene interaction was found on the risk of stroke (SI:0.82; 95% CI: 0.44-1.52) or in beta-blocker users. Also, no significant drug-gene interaction was found with the ACE I/D polymorphism. In conclusion, subjects with at least one copy of the AGTR1 573C allele might have more benefit from ACE inhibitor therapy.", 
    "862": "Poor control of clinic and 24-h blood pressure (BP) is associated with enhanced risk of all cardiovascular disease events. Certain patient groups including the elderly, African-Americans, and those with hypertension and comorbid disease are difficult to control, as are patients with stage 2 hypertension (systolic BP>or=160 mmHg or diastolic BP>or=100 mmHg). It has been estimated that more than two-thirds of high-risk hypertensive patients with stage 2 hypertension and all hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus or kidney disease will require two or more antihypertensive agents from different therapeutic classes to reach BP goals. Combining agents with distinct and complementary modes of action can address different pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in hypertension and may lead to more complete and prompt reductions in BP. Tolerability may also improve, as certain classes of antihypertensive agents ameliorate adverse effects associated with other agents. Patients may benefit from fixed-dose combinations of drugs as this simplifies the regimen and may improve adherence with therapy, control of BP, and ultimately lead to reductions in cardiovascular events. Recent data and treatment guidelines support the use of a combination strategy as 'initial' antihypertensive therapy in high-risk patients with stage 2 hypertension.",

Patients were treated for 24-weeks on a stepwise regimen with cilazapril alone or a cilazapril/hydrochlorothiazide/amlodipine combination therapy to achieve a BP lower than 140/90 mmHg. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), echocardiography, and albuminuria were assessed before and after the intervention.",

Similar reductions in daytime-SBP/DBP: -22.5/-14.1(troncular obesity)/-23.6/-14.9 mmHg (peripheral obesity) were obtained. Decrease in nocturnal-SBP was greater in troncular obesity patients. Upon BP control, microalbuminuria was markedly decreased, while only slight decrease in left ventricular mass was observed for both groups.",

It affects 4% of Australians aged 45 years or over with the prevalence increasing from about 1% at age 50-59 years to more than 50% at 84 years of age and over. Patients with heart failure are increasingly managed in the primary care setting, and the emphasis of new national programs on early recognition of signs and diagnosis of heart failure suggest that this trend will continue.

    "882": "Evidence from experimental animal studies indicate that ACE inhibition expands collateral blood flow both in ischemic hearts and peripheral limbs. The present study evaluates whether ACE inhibitor induces collateral blood flow expansion and change of angiogenic gene expression profile in collateral arteries during remodeling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 350 g were treated with vehicle (control) or quinapril (ACE inhibitor) at either low dose (3.0 mg/kg) or high dose (18 mg/kg) for 1, 3, 7, 14 days (gene expression) or 16 days (blood flow). All rats received bilateral occlusions of the femoral arteries. Collateral blood flow to the hind limb was assessed by 85Sr and 141Ce-labeled microspheres during treadmill running at 15 and 25 m/min speeds. Quinapril reduced plasma ACE activity by 58% and 88% for the low-dose and high-dose groups, respectively (P < 0.001). High-dose quinapril reduced exercising blood pressure (P < 0.05) and increased hind limb conductance. Collateral blood flows to calf muscles were 51 +/- 3.7, 73 +/- 5.0, and 68 +/- 1.9 mL/min per 100 g in control and quinapril low- and high-dose groups, respectively, during high-speed running (P < 0.001). Real-time RT-PCR revealed that ACE inhibition shifted gene expression to a proangiogenic phenotype in the newly developed collateral arteries. Our findings indicate that ACE inhibition could increase collateral-dependent blood flow and collateral vessel remodeling by promoting proangiogenic gene expression in newly developed collateral arteries. Our results support the potential utility of ACE inhibitor as a therapeutic agent in treating peripheral occlusive arterial disease.", 
    "883": "Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of the calcineurin signaling pathway in mediating the development of cardiac hypertrophy. It has also been reported that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) regressed cardiac hypertrophy in some animal and human models. In this study, we investigated the possible role of calcineurin in the regression of cardiac hypertrophy induced by the ACEI perindopril in rats with renovascular hypertension. The effect of the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) was also studied. Starting from 2 months after a two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) procedure, the rats that had developed progressive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy were daily administered perindopril (1 mg/kg per day) or CsA (20 mg/kg per day) until 3 months. At the end of either treatment, the LV gravimetric, morphometric and histological measurements revealed the regression of LV hypertrophy; and the enzymatic assay, Western blotting and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that both calcineurin activity and the calcineurin protein and mRNA expression levels were significantly decreased compared with untreated 2K1C rats, but that LV systolic performance was unchanged by either treatment. These data suggest that the cardiac hypertrophy regression induced by the ACEI perindopril is likely mediated, at least in part, through inhibition of the calcineurin signaling pathway.", 
    "884": "The angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) telmisartan is a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Typical PPARgamma agonists suppress the gene expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vascular tissues. However, it remains unclear whether or not PPARgamma activation by telmisartan can inhibit vascular ACE activity. We compared the effects of PPARgamma agonistic telmisartan and non-agonistic valsartan on ACE, vascular function and oxidative stress in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) and in sodium (1% NaCl)-loaded SHR-SP. SHR-SP and sodium-loaded SHR-SP received placebo, 1 mg/kg telmisartan, or 10 mg/kg valsartan for 2 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was equally reduced in SHR-SP given either telmisartan or valsartan compared with SHR-SP given placebo. However, neither telmisartan nor valsartan suppressed SBP in sodium-loaded SHR-SP. Acetylcholine induced significantly less vasorelaxation in SHR-SP than in Wistar-Kyoto rats, but telmisartan and valsartan each significantly prevented such vasorelaxation. However, telmisartan significantly attenuated acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation in sodium-loaded SHR-SP, whereas valsartan did not. Telmisartan significantly attenuated NADPH oxidase subunit p22(phox) gene expression in both SHR-SP and sodium-loaded SHR-SP, whereas valsartan did not. Likewise, telmisartan also significantly attenuated the significantly increased vascular ACE activity in sodium-loaded SHR-SP, whereas valsartan did not. In conclusion, the partial PPARgamma agonist telmisartan might inhibit vascular ACE activity, and result in the prevention of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction more effectively than non-agonistic valsartan.",

In arteriosclerotic plaques, characterized by increased oxidized LDL and cytokine levels, a sustained local NO reduction might enhance sensitivity of the downstream guanylyl cyclase system towards an acute NO increase. We tested whether application of the NO synthase substrate l-arginine (l-arg, 150 micromol min(-1)) or the NO donor isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN; 0.3 mg) preferentially dilates stenotic coronary artery segments (CS) subsequently increasing poststenotic coronary blood flow (CBF) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).",

    "905": "Despite the scientific evidence that secondary prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established atherosclerosis, these therapies continue to be underused in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, the University of California, Los Angeles, Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program was implemented in 1994. This hospital-based system focused on initiation of antiplatelet therapy, beta-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and statin therapy (irrespective of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling in patients hospitalized with coronary artery and other atherosclerotic vascular disease. Preprinted orders, critical pathways, discharge forms, physician and nursing education, pocket cards, patient educational material, and treatment utilization reports facilitated program implementation. Statin use at the time of discharge increased from 6% before initiation of the program to 86% after the Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program was implemented (P < 0.001). Improved use of aspirin, beta-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors was also observed. Importantly, in-hospital initiation of cardiovascular protective therapies had a dramatic effect on long-term treatment rates and patient compliance. The improved use of cardiovascular protective therapies was associated with a significant reduction in clinical events the first year after discharge: the death and nonfatal myocardial infarction rate decreased from 14.8% to 6.4% (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.27-0.59; P < 0.01). These improved treatment rates have been sustained over an 8-year period. Compared with conventional care, the Cardiovascular Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program has been associated with a significant increase in treatment utilization of evidence-based medications, more patients achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL, and improved clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized for cardiovascular disease. Hospital-based atherosclerosis treatment systems are an important step to help eliminate the cardiovascular treatment gap and dramatically reduce the death and disability caused by atherosclerotic vascular disease.",

The proposed critical pathway targets 100% use of fibrinolysis in fibrinolytic-eligible patients, 95% use of aspirin, and 90% use of beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) and incorporates a strategy of early hospital discharge for low-risk patients. Risk reduction for each intervention was estimated based on the benefits seen in large randomized controlled clinical trials or meta-analysis.", 
    "908": "In the TIMI 9 Registry, fibrinolysis was used in 60% of the patients; primary percutaneous coronary intervention, in 9%; and no reperfusion therapy, in 31%. Only 87% of the registry patients took aspirin during hospitalization. Of those with documented left ventricular dysfunction or congestive heart failure, 32% were discharged on ACE-I; and of those with normal ejection fraction and no evidence of congestive heat failure, only 58% were treated with beta-blockers at discharge. For early benefit and by increasing the use of reperfusion therapy and aspirin to 95% and improving the time to treatment, one could potentially save 13 lives per 1,000 patients treated per year. Similarly, if beta-blocker and ACE-I use increased up to 90% for the long term, almost 2 lives per 1,000 patients treated per year could potentially be saved. In summary, by expanding the use of a critical pathway for thrombolysis in STEMI, 15 lives per 1,000 patients treated per year could be saved. To evaluate the potential economic impact of this critical pathway on low-risk patients, 358 of 505 thrombolysis patients had no recurrent ischemia, MI, shock, or congestive heart failure through day 5. Their median length of stay was 6.7 days (25-75th percentiles, range, 4.8-10.3 days), with 73% staying in-hospital more than the target of 5 days, with similar findings for patients treated with primary angioplasty.",

An early invasive strategy (catheterization/revascularization) in conjunction with aggressive antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy offers the most effective means of reducing ischemic complications in intermediate- and high-risk patients. In low-risk patients, stress testing serves to indicate whether a secondary prevention strategy or elective catheterization/percutaneous coronary intervention and GP IIb/IIIa inhibition is more appropriate. NSTE ACS also confers a long-term risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, regardless of whether initial management follows a medical or interventional approach. Combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy is effective for secondary prevention across the spectrum of NSTE ACS patients, regardless of risk or initial treatment strategy (conservative or invasive). Long-term aspirin and clopidogrel therapy addresses the thrombotic component of atherothrombosis, while combined beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin therapy is directed against the atheroma.",

For those patients with STEMI, all received I.V. reperfusion therapy (I.V. tenecteplase), when standardized orders were used. This was not nearly the case when de novo orders were written by the physician. The same finding prevailed for the use of I.V. eptifibatide in the NSTEMI patients, when standardized orders were compared with de novo order sheets. Cardiac rehabilitation (phase I) was ordered more frequently in the patient subset that had the initiation of therapy with the standardized orders compared with the de novo orders. A perplexing issue did arise on review of discharge medications. Those patients who had their care initiated with standardized orders were less likely to go home on their hospitalization medications (aspirin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors) than those patient that had their hospital care initiated with the de novo orders.",

In particular, the occurrence of left ventricular hypertrophy is a strong predictor for the development of AF, ventricular ectopy and sudden cardiac death. Recent prospective clinical trials reveal that antihypertensive therapy may delay or prevent the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with hypertension.

Enalapril and losartan each reduced hypertension, proteinuria, glomerular extracellular matrix deposition, and mesangial cell activation in TSLPtg mice. These renoprotective effects were not observed with hydralazine treatment, despite a similar antihypertensive effect. Treatment with enalapril or losartan also decreased renal plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in TSLPtg mice, assessed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. None of the treatments affected immune complex deposition or macrophage infiltration. Overall, enalapril- and losartan-treated TSLPtg mice survived significantly longer than untreated TSLPtg mice.

Irbesartan reduced PP in 7.2% vs 8.3% with ACEI (NS). CrCl reduction with Irbesartan was 0.23 vs 0.21 ml/min/month with ACEI (NS).

    "935": "Previous studies have indicated that high levels of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This study examined the association between UAE and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The study included 35 newly diagnosed OSAS patients and 11 nonapneic controls. Subjects with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, a history of renal failure, cardiac failure, coronary heart disease, collagen tissue disease, high serum creatinine, and urinary infection, and who use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and were women were excluded from the study. A single void morning urine sample at the baseline examination was used to measure UAE. There were no significant differences in the age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking habits of the OSAS patients and controls. UAE of the OSAS group was significantly higher than that of the control group (23.3 +/- 6.1 microg/min vs. 6.5 +/- 2.1 microg/min, respectively; P = 0.002). UAE was positively correlated to length of time spent at an oxygen saturation of <90% (r = 0.503, P = 0.002) and BMI (r = 0.361, P = 0.033). Regression analyses (r (2) = 0.504, P < 0.0001) showed that the length of time spent at an oxygen saturation of <90% (P < 0.0001) was risk factor for UAE, independent of age and BMI. Our study supports the notion that low-grade UAE is associated with non-hypertensive/non-diabetic OSAS, independent of age and BMI. Low-grade UAE may be a marker for subclinical vascular damage that predisposes OSAS patients to future cardiovascular disease.", 
    "936": "Childhood chronic kidney disease commonly progresses toward end-stage renal failure, largely independent of the underlying disorder, once a critical impairment of renal function has occurred. Hypertension and proteinuria are the most important independent risk factors for renal disease progression. Therefore, current therapeutic strategies to prevent progression aim at controlling blood pressure and reducing urinary protein excretion. Renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) antagonists preserve kidney function not only by lowering blood pressure but also by their antiproteinuric, antifibrotic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Intensified blood pressure control, probably aiming for a target blood pressure below the 75th percentile, may exert additional renoprotective effects. Other factors contributing in a multifactorial manner to renal disease progression include dyslipidemia, anemia, and disorders of mineral metabolism. Measures to preserve renal function should therefore also comprise the maintenance of hemoglobin, serum lipid, and calcium-phosphorus ion product levels in the normal range.", 
    "937": "(Pro)renin receptor-bound prorenin not only causes the generation of angiotensin II via the nonproteolytic activation of prorenin, it also activates the receptor's own intracellular signaling pathways independent of the generated angiotensin II. Within the kidneys, the (pro)renin receptor is not only present in the glomerular mesangium, it is also abundant in podocytes, which play an important role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Recent in vivo studies have demonstrated that the overexpression of the (pro)renin receptor to a degree similar to that observed in hypertensive rat kidneys leads to slowly progressive nephropathy with proteinuria. In addition, the handle region peptide, which acts as a decoy peptide and competitively inhibits the binding of prorenin to the receptor, is more beneficial than an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with regard to alleviating proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis in experimental animal models of diabetes and essential hypertension. Thus, the (pro)renin receptor may be upregulated in podocytes under hypertensive conditions and may contribute to the breakdown of the glomerular filtration barrier.", 
    "938": "p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) inhibition exerts beneficial effects on left ventricular (LV) remodeling and dysfunction. p38 MAPK activity is transiently increased soon after myocardial infarction (MI), suggesting brief inhibition may afford the same benefit as long-term inhibition. We examined chronic 12-week p38 MAPK inhibition compared with short-term (7-day) inhibition, and then we discontinued inhibition after MI. Post-MI rats at day 7 received either vehicle, 4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(3-phenylpropyl)-5-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-3-butyn-1-ol (RWJ67657; RWJ) for 12 weeks (long term; LT-RWJ), RWJ for 1 week and discontinued for 11 weeks (1-week RWJ), or continuous ramipril for 12 weeks. In separate groups of animals, 24 h after MI, vehicle or RWJ was administered for 7 days. Cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and hemodynamic measurements. Percentage of fractional shortening improved after LT-RWJ and ramipril, but not after 1-week RWJ treatment. Likewise, LV contractility and maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt(max)) was improved (12.5 and 14.4%) and LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was reduced (49.4 and 54.6%) with both treatments. Functional outcomes were accompanied by regression of interstitial collagen I and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression in LV noninfarct, border, and infarct regions with LT-RWJ and ramipril treatment. Hypertrophy was reduced in noninfarct (18.3 and 12.2%) and border regions (16.3 and 12.0%) with both treatments, respectively. Animals receiving RWJ 24 h after MI for 7 days showed similar improvements in fractional shortening, dP/dt(max), LVEDP, including reduced fibrosis and hypertrophy. In vitro experiments confirmed a dose-dependent reduction in hypertrophy, with RWJ following tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulation. Continuous but not short-term p38 MAPK blockade attenuates post-MI remodeling, which is associated with functional benefits on the myocardium.", 
    "939": "To explore detrimental effects of advanced oxidation protein products-bovine serum albumin (BSA) on endothelial function and compare the favorable effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors: captopril and enalapril. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into groups: control, advanced oxidation protein products-BSA, captopril (10, 20 mg/kg/day), enalapril (15 mg/kg/day), and N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 300 mg/kg/day) plus captopril (20 mg/kg/day) groups. All animals were given advanced oxidation protein products-BSA (100 mg/kg/day, i.v.) except for control group (iv. equal volume of PBS). Rats in other groups were received different drugs intragastrically after advanced oxidation protein products-BSA administration. Endothelium-dependent relaxation of thoracic aorta was assayed. Content of nitrite/nitrate (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and of ACE in Sera, as well as renal function index including blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were measured. After 30 days, the endothelium-dependent relaxation of blood vessels in received advanced oxidation protein products-BSA rats was significantly impaired compared with control rats. The impairment was accompanied by decreases of serum NO, activity of GSH-Px and SOD. Administration of captopril and enalapril not only decreased damage of endothelium-dependent relaxation, but also reverse the changes of MDA levels, NO content and activity of SOD. The protective effect of captopril was abolished by L-NAME. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine had no significant differences between various groups. ACE activities were decreased in high captopril and enalapril groups, but did not significantly change in other groups. The results suggested that captopril and enalapril have similar effects on endothelial dysfunction induced by advanced oxidation protein products-BSA, which indicated that protective effects of captopril are not related to sulfhydryl group.", 
    "940": "The role of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in hypertension and end organ damage has long been recognized. Angiotensin 1 converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are superior to other antihypertensive agents in protecting the kidney against progressive deterioration, even in normotensive persons. Like ACEI, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AT1RA) ameliorate or even reverse glomerulosclerosis in rat animal models. These findings suggest that Angiotensin II (Ang II) has nonhemodynamic effects in progressive renal disease. The RAS is now recognized to be linked to induction of plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), possibly via the AT4 receptor, thus promoting both thrombosis and fibrosis. Interactions of the RAS with aldosterone and bradykinin may have an impact on both blood pressure and tissue injury. The beneficial effect on renal fibrosis of inhibiting the RAS likely reflects the central role that angiotensin has in regulating renal function and structure by its various actions. This article explores the interaction of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system with PAI-1, and the potential significance of these interactions in the pathogenesis of progressive renal disease and remodeling of renal sclerosis.",

Early follow-up was defined as patient- reported visits with a primary care physician or cardiologist within 1 month after discharge. The primary outcomes were use of aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins in eligible patients at 6 months. Multivariable analyses assessed the association between early follow-up and medication use at 6 months, adjusting for patient and clinical characteristics. Secondary analyses compared medication use at 6 months for patients receiving collaborative follow-up from a single provider vs those receiving follow-up from both provider types.",

    "948": "Angioedema is a self-limited nonpitting edema generally affecting the deeper layers of the skin and mucous membranes. It is the result of increased vascular permeability causing the leakage of fluid into the skin in response to potent vasodilators released by immunologic mediators. Two main pathways are thought to be implicated in angioedema. The mast cell pathway in which preformed mediators, such as histamine, rapidly formed mediators, leukotrienes and prostaglandins, are released from mast cells through IgE or direct activation. This is the most common pathway among children, with food, medications, and infections commonly implicated. The second pathway is the kinin pathway, most notably affected by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and hereditary forms of angioedema, which ultimately results in the formation of bradykinin, a potent vasodilator. Angioedema is being encountered with increasing frequency, particularly among children and is important to recognize and treat for its life-threatening associated manifestations such as anaphylaxis and airway obstruction. Although angioedema is still not fully understood, we have broadened our understanding of the possible causes and clinical course of angioedema. An understanding of these potential causes and mechanisms by which angioedema can occur may guide the clinician in determining the need for diagnostic testing and the extent of treatment.",

Exposure of intact endothelium rings preconstricted by PE or KCl to I. sonchifolia at concentration (20-160 g x L(-1) induced a significant constriction, which was inhibited by preincubation with captopril, but was not inhibited by preincubation with phosphoramidon or indomethacin. Exposure of endothelium-denuded rings preconstricted by PE or KCl to I. sonchifolia at concentration (10 to approximately 160 g x L(-1) did not effect the vasoconstriction.",

The effect of contraction may enhance angiotensin converting enzyme activity and promote endothelium to synthesize angiotensin II. It has no relationship to endothelin or thromboxane A2.", 
    "953": "The goal of this study was to elucidate the structure-activity relationship for vasodilating peptides and their underlying mechanism. In this study, we synthesized 62 di- and tri-peptides having aromatic amino acid residues (Tyr, Trp and Phe). Among them, only 4 peptides (HW, WH, WL and WV) evoked an apparent vasodilating effect in 50 mM KCl-contracted aortic rings in the descending order of WH>HW>WL>WV; WH showed the vasodilating activity with an EC50 of 3.4 mM. Within our experimental results, it seems likely that Trp residue at the N-terminal would play a role in eliciting vasodilating effect. No appearance of vasodilating effect for stereoisomers of WH with D-configuration revealed that the vessel would recognize the L-configuration of WH. The presence of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (50 nM enalaprilat) did not affect the WH-induced vasodilating effect, though WH showed a slight ACE inhibitory activity (IC50: 93 microM). The effect was also observed in the endothelium-denuded aortic rings. In contrast, WH provoked a significant displacement to the right in the vasodilating curve in the presence of 30 nM verapamil, while no shift was observed in the presence of 2.5 nM nifedipine. These results indicate that WH, a vasodilating di-peptide, would exert a vasodilation via the suppression of Ca2+ influx into KCl-induced depolarized aortic rings. The present study also suggests that the binding site of WH to the Ca2+ channel may be competitive to that of phenylalkylamine-type voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channel blocker.",

Five serious adverse events were reported (two in the 100 mug group, two in the 300 mug group, and one in the placebo group); none were deemed to be treatment related. Most side-effects were mild, transient reactions at the injection site. Mild, transient influenza-like symptoms were seen in three patients in the 100 mug group, seven in the 300 mug group, and none in the placebo group. In the 300 mug group, there was a reduction from baseline in mean ambulatory daytime blood pressure at week 14 by -9.0/-4.0 mm Hg compared with placebo (p=0.015 for systolic and 0.064 for diastolic).

We previously reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), -816A/C of the CES1A2 gene associates with the responsiveness to an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, imidapril, whose activity is achieved by CES1. To identify relevant functional polymorphisms, we re-sequenced the CES1A2 promoter region ( approximately 1kb) in 100 Japanese hypertensive patients. Altogether 10 SNPs and one insertion/deletion (I/D) were identified, among which seven SNPs and one I/D residing between -62 and -32 were in almost complete linkage disequilibrium (D'=1.00, r2=0.97). They consisted a minor and a major haplotype, the allele frequencies of which were 22% and 74%, respectively. The minor haplotype possessed two putative Sp1 binding sites while the major haplotype did not have any Sp1 binding site. The minor haplotype had a higher transcription and Sp1 binding activities than the major haplotype, invitro. The original -816A/C was in high linkage disequilibrium with these haplotypes (D'=0.92, r2=0.85), and well agreed with the efficacy of imidapril medication. These results suggest that the Sp1 binding site variation in the CES1A2 promoter is functional, and are good candidates for the pharmacogenetic studies of CES1-activated drugs.", 
    "960": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and currently has been estimated at 30% of the US population. Of these, only 36.8% have their blood pressure reduced to recommended levels of lower than 140/90 mmHg for uncomplicated hypertension, or less than 130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or renal disease. Since monotherapy controls blood pressure in less than 50% of treated hypertensive patients, combination therapy is often required to bring blood pressure to the recommended levels of the 7th Joint National Committee report. One of the most effective and widely used combinations is the combination of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Aliskiren, a new blocker of the renin-angiotensin system has been developed and approved by the US FDA on 18th January 2008 for the treatment of hypertension. Aliskiren is a direct inhibitor of renin, the rate-limiting enzyme for the production of angiotensin II, a powerful vasoconstrictive peptide. Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that aliskiren administered in single daily doses of 150, 300 or 600 mg alone and in combination with HCTZ 12.5 and 25 mg is effective in lowering blood pressure, and is safe and well tolerated.

Hypertension frequently clusters with other cardiometabolic risk factors, such as dysglycemia, low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglyceride levels. These, along with other factors such as central obesity, increased inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and thrombosis, are components of the metabolic syndrome. All guidelines recommend that the first-line therapy in metabolic syndrome should be based on lifestyle modification, consisting of diet and moderate exercise for at least 30 min/day. Concerning drug treatment of hypertension associated with other cardiometabolic risk factors, many results of head-to-head studies have demonstrated a reduction in new-onset Type 2 diabetes in hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, when compared with conventional antihypertensive therapy. The explanations of the different actions of both these drugs include several mechanisms related to pancreatic insulin release and insulin sensitivity improvement. Another mechanism by which the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system may improve insulin sensitivity is through the partial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonism of telmisartan. For that reason, telmisartan has been considered by some experts to be an antihypertensive agent that is particularly useful in the treatment of hypertension associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. The impact of the promising metabolic action exhibited by telmisartan on the outcome of hypertensive patients aggregating other cardiometabolic risk factors waits for adequately randomized and powered clinical trials.",

During incubation with angiotensin I, the highest angiotensin II levels were observed in sera with the highest ACE activity. This confirms that ACE is rate-limiting with regard to angiotensin II generation. C-domain-selective concentrations of quinaprilat fully blocked angiotensin I-II conversion in DDs, whereas additional N-domain blockade was required to fully block conversion in IIs. Both domains contributed to bradykinin hydrolysis in all subjects, and the inhibition profile of RXP407 when using Mca-Ala was identical in IIs and DDs. In contrast, the RXPA380 concentrations required to block C-domain activity when using Mca-BK (1-8) were three-fold higher in IIs than DDs.", 
    "976": "The contributions of the C-domain and N-domain differ between DDs and IIs, and RXPA380 is the first inhibitor capable of distinguishing D-allele ACE from I-allele ACE. The lack of angiotensin II accumulation in DDs in vivo is not because of the often quoted concept that ACE is a nonrate-limiting enzyme. It may relate to the fact that in IIs both the N-domain and C- domain generate angiotensin II, whereas in DDs only the C-domain converts angiotensin I.",

The most potent inhibitor in this series is a tripeptide that displays a K i value of 0.4 nM toward ACE2 and is 3 orders of magnitude less potent toward carboxypeptidase A. Phosphinic tripeptides exhibit high potency exclusively when the Xaa position is occupied by a pseudoproline.

    "1000": "Chronic kidney disease is generally thought to be a progressive disorder regardless of etiology. Over the past 15 years, investigations into the mechanisms of disease progression and treatment designed to slow or halt disease progression have been conducted, largely in the adult kidney disease population. Intervention trials have demonstrated that lowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients and administration of drugs that block the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system are effective at slowing kidney disease progression, including diabetes, hypertension, and various glomerular diseases. In addition, novel strategies including anemia therapy with erythropoietin-stimulating agents have been conducted to determine whether treatment of this common complication of kidney disease can stabilize kidney function. Whereas substantial success has been achieved in more common forms of adult kidney disease such as diabetes and hypertension, slowing progression of some immune-mediated glomerular disease such as lupus nephritis and immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy remain a great challenge. Moreover, there is no proven strategy, including multifactorial interventions, that clearly halts progressive chronic kidney disease that has been studied prospectively in a large-scale, long-term trial.

    "1017": "Lifestyle changes (smoking, alcohol intake, diet, exercise) and cardiac rehabilitation play an important part in reducing risk of recurrent events. In patients with a history of MI and/or those who underwent myocardial revascularisation these have to be supplemented with medication. Several pharmacological agents are known to improve prognosis in these patients, i.e. beta-blockers, antiplatelet agents, statins, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi). The present article focuses mainly on the role of ACEi in the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with a history of MI or myocardial revascularization.", 
    "1018": "Many treatment modalities have been developed over the years for the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). While they are still considered the first line of treatment for suppression of AF, antiarrhythmics often lead to treatment failure, complications and undesired consequences. Pulmonary vein ablation is an invasive procedure which is not always curative. Recently, there have been a variety of studies reporting the potential antiarrhythmic effects of various nonantiarrhythmic agents. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the findings reported thus far about the antiarrhythmic effects of agents which are not antiarrhythmic drugs themselves, but which have been found to offer promise in the prevention and treatment of AF.", 
    "1019": "Diabetes mellitus is an exploding epidemic costing billions of dollars yearly. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is characterized by insulin resistance and is closely associated with arterial hypertension. Emerging literature has demonstrated that modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers leads to improved insulin sensitivity, glycemic control and possibly prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.", 
    "1020": "Several major studies investigating angiotensin II receptor blocker or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use in either hypertensive or heart failure patients have found lower incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared with placebo, beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker or diuretic. None of these trials, however, studied prevention of diabetes as a primary endpoint. The Dream Trial and upcoming NAVIGATOR, ONTARGET/TRANSCEND trials specifically look at the prevention of diabetes as a primary endpoint. Several studies have evaluated possible mechanisms of how the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can alter insulin sensitivity and glycemic control.", 
    "1021": "This review will focus on the recent literature that demonstrates renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and its effects on diabetes prevention, glycemic control and insulin sensitivity, as well as possible mechanisms for achieving this goal.", 
    "1022": "Novel pentapeptides called Thrombostatin FM compounds consisting mostly of D-isomers and unusual amino acids were prepared based upon the stable angiotensin converting enzyme breakdown product of bradykinin - RPPGF.", 
    "1023": "These peptides are direct thrombin inhibitors prolonging the thrombin clotting time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time at >or=0.78, 1.6, and 1.6 microm, respectively. They competitively inhibit alpha-thrombin-induced cleavage of a chromogenic substrate at 4.4-8.2 microm. They do not significantly inhibit plasma kallikrein, factor (F) XIIa, FXIa, FIXa, FVIIa-TF, FXa, plasmin or cathepsin G. One form, FM19 [rOicPaF(p-Me)], blocks alpha-thrombin-induced calcium flux in fibroblasts with an IC(50) of 6.9 +/- 1.2 microm. FM19 achieved 100% inhibition of threshold alpha- or gamma-thrombin-induced platelet aggregation at 8.4 +/- 4.7 microm and 16 +/- 4 microm, respectively. The crystal structure of thrombin in complex with FM19 shows that the N-terminal D-Arg retrobinds into the S1 pocket, its second residue Oic interacts with His-57, Tyr-60a and Trp-60d, and its C-terminal p-methyl Phe engages thrombin's aryl binding site composed of Ile-174, Trp-215, and Leu-99. When administered intraperitoneal, intraduodenal, or orally to mice, FM19 prolongs thrombin clotting times and delays carotid artery thrombosis.", 
    "1024": "FM19, a low affinity reversible direct thrombin inhibitor, might be useful as an add-on agent to address an unmet need in platelet inhibition in acute coronary syndromes in diabetics and others who with all current antiplatelet therapy still have reactive platelets.", 
    "1025": "Approximately 5 million people in the United States have heart failure. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that at least one half of patients who have clinically overt heart failure have diastolic heart failure (DHF), or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. DHF is characterized by concentric remodeling with normal left ventricular end-diastolic volume, abnormalities of active relaxation, and increased passive ventricular stiffness. Diuretics are an essential component of therapy for most patients who have DHF, and treatment of hypertension is a cornerstone of therapy designed to prevent or to treat DHF. Several antihypertensive agents have been shown to effectively reduce wave reflection, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium antagonists, and nitrates. Lifestyle changes may also be helpful.", 
    "1026": "Six kinds of chitooligosaccharides (COSs) with different molecular weight (MW) and degree of deacetylation (DD) were prepared using ultrafiltration membrane reactor, and their renin inhibition modes were evaluated. All the COSs showed the renin-inhibitory activities with dose-dependent manner, and 90-COSs had the potent renin-inhibitory activity than that of 50-COSs. Among them, 90-MMWCOS (1000-5000Da) exhibits the highest activity with IC(50) value of 0.51mg/mL and acts as competitive inhibitor with K(i) value of 0.28mg/mL by Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots. These results indicated that DD value and MW of COSs are important factors affecting renin-inhibitory activity."
