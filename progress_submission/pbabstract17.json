    "7": "The protective effect of rutin on the glomerulosclerosis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in rat mesangial cells was investigated. The cultured mesangial cells were divided into eight groups: normal, solvent control, high glucose, low dose of rutin, moderate dose of rutin, high dose of rutin, captopril and Ginkgo biloba extract. The cell cycles, type IV collagen and laminin in cytoplasm, TGF-\u03b2\u2081 mRNA of mesangial cells, Smad 2/3 and Smad 7, and the activities of four antioxidant indexes including T-SOD, MDA, CAT and GSH-Px were measured by flow cytometry, radioimmunoassay, RT-PCR, western blotting and visible spectrophotometry, respectively. Compared with the high glucose group, rutin decreased the cell percentages of the G\u2080/G\u2081 phase and inhibited the expression of Smad 2/3, laminin and type IV collagen, and TGF-\u03b2\u2081 mRNA level, significantly. The antioxidant capacity, the cell percentages of S phase and Smad 7 expression were significantly increased by rutin.

    "12": "This study aimed to assess the role of cAMP target sequences enhancer cAMP response element (enhCRE) and cAMP and overlapping negative response element (CNRE) in the control of human renin gene (REN) in vivo. enhCRE and CNRE were silenced by mutations in a 12.2-kb human renin promoter fused to LacZ reporter gene. This construct was used to generate transgenic mice (RENMut-LacZ). The expression of the transgene was correctly targeted to the juxtaglomerular portions of renal afferent arterioles which express endogenous mouse renin. Therefore, enhCRE and CNRE do not seem to be relevant for the control of the cell-specific expression of the human renin gene. The \u03b2-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol (10\u00a0mg/kg/day, for 2\u00a0days) stimulated the endogenous renin, but not the LacZ mRNA expression. Treatment of RENMut-LacZ mice with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril 10\u00a0mg/kg/day, for 7\u00a0days) or their crossing to angiotensin receptor type 1a knockout mice led to increased renin and LacZ mRNA levels. Renin expression was upregulated by low-salt diet (0.03% NaCl, for 10\u00a0days) and downregulated by high-salt diet (4% NaCl, for 10\u00a0days). In contrast, low-salt diet did not influence, while high-salt diet inhibited the expression of LacZ. In summary, enhCRE and CNRE appear to be necessary for the transactivation of the human renin gene through \u03b2-adrenoreceptors and by low-salt diet. Our data also suggest that different intracellular mechanisms mediate the effect of low- and high-salt intake on renin expression in vivo.", 
    "13": "Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) involves considerable histological heterogeneity in terms of location and quality of the glomerular segmental lesions. The present study investigated the heterogeneity of segmental lesions in each variant of FSGS, determined by the Columbia classification, and its clinical relevance. All glomerular segmental lesions of 80 cases of primary FSGS were evaluated histologically based on location [tip (TIP), perihilar (PH), or not otherwise specified (NOS)], and quality (cellular or fibrous). Among the 1,299 glomeruli of the 80 biopsy specimens, 210 glomeruli (16.2%) had segmental lesions, comprising 57 (27%) cellular TIP, 4 (2%) fibrous TIP, 42 (20%) cellular NOS, 86 (41%) fibrous NOS, and 21 (10%) fibrous PH lesions. Each case was also classified into one of the five histological variants of the Columbia classification: collapsing (COL), TIP, cellular (CEL), PH, or NOS. Overlap of segmental lesions in different location categories was seen in the COL, TIP, and PH variants, and heterogeneity of quality was apparent in the COL and CEL variants. Histological findings of the CEL variant (endocapillary hypercellularity) were observed in nine of the 13 COL variants. Both location and quality correlated with disease duration, degree of proteinuria, and histological severity of global glomerular sclerosis and tubulo-interstitial lesions. These results demonstrated the histological heterogeneity of glomerular segmental lesions in all variants of the Columbia classification, except NOS. However, the fidelity of location and dominance of histological features were generally conserved in the TIP and PH variants. The COL and CEL variants warrant further investigation because of their overlapping histological findings and apparent histological heterogeneity in the glomerular segmental lesions.", 
    "14": "Heart failure can be caused by pro-hypertrophic humoral factors such as angiotensin II (Ang II), which regulates protein kinase activities. The intermingled responses of these kinases lead to the early compensated cardiac hypertrophy, but later to the uncompensated phase of heart failure. We have shown that although beneficial, cardiac hypertrophy is associated with modifications in ion channels that are mainly mediated through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. This study evaluates the control of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) by the Ang II/PI3K pathway in hypertrophied ventricular myocytes from volume-overload rats using the perforated patch-clamp technique. To assess activation of the I(Ca,L) in cardiomyocytes, voltages of 350 ms in 10 mV increments from a holding potential of -85 mV were applied to cardiocytes, with a pre-pulse to -45 mV for 300 ms. Volume overload-induced hypertrophy reduces I(Ca,L), whereas addition of Ang II alleviates the hypertrophic-induced decrease in a PI3K-dependent manner. Acute administration of Ang II (10(-6) mol/L) to normal adult cardiomyocytes had no effect; however, captopril reduced their basal I(Ca,L). In parallel, captopril regressed the hypertrophy and inverted the Ang II effect on I(Ca,L) seemingly through a PI3K upstream effector. Thus, it seems that regression of cardiac hypertrophy by captopril improved I(Ca,L) partly through PI3K.", 
    "15": "Angiotensin II can induce cardiac hypertrophy by stimulating the release of growth factors. ACE inhibitors reduce angiotensin II levels and cardiac hypertrophy, but their effects on the healthy heart are largely unexplored. We hypothesized that ACE inhibition decreases left ventricular mass in normotensive animals and that this is associated with altered expression of cardiac fetal genes, growth factors, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Wistar rats (n = 7 per group) were orally administered with enalapril twice daily for a total daily dose of 5 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1) (ENAP5) or 15 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1) (ENAP15) or vehicle. Systolic blood pressure was measured by the tail-cuff method. Left ventricular expression of cardiac myosin heavy chain-\u03b1 (MYH6) and -\u03b2 (MYH7), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), endothelin-1 (ET-1), transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 (TGF\u03b2-1), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and renal renin were examined by real-time PCR, and eNOS using Western blot. Blood pressure was decreased only in ENAP15 animals (p < 0.05 vs. Control), whereas left ventricular mass decreased after both doses of enalapril (p < 0.05 vs. Control). MYH7 and ANP were reduced in ENAP15, while no changes in ET-1, TGF\u03b2-1, CT-1, and MYH6 mRNA or eNOS protein were observed. Renal renin dose-dependently increased after enalapril treatment. Enalapril significantly decreased left ventricular mass even after 1 week treatment in the normotensive rat. This was associated with a decreased expression of the fetal genes MYH7 and ANP, but not expression of ET-1, CT-1, or TGF\u03b2-1.", 
    "16": "Despite the theoretical benefits, angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists seem to enhance rather than reduce morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. This may result from unopposed angiotensin II type 2 receptor stimulation, which is associated with enhanced apoptotic cell death and increased infarct size. We studied whether the clinical effectiveness of irbesartan is hampered by enhanced apoptotic activity, detected by exposition of phosphatidylserines, during ischemia and reperfusion in humans in vivo. Twenty healthy male volunteers were randomized to a 1-week treatment with irbesartan (300 mg/d) or placebo in a double-blind fashion. After treatment, all participants underwent 10 minutes of ischemic exercise of the nondominant forearm. Upon reperfusion, Tc-99m-labeled Annexin A5 was administered, and 1 and 4 hours afterward, both hands were scanned using a gamma camera. Targeting of annexin A5, expressed as the percentage difference in radioactivity in the area of interest (thenar muscle) between experimental and control hand, did not differ between participants treated with irbesartan or placebo. Therefore, irbesartan does not enhance phosphatidylserine exposition in humans in vivo. The results of this study do not support enhanced apoptotic activity after treatment with irbesartan in a setting of ischemia and reperfusion.",

    "20": "This study suggests that although there are some racial and ethnic disparities in the receipt of pharmacological therapy for CHF among TRICARE beneficiaries, these differences do not translate into disparities in the likelihood of a PAH.

    "21": "Angiotensin (Ang) I-converting enzyme (ACE) is involved in the control of blood pressure by catalyzing the conversion of Ang I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II and degrading the vasodilator peptide bradykinin. Human ACE also functions as a signal transduction molecule, and the binding of ACE substrates or its inhibitors initiates a series of events. In this study, we examined whether Ang II could bind to ACE generating calcium signaling. Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with an ACE expression vector reveal that Ang II is able to bind with high affinity to ACE in the absence of the Ang II type 1 and type 2 receptors and to activate intracellular signaling pathways, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and calcium. These effects could be blocked by the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril. Calcium mobilization was specific for Ang II, because other ACE substrates or products, namely Ang 1-7, bradykinin, bradykinin 1-5, and N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline, did not trigger this signaling pathway. Moreover, in Tm5, a mouse melanoma cell line endogenously expressing ACE but not Ang II type 1 or type 2 receptors, Ang II increased intracellular calcium and reactive oxygen species. In conclusion, we describe for the first time that Ang II can interact with ACE and evoke calcium and other signaling molecules in cells expressing only ACE. These findings uncover a new mechanism of Ang II action and have implications for the understanding of the renin-Ang system.",

    "26": "The present study examined whether (1) the cough associated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy is attenuated by oral intake of iron and anti-oxidants, and (2) nitric oxide (NO) has any role in this attenuation. Of the 100 patients under investigation, cough occurred in 28 of them with preponderance in females. All the 28 patients were followed up for six weeks: the first two weeks were the observation period and the remaining four weeks the experimentation period. After the observation period, 11 patients received a single oral dose of ferrous sulphate (200 mg), eight received vitamin E (200 mg, o.d.) and vitamin C (150 mg, o.d.) and nine were given placebo during the experimentation period. Cough scoring, serum NO and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined during both the periods. While there were significant decreases in cough scores, NO and MDA levels between these two periods in the iron group, cough scores and MDA level decreased significantly in the anti-oxidant group. None of these parameters changed in the control group. NO level was found to be increased significantly in patients who developed cough (n = 28) compared with those who did not cough (n = 72). These results suggest that iron supplementation suppresses cough in patients on ACE-I therapy through its effect on NO generation.",

    "30": "Addition of the telmisartan to trandolapril was more effective in reducing renal structural changes and improvement of renal function than monotherapy with either drug, possibly due to dual inhibitory effect on the renin- angiotensin system, and thus suppression of TGF-\u03b21, TNF-\u03b1.", 
    "31": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing diagnostic procedures and/or interventional procedures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use has been implicated both as increasing the risk of developing CIN and as a protective factor against developing CIN. Because many patients who are referred for cardiac catheterization have comorbidities for which ACEIs are utilized, the precise role of these medications in the pathogenesis of CIN needs to be clarified. There is evidence both for and against a renoprotective effect of ACEIs in the development of CIN. However, virtually all clinical studies are relatively small studies and most of them are retrospective. Because of the important role that ACEIs play in the chronic treatment of the cardiac patient, further studies are warranted to define the role of the ACEIs in CIN when exposure to contrast is needed in this group of patients. Because CIN is an independent risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in the cardiac patient, all efforts to decrease its incidence should be pursued. At the present time there is no compelling evidence for starting or stopping ACEIs before cardiac catheterization/coronary angiography or coronary intervention.", 
    "32": "Traditional uses of Achillea millefolium L. (Asteraceae) include the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, we used anesthetized rats to assess the hypotensive effect of a hydroethanolic extract (HEAM), and its dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), butanolic (BT), and dichloromethane-2 (DCM-2) fractions, besides the flavonoid artemetin, isolated from A. millefolium. The oral administration of HEAM (100-300 mg/kg), DCM (20mg/kg), DCM-2 (10-30 mg/kg), but not EA (10 mg/kg) and BT (50 mg/kg) fractions significantly reduced the mean arterial pressure (MAP) of normotensive rats. The phytochemical analysis by NMR (1)H of DCM and DCM-2 fractions revealed high amounts of artemetin, that was isolated and administered by either oral (1.5 mg/kg) or intravenous (0.15-1.5 mg/kg) routes in rats. This flavonoid was able to dose-dependently reduce the MAP, up to 11.47 \u00b1 1.5 mmHg (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.). To investigate if artemetin-induced hypotension was related to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, we evaluated the influence of this flavonoid on the vascular effects of both angiotensin I and bradykinin. Intravenous injection of artemetin (0.75 mg/kg) significantly reduced the hypertensive response to angiotensin I while increased the average length of bradykinin-induced hypotension. Artemetin (1.5 mg/kg, p.o.) was also able to reduce plasma (about 37%) and vascular (up to 63%) ACE activity in vitro, compared to control group. On the other hand, artemetin did not change angiotensin II-induced hypertension. Our study is the first showing the hypotensive effects induced by the extract and fractions obtained from A. millefollium. In addition, our results disclosed that this effect may be, at least in part, associated with high levels of artemetin and its ability to decrease angiotensin II generation in vivo, by ACE inhibition.", 
    "33": "Prostate carcinoma frequently metastasizes to bone where the microenvironment facilitates its growth. Inhibition of bone resorption is effective in reducing tumor burden and bone destruction in prostate cancer. However, whether drugs that inhibit osteoclast function inhibit tumor growth independent of inhibition of bone resorption is unclear. Calcium is released during bone resorption and the calcium sensing receptor is an important regulator of cancer cell proliferation. The goal of this investigation was to elucidate the role of calcium released during bone resorption and to determine the impact of drugs which suppress bone resorption on tumor growth in bone. To compare tumor growth in a skeletal versus non-skeletal site, equal numbers of canine prostate cancer cells expressing luciferase (ACE-1(luc)) were inoculated into a simple collagen matrix, neonatal mouse vertebrae (vossicles), human de-proteinized bone, or a mineralized collagen matrix. Implants were placed subcutaneously into athymic mice. Luciferase activity was used to track tumor growth weekly, and at one month tumors were dissected for histologic analysis. Luciferase activity and tumor size were greater in vossicles, de-proteinized bone and mineralized collagen matrix versus non-mineralized collagen implants. The human osteoblastic prostate carcinoma cell line C4-2b also grew better in a mineral rich environment with a greater proliferation of C4-2b cells reflected by Ki-67 staining. Zoledronic acid (ZA), a bisphosphonate, and recombinant OPG-Fc, a RANKL inhibitor, were administered to mice bearing vertebral implants (vossicles) containing ACE-1 osteoblastic prostate cancer cells. Vossicles or collagen matrices were seeded with ACE-1(luc) cells subcutaneously in athymic mice (2 vossicles, 2 collagen implants/mouse). Mice received ZA (5 \u03bcg/mouse, twice/week), (OPG-Fc at 10mg/kg, 3 times/week) or vehicle, and luciferase activity was measured weekly. Histologic analysis of the tumors, vossicles and endogenous bones and serum biochemistry were performed. Antiresorptive administration was associated with decreased serum TRAP5b, reduced osteoclast numbers, and increased tibia and vossicle bone areas. ZA significantly decreased bone marrow calcium concentrations without affecting serum calcium. ZA and OPG-Fc significantly inhibited tumor growth in bone but not in collagen implants. In conclusion, the inhibitory effects of ZA or OPG-Fc on prostate tumor growth in bone are mediated via blocking bone resorption and calcium release from bone.",

    "43": "Diabetes mellitus is characterized by hyperglycemia, which induces oxidative stress and perturbs a number of pathways, leading to tissue injury. One of the pathological responses to tissue injury is the development of fibrosis and cell death. Enalapril is a non-thiol angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that is commonly used in the treatment of diabetes-associated hypertension. The present study examines the possible beneficial effects of enalapril on the development of diabetes associated fibrosis and DNA damage in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats (250 \u00b1 10 g) were used in the study. Enalapril (10 mg kg(-1) per oral) was administered for four consecutive weeks to the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. After 4 weeks, all the animals were sacrificed and comet assay (normal and modified) was performed to detect the normal as well as oxidative DNA damage. Expression of profibrotic marker CCN2 and fibrosis was examined in the heart, kidney and liver of diabetic rats. Enalapril treatment significantly restored the malondialdehyde and glutathione content as well as the DNA damage in the heart, kidney and liver of diabetic rat. Significant decrease in the expression of CCN2 was observed in the heart, kidney and liver of diabetic rat receiving enalapril treatment as compared with the diabetic group. Further, the enalapril treatment led to significant decrease in the fibrosis and CCN2 expression in the diabetic group as compared with control. The results of the present study clearly demonstrate that enalapril ameliorates the DNA damage, cell death and expression of CCN2 in the heart, kidney and liver of the STZ-induced diabetic rat.",

Specifically, individuals with genetic variation in regions central to mediation of beneficial response to standard heart failure agents may not receive optimal benefit from these drugs. Additionally, targeted approaches in phase 3 clinical trials that select patients for inclusion based on the genotype most likely to respond might advance the currently stalled drug development pipeline in heart failure. This article reviews the literature in heart failure pharmacogenetics to date, opportunities for discovery in recent and upcoming clinical trials, as well as future directions in this field.", 
    "45": "Reducing the excessive accumulation of amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a key objective of most AD therapies. Several studies suggest that pharmacological inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or its by-product angiotensin II may delay onset or progression of dementia and it has been suggested that this occurs via regulation of A\u03b2. Intraneuronal oligomeric accumulation of A\u03b2 is postulated to be one of the earliest pathological events. Thus this study investigated the effect of an ACE-inhibitor, captopril, and two angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), eprosartan and valsartan, on intraneuronal A\u03b2 pathology and oligomeric A\u03b2 levels in a triple transgenic (3xTGAD) mouse model of AD.",

Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was measured at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 2 months when the mice were sacrificed and the brains hemisected for analysis. One hemisphere was processed for A\u03b2 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunohistochemistry and the other for biochemical measurement of oligomeric A\u03b2 and APP.

In this context, we reviewed published studies related to the efficacy and efficiency of starting combination antihypertensive treatment versus mono-therapy. The overall evidence supports that initial combination therapy is more effective for many outcomes (ie, reaching blood pressure targets, rapidity of control, patient adherence, and cardiovascular protection assessed by surrogate markers). The few available published clinical trials and observational studies support that the amlodipine + an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor combination may be the most effective for reducing cardiovascular events. We outline a novel algorithm of starting initial therapy with a single tablet containing amlodipine + benazepril in most patients with hypertension regardless of stage or comorbidities. It is our hypothesis that this streamlined approach is likely to yield an overall positive risk/benefit ratio and that it should be tested in an outcome trial versus accepted monotherapies in stage I hypertension.",

    "68": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is characterized by the destruction of tissue architecture due to chronic inflammation of unknown etiology. Recent studies have indicated that control of inflammation is a promising therapeutic strategy; however, no established pharmacological intervention is currently available for AAA. We found that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was expressed in aneurysmal tissue, and colocalized with von Willebrand factor, the endothelial cell marker, in the most damaged part of the aneurysmal walls. In ex vivo cultures of human AAA tissue, exogenously added HGF in the presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) enhanced the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, imidaprilat and perindoprilat, enhanced the secretion of endogenous HGF, augmented the TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-10 secretion and suppressed MCP-1 secretion from AAA tissue. The ACE inhibitors also augmented the expression of HGF in the presence of bradykinin in human aortic endothelial cells in culture (HAECs). In contrast, HGF secretion was not affected by either an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonist or angiotensin II in AAA tissue or in HAECs. These results suggested that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful in controlling chronic inflammation in AAA, partly due to their enhancement of HGF secretion.",

Patients with atherosclerosis and hypertension are randomly assigned to receive lisinopril 10 to 20 mg/d or lisinopril 10 to 20 mg/d plus simvastatin 20 mg/d for 24 weeks. Higher arginase activity is observed in erythrocytes from 100% of patients and mainly recovered after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment with lisinopril or lisinopril + simvastatin.

    "79": "The increasing burden on health care providers from chronic kidney disease (CKD) is due to the escalating prevalence of obesity, hypertension and type 2 diabetes. The gradual decline in kidney function in the presence of these risk factors is also associated with increased cardiovascular disease. Excess angiotensin II production by the renin-angiotensin system is responsible, at least in part, for development of hypertension and for damage in the kidneys and the cardiovascular system. Pharmacological targeting of the renin-angiotensin system not only reduces blood pressure, but may also provides more direct vascular protection. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are better tolerated than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and, thus, may be a more practical therapeutic option. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of irbesartan, losartan, telmisartan and valsartan in the management of CKD. All ARBs tested to date have proved effective in improving at least some aspects of renal dysfunction. Few within-class comparative studies exist. Telmisartan provides superior reductions in proteinuria to losartan, however, even when blood pressures are equalized with concomitant antihypertensives. This superiority is probably linked to higher receptor affinity, longer plasma half-life and higher lipophilicity of telmisartan compared with other ARBs. The reduction of proteinuria with ARBs is also linked to improved cardiovascular outcomes. After a decade of research, there is now substantial evidence to show that the use of ARBs provides an efficacious treatment option for the prevention of renal disease progression in patients with hypertension and/or diabetes.", 
    "80": "Under common practice, treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is usually initiated at late stage of CKD due to the insensitiveness of the available diagnostic markers. Such treatment fails to restore renal perfusion and function. This is due to the defective mechanism of vascular homeostasis and impaired nitric oxide production observed in late stage of DN. In contrast, the mechanism of vascular repair is adequately functional in early stage of DN (normoalbuminuria). In this study, we treated 50 normoalbuminuric diabetic patients with multidrug vasodilators, namely ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, \u00b1 calcium channel blocker in conjunction with correction of metabolic disorders for 24-36 months. Following the treatment, increment in peritubular capillary flow in response to vasodilators was observed, and thus supports the adequate role of vascular repair. In addition, increase in renal function documented in this study also implies that an effective preventive strategy to minimize end-stage renal disease can be accomplished in normoalbuminuric DN.",

Until now only administration of a purified C1-inhibitor extract was effective against these symptoms.

This report describes a case of a renal artery stenosis confirmed by multidetector computed tomographic angiography.", 
    "83": "Numerous studies have documented the association between endothelial dysfunction and adverse cardiovascular events. For example, coronary artery disease is associated with functional and structural changes of the coronary arteries, resulting in ischemia or plaque rupture, and is highly associated with endothelial dysfunction. Recent data suggest that implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES) can induce coronary artery endothelial dysfunction at follow-up when compared with bare-metal stents (BMS) and that this endothelial dysfunction may be associated with late stent thrombosis. Indeed, despite the superiority of DES in preventing restenosis, the incidence of death and myocardial infarction is similar when comparing DES with BMS. Medical treatment, such as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers, can improve endothelial dysfunction. Thus, administration of these drugs along with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be a low-risk strategy to provide therapeutic benefit by stabilizing unstable plaque or by suppressing new lesion formation in patients undergoing PCI.", 
    "84": "A simple, sensitive, and rapid chemiluminescence method combined with flow-injection analysis was developed for the determination of lisinopril. It was found that the chemiluminescence (CL) signal arising from the reaction of alkaline luminol with KMnO(4) could be significantly increased by addition of lisinopril in the presence of silver nanoparticles. The experimental parameters affecting the chemiluminescence reaction were carefully studied and the chemiluminescence reaction mechanism was briefly discussed. Under the selected conditions, the chemiluminescence intensity was proportional to the concentration of lisinopril ranging from 0.1 mg/L to 20.0 mg/L. The detection limit was 0.027 mg/L lisinopril and the relative standard deviation for 4.0 mg/L lisinopril solution was 1.9% over eleven repeated measurements. The proposed method was applied to the determination of lisinopril in tablets and spiked human urine samples.", 
    "85": "Angiotensin II (Ang-II) plays a role not only as a vasoconstrictor in controlling blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis, but also as a mitogenic factor through the Ang-II type-1 (AT1) receptor in cardiovascular cells. Since a low prevalence of cancer in hypertensive patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been reported, the molecular mechanisms of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in cancer cells have been elucidated. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that the RAS is implicated in the development of prostate cancer. As previously reported, AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), a class of antihypertensive agent, have the potential to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells and tumors through the AT1 receptor. This review highlights that the RAS plays a potential role in various aspects of prostate cancer, and ARBs could be useful for treatment of prostate cancer or its chemoprevention.", 
    "86": "Recent studies have shown an activation of the local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in various tumor tissues, including the abundant generation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and the upregulation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) expression. Thus, considerable attention has been paid not only to the role of the RAS in cancer progression, but also to the blockade of RAS as a new approach to the treatment of human cancer. There is increasing evidence that the Ang II-AT1R pathway is involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis in various experimental animal models, suggesting the therapeutic potential of an ACE inhibitor and AT1R blocker. In addition, specific Ang II-degrading enzymes are also expressed in tumors and play a regulatory role in tumor cell proliferation and invasion. This review focuses on the role of the RAS in the progression of gynecologic cancers, such as cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, and gestational choriocarcinoma. We present here the clinical potential of blocking the RAS as a novel and promising strategy for the treatment of gynecologic cancers.", 
    "87": "Angiotensin II (Ang II), a main effector peptide of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), mediates a hormonal action in the maintenance of blood pressure and electrolyte levels, and thus fluid homeostasis. Ang II also mediates paracrine, autocrine and/or intracrine actions in the control of various specific functions of diverse tissue organs. In the pancreas, Ang II exerts a growth promoting, angiogenic influence via the mediation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Recent studies have implicated inappropriate activation of the local RAS in pancreatic cancer, including upregulation of AT1R and the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which consequently enhance Ang II-induced tumour activity. In addition to acting in a classical antihypertensive capacity, RAS blockers (AT1R blockers or ACE inhibitors) may yield protective effects against pancreatic cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy that is intrinsically resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Substantial experimental data from studies using cell and animal models of pancreatic cancer support the notion that RAS regulates tumour growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis; and a convergence of such findings suggests that pharmacological RAS blockade could have therapeutic potential in the management of pancreatic cancer. This review critically appraises the current research progress on the role of RAS in pancreatic cancer, and discusses the potential for developing drugs that target RAS for treatment of pancreatic cancer.", 
    "88": "Angiogenesis is a complex and critical process essential for supporting the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as hepatocarcinogenesis. Recent studies have revealed that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is involved in many types of cancer including HCC. Some studies have proven that suppression of angiotensin-II (AT-II) by a clinically used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) significantly attenuated the HCC growth and hepatocarcinogenesis along with down-regulation of a potent angiogenic factor; namely, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). When used in combination with the clinical available drugs such as interferon (IFN) and vitamin K (VK), ACE-I exerted more potent anti-tumor activities as compared with either single agent in addition to suppression of the intra-tumoral angiogenesis both in experimental models and clinical practice. It is well known that AT-II plays an important role in the insulin resistance (IR), and IR is reportedly involved in the progression of HCC. The combination of ACE-I and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) exerted a marked chemopreventive effect against HCC under the condition of IR. In addition to AT-II, aldosterone (Ald), which plays a role in the downstream of AT-II, is also involved in the HCC development, and a clinically used selective Ald blocker (SAB) significantly suppressed the HCC growth and hepatocarcinogenesis. Since ACE-I, IFN, VK, BCAA, and SAB are already in widespread clinical use without any serious adverse effects, they may represent a potential new strategy for cancer therapy and chemoprevention against HCC especially in combination with other angiostatic agents.", 
    "89": "Upregulation of vascular B(1) kinin receptor expression has been reported in human atheroma, but its role remains unclear. We examined vasomotor and fibrinolytic responses to selective B(1) and B(2) kinin receptor agonism in the human femoral circulation and correlated responses with femoral arterial plaque load. Femoral arterial cross-sectional area, blood flow and plaque volume were determined using intravascular ultrasound and Doppler during selective arterial infusion of Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin (B(1) agonist), bradykinin (B(2) agonist) and sodium nitroprusside in eleven patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography. Net release of tissue plasminogen activator was determined across the femoral vascular bed. Mean femoral arterial plaque load was 8.1 (\u00b10.9)\u00a0mm(3)/mm of vessel. Bradykinin and sodium nitroprusside caused dose-dependent increases in femoral blood flow (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.005, respectively). Bradykinin caused a dose-dependent increase in net tissue plasminogen activator release (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which was augmented by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There were no correlations between plaque load and bradykinin-mediated vasodilation or tissue plasminogen activator release. Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykinin had no effect on blood flow or tissue plasminogen activator release. The vasomotor and fibrinolytic actions of bradykinin in the femoral circulation are mediated solely by the B(2) kinin receptor, irrespective of the presence of atheroma. In keeping with previous data, bradykinin-mediated tissue plasminogen activator release was augmented in the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition consistent with its putative vascular protective effect.", 
    "90": "We investigated whether acute and chronic administration of zofenopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, may modulate the expression of genes which are involved in the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia and heart failure. We used an acute and a chronic model. In the former isolated rat hearts were perfused for 120 min in the presence or in the absence of 10 \u03bcM zofenoprilat, the active metabolite of zofenopril. In the chronic model one group of rats was treated with zofenopril (15.2 mg/Kg die per os) for 15 days, while control rats were treated with the same diet, except that zofenopril was omitted. Total RNA was extracted from hearts, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate the expression of \u03b1 myosin heavy chain, superoxide dismutase, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), nitric oxide synthase 2 and 3 (NOS2, NOS3), heme oxygenase 1, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), muscle phosphofructokinase. Acute or chronic zofenopril administration did not produce any change in hemodynamic variables. qRT-PCR experiments showed that in the acute model ANP expression was slightly although not significantly increased. In the chronic model, significant changes in gene expression were detected: in particular, HSP70 was upregulated (1.06 \u00b1 0.38 vs. 0.72 \u00b1 0.20 arbitrary units, P = 0.025), while NOS3 was downregulated (0.66 \u00b1 0.06 vs. 0.83 \u00b1 0.18 arbitrary units, P = 0.007). In the chronic model, liver samples were also assayed, but no significant change in the expression of any gene was detected. We conclude that zofenopril can produce heart-specific effects on gene expression. Persistent changes were detected with regard to specific heat shock protein and nitric oxide synthase subtypes.

While the explanations for these worldwide epidemics remain speculative, it must be acknowledged that these increases in AKI, CKD and ESRD, happening worldwide, have occurred despite the universal application of strategies of renoprotection over the last 2 decades, more especially the widespread use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). We note that many of the published large renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade randomized controlled trials, upon which current evidence-based practice for the increasing use of ACEIs and ARBs for renoprotection derived from, have strong deficiencies that have been highlighted over the years. From reports in the literature, there is an increasing association of exacerbations of renal failure with ACEIs and ARBs, more so in the older hypertensive patient, >65 years old. The biological plausibility for ACEI and ARB to protect the kidneys against a background of potential multiple pathogenetic pathways to account for CKD progression appears to be not very defensible. We reviewed the literature along these lines and submit that ACEIs and ARBs often cause unrecognized significant worsening renal failure in CKD patients, sometimes irreversible, and that more caution is required regarding their use, especially in the older hypertensive patients, with likely ischemic hypertensive nephropathy. Given the increasing association of concomitant RAAS blockade with worsening renal failure following exposure to iodinated contrast, during acute illness, in the perioperative period and following lower bowel preparations prior to colonoscopy, we submit that, preferably, ACEIs and ARBs be withheld for 2-4 days prior to or during these clinical scenarios. This represents the concept of renoprevention.",

A total of 48 subjects were given either 5 times more than the effective amount of casein hydrolysate or a placebo in tablet form for 4 weeks. In the active group, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased significantly as compared with the placebo group. In stratified analysis, however, this antihypertensive effect was not found in normotensive subjects. In addition, neither an acute or nor an excessive reduction in blood pressure nor clinically important adverse events were observed in this study.

We analysed which clinical factors are associated with underutilization of evidence-based therapies in women. Methods and results From the Canadian Registry of ACS I and II, 6558 patients (4471 men and 2087 women) with a final diagnosis of ACS were selected for the current analysis. Covariates were chosen using the approach described by Blackstone. The final selected model included 23 patient clinical variables. Women were less likely than men to receive beta-blockers (75.76 vs. 79.24%; P < 0.01), lipid-modifying agents (56.37 vs. 65.44%; P < 0.0001), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors (55.52 vs. 59.99%; P < 0.01). Female sex and clinical decision not to investigate with cardiac catheterization were the strongest independent predictors for not receiving lipid-modifying agents and ACE-inhibitors. Age, Killip class 2, and Killip class 3/4 were significant independent predictors of underutilization of beta-blocker use. Women were older (69 \u00b1 12 vs. 64 \u00b1 12; P < 0.01) with a higher prevalence of Killip class \u2265 2 (19.95 vs. 15.54%; P < 0.068), and they were less likely to be referred for cardiac catheterization (41.9 vs. 49.6 %; P < 0.001). Conclusions The current findings demonstrate that underutilization of evidence-based therapies in women with ACS compared with men is associated with multiple factors related to the patient (age), the consequences of the disease (congestive heart failure), and the physician's assessment of patient risk (decision to catheterize). Female gender remains associated with underutilization of lipid-modifying agents and ACE-inhibitors despite adjustment for these confounders.", 
    "132": "Together with an expert committee a structured approach to determining quality indicators for National Disease Management Guidelines has been developed. The key steps of this approach include: introducing guideline authors to the methodology at an early stage of the process of guideline development, pre-selecting recommendations of the guideline which are potentially measurable by means of quality indicators, assessing the potentially measurable quality indicators in written form using five criteria (including their importance for the health care system and clarity of definitions) and approving them in a formal consensus process. For lack of a database these quality indicators must be regarded as preliminary. For the National Disease Management Guideline \"Chronic Heart Failure\" nine rate-based indicators have been chosen. The indicators correspond to important strong recommendations (grade of recommendation: A) from the fields of diagnosis (two), general therapeutic strategy (two), specific treatment (three), clinical monitoring (one) and co-ordination of care (one). In a second step, the quality indicators have to be validated within a pilot project. The determination and assessment of the potential quality indicators have revealed room for improvement of guideline development. In particular, there is a need for more health care data and for specification of recommendations.",

This article explores whether proposed indicators can be derived from data collected routinely in general practices. For this purpose, previous experiences and data from the research project CONTENT (CONTinuous morbidity registration Epidemiologic NeTwork) conducted under guidance of the Department of General Medicine and Health Services Research at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, were applied. The availability of numerators and denominators needed for calculating the four quality indicators for diagnosis and pharmacotherapy proposed in the DM-CPG was checked within so-called \"routine data\" from the existing dataset of the CONTENT project. Within the given context, routine data are defined as data that are periodically transmitted from health care providers to cost units within the health care system. A thorough assessment has revealed that within the given context only one indicator could be deduced from routine data collection. This was the indicator measuring the proportion of patients receiving beta receptor antagonists, compared to all patients with heart failure NYHA class II to IV. Indeed, this single indicator will only be computable if the NYHA grade of heart failure severity and the presence or absence of contraindications to beta receptor antagonist therapy are routinely collected and the data merged into a central database. Against the background of these results it is obvious that a fully developed, transsectoral concept for data collection and data transfer needs to be implemented.", 
    "134": "Arterial hypertension is frequently observed in renal transplant recipients. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial in most cases. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) can increase peripheral vascular resistance by inducing arteriolar vasoconstriction and can cause extracellular fluid expansion by reducing the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), activating the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and by inactivating the atrial natriuretic peptide. Glucocorticoids can impair urinary water and salt excretion. Poor graft function can lead to increased extracellular volume and inappropriate production of renin. Native kidneys, older age of the donor and transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) may also contribute to the development of hypertension. Arterial hypertension not only can increases the risk for cardiovascular events but can also deteriorate renal allograft function. A number of studies have shown that the higher the levels of blood pressure are, the higher is the risk of graft failure. On the other hand, a good control of blood pressure may prevent many cardiovascular and renal complications. Appropriate lifestyle modification is the first step for treating hypertension. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors are the most frequently used antihypertensive agents, but in many cases, a combination of these and other drugs is required to obtain good control of hypertension.",

Patient outcomes (death, death due to CDAD and relapse rates) were compared based on the use of ACEI or ARB during an episode of CDI. A total of 116 (37.9%) patients received an ACEI/ARB and 190 (62.1%) did not. The groups were similar except ACEI/ARB patients were older (71.9 vs. 64.3, P<0.0005) and had a higher frequency of congestive heart failure (50.9% vs. 30.2%, P<0.0005) and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (44.8% vs. 30.2%, P<0.010). ACEI/ARB patients had lower overall mortality rates (9.5% vs. 23.3%, P<0.002) as well as mortality due to CDI (2.6% vs. 8.6%, P<0.036). The rate of CDI relapse was not significantly different between the groups (5.2% in ACEI/ARB vs. 10.0%, P=0.135). Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ACEI/ARB use was associated with lower overall mortality rate (OR 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.55) and mortality due to CDI (OR 0.29; 95% CI, 0.08-1.02). Our findings suggest that ACEI/ARBs may have a role as an adjuvant therapy to antibiotics in patients with CDI. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.", 
    "138": "In adults with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), mitral regurgitation (MR) is associated with adverse prognosis and is often addressed by surgery or intervention. MR is commonly found in children with IDC, but its prognostic relevance has not been defined, and interventions to reduce MR are not routinely performed in this population. In this study, it was hypothesized that MR is an independent risk factor for death or transplantation. This was a single-center, retrospective study of sequential patients with IDC or familial IDC (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension z score >2 and ejection fraction <50%). Patients with acute myocarditis or previous mitral surgery were excluded. MR severity was graded according to American Society of Echocardiography guidelines as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of MR jet vena contracta width. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and ejection fraction were measured by biplane Simpson's method. Forty-two children with IDC were studied. The mean follow-up period was 25 months. At initial assessment, 34 children (82%) were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 25 (60%) furosemide, 27 (65%) \u03b2 blockers, and 7 (17%) intravenous inotropes. The mean indexed end-systolic volume was 91 \u00b1 51 ml/m(2). The mean ejection fraction was 27 \u00b1 16%. MR was mild in 42%, moderate in 19%, severe in 2%, and absent in 35% of patients. MR severity progressed from initial to last evaluation. MR severity was an independent risk factor for lower freedom from death or transplantation. Progression in MR severity increased the annual hazard of death or transplantation by a factor of 2.4 (p = 0.003). In conclusion, MR severity is independently associated with worse clinical status and decreased freedom from death or transplantation in children with IDC.", 
    "139": "In this study, we explored the mechanisms by which the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), enalapril, and the Ang II receptor blocker (ARB), losartan suppress oxidative stress and NF-\u03baB activation-induced inflammatory responses in aged rat kidney. The experimentations were carried out utilizing aged (24-month-old) Brown Norway\u00d7Fischer 344 (F1) male rats which were randomized into 3 groups and administered enalapril (40 mg/kg), losartan (30 mg/kg) or placebo for 6 months (daily p.o.). The level of reactive species (RS), peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), GSH/GSSG and lipid peroxidation were measured. The activity of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB, and gene expression of proteins in upstream signaling cascades were measured by electro-mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Western blotting. Enalapril and losartan differentially attenuated redox imbalance and the redox-sensitive transcription factor, the NF-\u03baB pathway. Furthermore, stimulation of the NF-\u03baB activation pathway by phosphorylation of p65 was attenuated by both compounds. Moreover, mediation of phosphorylation of p65 by phosphorylation of I\u03baB kinase \u03b1\u03b2 (IKK\u03b1\u03b2) and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK-1), were also inhibited by enalapril and losartan. Finally, both compounds also lowered expression of NF-\u03baB-dependent inflammatory genes, such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Only losartan lowered levels of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). These findings indicate that enalapril and losartan differentially suppress inflammatory responses via inhibition of oxidative stress-induced NF-\u03baB activation in aged rat kidney.",

Therefore, it is likely that genetic factors outside the SERPING1 gene have an influence on disease manifestation. In this study, functional polymorphisms in genes with a possible disease-modifying effect, B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors (BDKR1, BDKR2), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and mannose-binding lectin (MBL2), were analysed in 36 unrelated HAE patients. The same analysis was carried out in 69 HAE patients regardless of their familial relationship. No significant influence of the studied polymorphisms in the BDKR1, BDKR2, ACE and MBL2 genes on overall disease severity, localization and severity of particular attacks, frequency of oedema episodes or age of disease onset was detected in either group of patients.

Due to the important role of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of diabetic renal disease, agents that inhibit this system are recognized as first-line therapy, offering both effective blood pressure lowering and direct actions on the kidney.

Effectiveness of telmisartan is comparable to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, but with greater tolerability. The effect of telmisartan on protein excretion in diabetic nephropathy appears to be better than that of losartan and equivalent to that of valsartan.

Here, we examined the effect of atrasentan, a selective endothelin A receptor (ET(A)R) antagonist, on albuminuria in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of subjects with diabetic nephropathy already receiving stable doses of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors. We randomly assigned 89 subjects with eGFR >20 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) of 100 to 3000 mg/g to placebo or atrasentan (0.25, 0.75, or 1.75 mg daily) for 8 weeks.

Hypertension increases both macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes such as neuropathy, nephropathy, coronary artery disease, stroke, and retinopathy. Hence there is a pressing need to achieve good control of hypertension to reduce such complications. Studies have been conducted to define target blood pressure in order to minimize such complications and also to decide on the type of drugs most likely to reduce complications/adverse events among diabetics. Along with the trusted and proven therapies to control blood pressure in diabetes, efforts should also be underway to define the hitherto unknown factors contributing to this problem and the ways to control them.

The profiles of potential biological activity of protein fragments were determined and the following parameters were calculated: the frequency of occurrence of fragments with given activity (A), the frequency of release of fragments with given activity by selected enzymes (A(E)), and the relative frequency of release of fragments with given activity by selected enzymes (W). Among the examined proteins, collagen and elastin appear to be the richest potential source of bioactive peptides, in particular of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antithrombotic fragments, inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and peptides regulating gastric mucosal activity. The high number of bioactive fragments in collagen and elastin is associated with a high content of glycine and proline, amino acids that are most abundant in biologically active fragments.

Fifty-six Wistar albino rats were divided into eight experimental groups of seven rats/group. Groups 1-4 received normal saline (10 ml/kg), enalapril (0.6 mg/kg), losartan (1.4 mg/kg) and CCl(4) (80 mg/kg), respectively.

Serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin and total protein did not change significantly in these rats. Also, glutathione, malondialdehyde and uric acid levels were not significantly altered. Enalapril and losartan failed to attenuate liver injury associated with CCl(4) treatment. Although both drugs did not significantly alter serum biochemistry in the CCl(4)-treated rats, they however produced slight elevations in biomarkers of liver function and appear to worsen liver histopathology.

Academically affiliated clinicians of different specialties and levels of training were recruited by e-mailed invitations sent to clinicians within each target group. To be included, candidates needed to be currently practicing in an ambulatory care setting in which they encountered patients with heart failure. In the first part of each group, participants were asked to describe reasons for not prescribing ACE inhibitors or \u00e2-blockers for patients with heart failure. Next, participants were asked to develop concept maps that organized these reasons into categories and described the relationships between these categories. The concept maps from each group were synthesized to develop a consensus scheme for categorizing reasons for nonprescribing.",

First, clinicians hinted at their own attitude-related barriers to prescribing. However, they framed their comments largely in terms of patient-centered reasons for nonprescribing that arose in individual patient encounters. Second, decision making about heart failure drug therapy often involved a complex and overlapping series of considerations. Five categories of reasons for not prescribing ACE inhibitors or \u00e2-blockers emerged: (1) adverse effects of drug therapy; (2) nonadherence to therapeutic and monitoring plan; (3) patients' preferences and beliefs; (4) comanagement and transitions of care; and (5) prioritization and patient benefit.",

Cough is a recognised side effect of ACEI treatment, and because of this, patients often have their medication changed to an angiotensin II receptor blocker (AIIRB). Both ACEIs and AIIRBs are associated with angioedema. We present a case of a late-onset angioedema associated with pyrexia and raised levels of inflammatory markers.

Clipping of the renal artery resulted in gradual elevation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) reaching a plateau after 4 weeks of surgery. Treatment of hypertensive rats with EGb 761 (60, 90, 180 mg/kg/day orally) was therefore started 4 weeks after surgery and continued for 3 weeks. This led to a dose-dependent reduction in SBP with no significant change in heart rate. Control hypertensive rats showed a significant elevation of total protein thiols (Pr-SHs level) in both clipped and non-clipped kidneys as well as in the serum. However, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity was decreased in the clipped kidneys but elevated in the non-clipped ones and in the blood. The malondialdehyde (MDA) level was raised in clipped kidneys but not in non-clipped ones nor in the serum. Nitric oxide (NO level) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity were increased in both clipped and non-clipped kidneys but not in the serum. Endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation of aortic rings towards acetylcholine (Ach) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were impaired. Treatment with EGb 761 (180 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks) was associated with recovery of GSH-Px activity in clipped kidneys, inhibition of ACE activity in both kidneys and a reduction in the elevated NO level of the non-clipped kidneys, decreased responsiveness to the vasoconstrictor NE and improvement of endothelial function as evidenced by restoration of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by Ach. The observed beneficial effects of the EGb 761 may be attributed to different factors, including ACE inhibition and maintenance of cellular antioxidant capacity as well as preserving vascular reactivity towards endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilators while inhibiting responses to vasoconstrictors.",

Highly potent inhibitors have been developed and are extensively used in the clinic. To develop inhibitors with higher therapeutic efficacy and reduced side effects, recent efforts have been directed towards the discovery of compounds able to simultaneously block more than one zinc metallopeptidase (apart from ACE) involved in blood pressure regulation in humans, such as neprilysin and ECE-1 (endothelin-converting enzyme-1). In the present paper, we show the first structures of testis ACE [C-ACE, which is identical with the C-domain of somatic ACE and the dominant domain responsible for blood pressure regulation, at 1.97\u00c5 (1 \u00c5=0.1 nm)] and the N-domain of somatic ACE (N-ACE, at 2.15\u00c5) in complex with a highly potent and selective dual ACE/ECE-1 inhibitor. The structural determinants revealed unique features of the binding of two molecules of the dual inhibitor in the active site of C-ACE. In both structures, the first molecule is positioned in the obligatory binding site and has a bulky bicyclic P(1)' residue with the unusual R configuration which, surprisingly, is accommodated by the large S(2)' pocket. In the C-ACE complex, the isoxazole phenyl group of the second molecule makes strong pi-pi stacking interactions with the amino benzoyl group of the first molecule locking them in a 'hand-shake' conformation. These features, for the first time, highlight the unusual architecture and flexibility of the active site of C-ACE, which could be further utilized for structure-based design of new C-ACE or vasopeptidase inhibitors.",

To explore the effect of acute caffeine ingestion on brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in subjects without coronary artery disease (CAD; controls) and patients with CAD, we prospectively assessed brachial artery FMD in 40 controls and 40 age- and gender-matched patients with documented stable CAD on 2 separate mornings 1 week to 2 weeks apart. After overnight fasting, discontinuation of all medications for \u226512 hours, and absence of caffeine for >48 hours, participants received capsules with caffeine 200 mg or placebo. One hour after drug ingestion, participants underwent brachial artery FMD and nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NTG) using high-resolution ultrasound. As expected, patients with CAD were more often diabetic, hypertensive, obese, dyslipidemic, and smoked more than controls (p <0.01 for all comparisons). Aspirin, Clopidogrel, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2 blockers, and statins were significantly more common in patients with CAD than in controls (p <0.01 for all comparisons). At baseline, FMD, but not NTG, was significantly lower in patients with CAD compared to controls. Acute caffeine ingestion significantly increased FMD (patients with CAD 5.6 \u00b1 5.0% vs 14.6 \u00b1 5.0%, controls 8.4 \u00b1 2.9% vs 18.6 \u00b1 6.8%, p <0.001 for all comparisons) but not NTG (patients with CAD 13.0 \u00b1 5.2% vs 13.8 \u00b1 6.1%, controls 12.9 \u00b1 3.9% vs 13.9 \u00b1 5.8%, p = NS for all comparisons) and significantly decreased high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (patients with CAD 2.6 \u00b1 1.4 vs 1.4 \u00b1 1.2 mg/L, controls 3.4 \u00b1 3.0 vs 1.2 \u00b1 1.0 mg/L, p <0.001 for all comparisons) in the 2 groups compared to placebo.

The purpose of this review is to analyze the reasons behind the failure of the most recent trials of ACE inhibitors in vascular patients without overt LV dysfunction.

Several post-hoc analyses from large trials, in different clinical situations, confirmed the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers in primary prevention of AF. On the contrary prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind studies showed negative results as for secondary prevention of AF. The GISSI-AF trial, the largest study (1442 patients) dealing with the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers in prevention of AF recurrences, has not demonstrated any difference between patients treated with valsartan (51.4% AF recurrences in a 12-month follow-up) vs. the placebo group (52.1%, p = NS).

The ACE inhibitory, alpha-glucosidase inhibitory, antibacterial and antitumor activities of the synthesized fragments were assayed. In vitro, Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr showed high ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 = 7.42 micromol x L(-1)). The results indicate that there are two active sites in Val-Val-Tyr-Pro-Trp-Thr-Gln-Arg-Phe, one consists of Val-Val-, and the other -Gln-Arg-Phe. Peptides showed high ACE inhibitory activity when the N-terminal was hydrophobic amino acid such as Val and C-terminal tripeptide contained Phe, Trp or Arg.

    "221": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is also a progressive disease secondary to continuous structural remodelling of the atria due to AF itself, to changes associated with ageing, and to deterioration of underlying heart disease. Current management aims at preventing the recurrence of AF and its consequences (secondary prevention) and includes risk assessment and prevention of stroke, ventricular rate control, and rhythm control therapies including antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter or surgical ablation. The concept of primary prevention of AF with interventions targeting the development of substrate and modifying risk factors for AF has emerged as a result of recent experiments that suggested novel targets for mechanism-based therapies. Upstream therapy refers to the use of non-antiarrhythmic drugs that modify the atrial substrate- or target-specific mechanisms of AF to prevent the occurrence or recurrence of the arrhythmia. Such agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), statins, n-3 (\u03c9-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids, and possibly corticosteroids. Animal experiments have compellingly demonstrated the protective effect of these agents against electrical and structural atrial remodelling in association with AF. The key targets of upstream therapy are structural changes in the atria, such as fibrosis, hypertrophy, inflammation, and oxidative stress, but direct and indirect effects on atrial ion channels, gap junctions, and calcium handling are also applied. Although there have been no formal randomized controlled studies (RCTs) in the primary prevention setting, retrospective analyses and reports from the studies in which AF was a pre-specified secondary endpoint have shown a sustained reduction in new-onset AF with ACEIs and ARBs in patients with significant underlying heart disease (e.g. left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy), and in the incidence of AF after cardiac surgery in patients treated with statins. In the secondary prevention setting, the results with upstream therapies are significantly less encouraging. Although the results of hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses in selected patient categories have been positive, larger prospective RCTs have yielded controversial, mostly negative, results. Notably, the controversy exists on whether upstream therapy may impact mortality and major non-fatal cardiovascular events in patients with AF. This has been addressed in retrospective analyses and large prospective RCTs, but the results remain inconclusive pending further reports. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the role of upstream therapies in primary (Part I) and secondary (Part II) prevention of AF.",

By modeling the observed relationship seen between molecular descriptors and their corresponding biological activities, we may predict the behavior of other molecules with similar descriptors. In QSAR studies, it has been shown that the quality of the prediction model strongly depends on the selected features within molecular descriptors. Thus, methods capable of automatic selection of relevant features are very desirable. In this paper, we present a new feature selection algorithm for a QSAR study based on kernel alignment which has been used as a measure of similarity between two kernel functions. In our algorithm, we deploy kernel alignment as an evaluation tool, using recursive feature elimination to compute a molecular descriptor containing the most important features needed for a classification application. Empirical results show that the algorithm works well for the computation of descriptors for various applications involving different QSAR data sets. The prediction accuracies are substantially increased and are comparable to those from earlier studies.",

A total of 391 hypertensive outpatients with metabolic syndrome, in sinus rhythm but with at least 2 episodes of AF in the previous 6 months were randomized to telmisartan, ramipril, or amlodipine for 1 year. At the first AF, ventricular rate (VR) and plasma cardiac troponin I (TnI) were evaluated. P-wave dispersion (PWD) and procollagen type I carboxy-terminal peptide (PIP) were evaluated before and after 12 months of treatment. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were similarly and significantly reduced by all treatments (P < .001). In all, 49% of patients treated with amlodipine had a recurrence of AF as did 25.5% of patients with ramipril and 12.9% of patients with telmisartan (P < .01 vs amlodipine and P < .05 vs ramipril). Ventricular rate and TnI at the first AF recurrence were significantly lower with telmisartan and ramipril than with amlodipine. P-wave dispersion was reduced by ramipril (-5.1 ms, P < .05) and even more by telmisartan (-11 ms, P < .01). Telmisartan and ramipril induced a similar PIP reduction (-52.8 and -49.8 \u00b5g/L, respectively, P < .01). These findings suggested that in these patients telmisartan was more effective than ramipril in reducing AF recurrence and severity as well as in improving PWD, despite a similar BP reduction and a similar improvement in cardiac fibrosis. This could be related to a specific effect of telmisartan on atrial electric remodeling.", 
    "239": "Whey protein concentrate (WPC) was subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis by proteases from the flowers of Cynara cardunculus, and the resulting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect was monitored. The whole WPC hydrolysate exhibited an IC(50) value of 52.9 \u00b1 2.9 \u03bcg/mL, whereas the associated peptide fraction with molecular weight below 3 kDa scored 23.6 \u00b1 1.1 \u03bcg/mL. The latter fraction was submitted to RP-HPLC, and 6 fractions were resolved that exhibited ACE-inhibitory effects. Among the various peptides found, a total of 14 were identified via sequencing with an ion-trap mass spectrometer. Eleven of these peptides were synthesized de novo--to validate their ACE-inhibitory effect, and also to ascertain their stability when exposed to simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Among them, three novel, highly potent peptides were found, corresponding to \u03b1-lactalbumin f(16-26)--with the sequence KGYGGVSLPEW, \u03b1-lactalbumin f(97-104) with DKVGINYW, and \u03b2-lactoglobulin f(33-42) with DAQSAPLRVY; their IC(50) values were as low as 0.80 \u00b1 0.1, 25.2 \u00b1 1.0 and 13.0 \u00b1 1.0 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. None of them remained stable in the presence of gastrointestinal enzymes: they were partially, or even totally hydrolyzed to smaller peptides--yet the observed ACE-inhibitory effects were not severely affected for two of those peptides.", 
    "240": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a disorder of the rhythm of electrical activation of the cardiac atria. It is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, has multiple aetiologies, and increases the risk of death from stroke. Pharmacological therapy is the mainstay of treatment for AF, but currently available anti-arrhythmic drugs have limited efficacy and safety. An improved understanding of how anti-arrhythmic drugs affect the electrophysiological mechanisms of AF initiation and maintenance, in the setting of the different cardiac diseases that predispose to AF, is therefore required. A variety of animal models of AF has been developed, to represent and control the pathophysiological causes and risk factors of AF, and to permit the measurement of detailed and invasive parameters relating to the associated electrophysiological mechanisms of AF. The purpose of this review is to examine, consolidate and compare available relevant data on in-vivo electrophysiological mechanisms of AF suppression by currently approved and investigational anti-arrhythmic drugs in such models. These include the Vaughan Williams class I-IV drugs, namely Na(+) channel blockers, \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, action potential prolonging drugs, and Ca(2+) channel blockers; the \"upstream therapies\", e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and fish oils; and a variety of investigational drugs such as \"atrial-selective\" multiple ion channel blockers, gap junction-enhancers, and intracellular Ca(2+)-handling modulators. It is hoped that this will help to clarify the main electrophysiological mechanisms of action of different and related drug types in different disease settings, and the likely clinical significance and potential future exploitation of such mechanisms.",

We retrospectively investigated the impact of such strategy on clinical outcome. 25 patients with PA and 25 with essential hypertension (EH) were studied. Initially all subjects were evaluated biochemically and received if possible an adjustment of their medication following the guidlines. Mineralocorticoid antagonists were discontinued in all subjects. Only 26 of 50 patients could be studied under optimal conditions (drug free or on medication with minimal influence on ARR) whereas the remaining 24 subjects had to receive additional drugs (such as ACE inhibitor, angiotensin-2 receptor blocker, or betablockers) because of initial blood pressure or comorbidities. Every fifth patient with a switch of the medication experienced a significant increase in blood pressure. 13 of 25 of PA patients needed potassium supplementation (105+/-25 mEq per day; range 8-320 mEq). Nine of these patients remained hypokalemic despite substitution (serum K 2.82+/-0.07 mmol/l), with 7 classified severely hypokalemic (<.3.0). We observed 6 serious adverse events requiring hospitalization including hypertensive crisis (n\u2009=\u20093), atrial fibrillation (n\u2009=\u20091), heart failure (n\u2009=\u20091) and ICD triggered electric shock (n\u2009=\u20091). In conclusion, in our experience the adjustment of the antihypertensive treatment during screening for PA is only possible in approximately half of patients and can cause severe side effect. Such recommendation, therefore, must include a note of caution because of possibly deleterious side effects.",

To date, however, SSc with advanced renal failure has only rarely been reported in the absence of SRC. We report here an atypical case of diffuse cutaneous SSc where renal insufficiency progressed slowly to end-stage renal failure over a 14-year follow-up period after the diagnosis of SSc. In the renal biopsy, which was obtained at a relatively early stage of renal impairment, we found histological findings consistent with those of scleroderma kidneys. Unlike typical SRC, however, the larger renal arteries seemed to be unaffected. These histological findings were probably responsible for the \"slowly progressive\" renal impairment over the years without causing typical SRC.",

Usually renal disease progresses during the third decade of life to renal failure; however the pathogenesis of renal disease is not well understood. In this study we describe treatment of renal disease in two siblings with FLD. The proband WX at the age of 31\u00a0years presented proteinuria and ankle oedema during her third pregnancy. Diagnosis of FLD was based on a renal biopsy with characteristic serpiginous fibrillar deposits under electron microscopy, markedly decreased HDL cholesterol, esterified cholesterol levels and LCAT activity, confirmed by molecular analysis. After 3\u00a0years her proteinuria increased and she received an ACE inhibitor to which she responded well. During further increases of proteinuria she additionally received methylprednisolone and her proteinuria decreased. This long-term observation indicates the efficacy of corticosteroids and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers in the treatment of proteinuria in patients with FLD. The results suggest the role of inflammatory processes as well as dyslipidemia in the pathogenesis of glomerular disorders in LCAT-deficient patients.", 
    "261": "We assessed the contribution of angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] to captopril-induced cardiovascular protection in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) chronically treated with the nitric oxide synthesis inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (SHR-l). NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (80 mg/L) administration for 3 weeks increased mean arterial pressure (MAP) from 196 \u00b1 6 to 229 \u00b1 3 mm Hg (P < 0.05). Treatment of SHR-l with Ang-(1-7) antagonist [d-Ala7]-Ang-(1-7) (A779; 744 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1) ip) further elevated MAP to 253 \u00b1 6 mm Hg (P < 0.05 vs SHR-l or SHR). Moreover, A779 treatment attenuated the reduction in MAP and proteinuria by either captopril (300 mg/L in drinking water) or hydralazine (1.5 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7d(-1) ip). In isolated perfused hearts, the recovery of left ventricular function from global ischemia was enhanced by captopril or hydralazine treatment and was exacerbated with A779. The Ang-(1-7) antagonist attenuated the beneficial effects of captopril and hydralazine on cardiac function. Recovery from global ischemia was also improved in isolated SHR-l hearts acutely perfused with captopril during both the perfusion and reperfusion periods. The acute administration of A779 reduced the beneficial actions of captopril to improve recovery after ischemia. We conclude that during periods of reduced nitric oxide availability, endogenous Ang-(1-7) plays a protective role in effectively buffering the increase in blood pressure and renal injury and the recovery from cardiac ischemia. Moreover, Ang-(1-7) contributes to the blood pressure lowering and tissue protective actions of captopril and hydralazine in a model of severe hypertension and end-organ damage.",

Apneas stimulate atrial natriuretic peptide release and sympathetic nerve activity, which persists throughout the daytime. The combination of increased sympathetic nerve activity and a nocturnal diuresis help explain reports that \u03b2-1 antagonists lower blood pressure more than thiazide diuretics in OSA. The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II blocking drugs have been equally effective in some studies. Patients with treatment-resistant hypertension usually have OSA and have had a good antihypertensive response to spironolactone.",

ARBs are a new class of antihypertensive agent that is developed to exclude the adverse effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. In theory, ARBs do not contribute to the occurrence of angioedema because they do not increase the serum level of bradykinin, the responsible substance for angioedema. However, some reports of ARB-induced angioedema have recently been published. In this study, we present the forth case and the first Asian case of angioedema due to valsartan, which is one of the ARBs.

Albuminuria was defined as a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio \u2265 30 \u03bcg/mg. Microalbuminuria was defined as 30 to 300 \u03bcg albumin/mg creatinine, and macroalbuminuria as a urinary albumin/creatinine ratio of \u2265 300 \u03bcg/mg. The prevalence of stenoses of \u2265 50% was significantly greater in patients with albuminuria than in those with normoalbuminuria (66% vs 51%; p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive protein, body mass index, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II antagonists, aspirin, and statins, confirmed that albuminuria was significantly associated with stenoses \u2265 50% (standardized adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15 to 2.44; p = 0.007). The adjusted OR was 1.54 (95% CI 1.03 to 2.30; p = 0.034) for microalbuminuria and 2.55 (95% CI 1.14 to 5.72; p = 0.023) for macroalbuminuria.

The hospital lengths of stay of patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated acute kidney injury (median 12 days, range 4-298 days) were greater compared to those of patients without angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated acute kidney injury (median 10 days, range 3-199 days, p < .05).",

    "285": "Treatment strategies to improve blood pressure control, reduce end-organ damage, and improve cardiovascular outcomes are more important today than ever before. Most patients will require combination therapy to achieve target blood pressure; early initiation of combination therapy may help patients achieve blood pressure control more rapidly. Low-dose combinations may be more effective with fewer adverse effects than higher doses of single agents. Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is an important contributor in the pathogenesis of hypertension and its sequelae. Treatment with a direct renin inhibitor blocks the rate-limiting step in the RAAS, resulting in decreased angiotensin I and II production and decreased urinary aldosterone excretion. Like the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, treatment with a direct renin inhibitor increases plasma renin concentration, but unlike the other RAAS inhibitors, treatment with a direct renin inhibitor decreases plasma renin activity. This unique combination of effects on the RAAS make a direct renin inhibitor an attractive option to combine with other antihypertensive agents for the management of hypertension and its comorbidities. Clinical studies have shown that combining the direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, with drugs representing each of the major classes of antihypertensive agents (thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and calcium-channel blockers) reduces blood pressure, improves markers for cardiovascular outcomes, or does both. Results of several ongoing randomized clinical trials should provide additional insights into the potential of therapeutic combinations that include aliskiren to improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with hypertension and related comorbidities.",

All patients were required to be on a stable dose of an ACE-inhibitor or ARB, and beta-blocker unless contraindicated or not tolerated. Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline, and following 26-36 weeks of treatment. The primary endpoint was change in left ventricular end-systolic volume from baseline to 36 weeks, and was evaluable in 329 patients in the placebo group and 343 patients in the aliskiren group. We observed no difference in the primary endpoint of end-systolic volume change between patients randomized to aliskiren (-4.4 \u00b1 16.8 mL) or placebo (-3.5 \u00b1 16.3 mL), or in secondary measures of end-diastolic volume, or LVEF.

We assembled a large cohort of Medicare beneficiaries with a diagnosis of hypertension who had not filled a prescription for an antihypertensive medication in the prior 365 days. All subsequently began treatment with a single antihypertensive drug. These subjects were followed forward using health care utilization data to determine the risk of a typical osteoporotic fracture. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression models were constructed to assess the relative risk of fracture across types of antihypertensive medications. We identified 376,061 eligible subjects. Fracture rate in the total cohort was 35.2 per 1000 person-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 34.4-36.1]. Rates varied significantly across type of antihypertensive, with thiazide diuretics having the lowest rate (28.5, 95% CI 25.4-31.9) and loop diuretics the highest rate (49.0, 95% CI 46.1-52.1). In models adjusting for relevant comorbidities and comedications accessible in health care utilization data, the risk of fracture was reduced in users of angiotensin receptor blockers [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.86) and thiazide diuretics (HR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.76-0.97) compared with calcium channel blockers.

The aim of this article is to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of PGE(1), both in pain control and in the healing times of Martorell's ulcers for patients already undergoing antihypertensive treatment. Between January 2004 and December 2008, we recruited 10 patients with Martorell's ulcers. These patients were organized into two groups (A and B). Group A included six patients who underwent only antihypertensive treatment with calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Group B consisted of four patients who underwent continuous administration of PGE(1) through a single-day elastomer (120 \u00b5g/24 hours) for 7 days. In both groups, we observed a progressive reduction in the surface area of Martorell's ulcers until complete recovery, but there was a significant difference with regards to healing time. We also observed a significant improvement in symptomatic pain after only 2 days of PGE(1) therapy. It has now been proved that antihypertensive treatment leads to ulcers healing but, according to our experience, intravenous infusion of prostaglandins improves peripheral perfusion and symptomatic pain and decreases healing time.",

Lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of IL-1\u03b2 by PMNs from 15 hypertensive and 15 normotensive subjects after incubation with losartan, captopril, amlodipine, atenolol, and hydrochlorothiazide were assessed. IL-1\u03b2 secretion by PMNs markedly increased in hypertensive patients versus normotensive subjects. Losartan, captopril, and amlodipine caused a concentration-dependent attenuation of IL-1\u03b2 levels in both groups. Losartan, captopril, and amlodipine demonstrated marked in vitro anti-inflammatory effects at clinically relevant serum concentrations but atenolol and hydrochlorothiazide did not.", 
    "314": "Endothelial dysfunction in essential hypertension is an independent predictor for future cardiovascular events. Although inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) reportedly improves endothelial function through its effects on oxidative stress and inflammation, questions remain regarding the factors that are pivotal for improvement of endothelial function by RAS inhibition. We therefore performed a prospective, randomized crossover trial in which an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, olmesartan and calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, were compared in 31 essential hypertensive patients. Results showed that, although both treatments achieved comparable lowering of blood pressure (BP), olmesartan, but not amlodipine, significantly improved endothelial function as evaluated by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) in the brachial artery. Although no significant changes in diabetic and lipid parameters were observed with either drug, olmesartan slightly decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate, which, surprisingly, translated into decreased microalbuminuria. In a similar vein, olmesartan reduced serum C-reactive protein and increased urine antioxidant levels compared with baseline, and reduced urine 8-epi-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 levels compared with both baseline and amlodipine. Finally, although overall changes in plasma extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) levels were not modulated by either treatment, for olmesartan there was a positive correlation between changes in FMD and those in EC-SOD levels. In conclusion, olmesartan improved endothelial function in hypertensive patients independent of its BP-lowering effect, which was due, at least in part, to its antioxidative property. Therefore, olmesartan might provide a greater long-term benefit for hypertensive patients with impaired endothelial function than amlodipine.",

Eighteen normotensive healthy controls were followed for the same period. Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and after 30/60 days of treatment with enalapril. Plasma NOx (nitrites + nitrates) concentrations were determined by using the Griess reaction. Plasma nitrite and whole blood nitrite concentrations were determined by using an ozone-based chemiluminescence assay. Plasma thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) and 8-isoprostane concentrations were determined by a fluorimetric method and by ELISA, respectively.",

    "319": "The proteins, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), act in concert to balance thrombus formation and degradation, thereby modulating the development of arterial thrombosis and excessive bleeding. PAI-1 is upregulated by the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), specifically by angiotensin II, the product of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) cleavage of angiotensin I, which is produced by the cleavage of angiotensinogen (AGT) by renin (REN). ACE indirectly stimulates the release of t-PA which, in turn, activates the corresponding fibrinolytic system. Single polymorphisms in these pathways have been shown to significantly impact plasma levels of t-PA and PAI-1 differently in Ghanaian males and females. Here we explore the involvement of epistatic interactions between the same polymorphisms in central genes of the RAS and fibrinolytic systems on plasma t-PA and PAI-1 levels within the same population (n = 992). Statistical modeling of pairwise interactions was done using two-way ANOVA between polymorphisms in the ETNK2, RENIN, ACE, PAI-1, t-PA, and AGT genes. The most significant interactions that associated with t-PA levels were between the ETNK2 A6135G and the REN T9435C polymorphisms in females (p = 0.006) and the REN T9435C and the TPA I/D polymorphisms (p = 0.005) in males. The most significant interactions for PAI-1 levels were with REN T9435C and the TPA I/D polymorphisms (p = 0.001) in females, and the association of REN G6567T with the TPA I/D polymorphisms (p = 0.032) in males. Our results provide evidence for multiple genetic effects that may not be detected using single SNP analysis. Because t-PA and PAI-1 have been implicated in cardiovascular disease these results support the idea that the genetic architecture of cardiovascular disease is complex. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the relationship between interacting polymorphisms of pathway specific genes that predict t-PA and PAI-1 levels.", 
    "320": "Albuminuria and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are common manifestations of many inflammatory diseases. Cardiovascular-based drugs, with secondary anti-inflammatory actions, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors are able to reduce both proteinuria and CRP levels, raising the question of whether CRP directly influences the processes that result in proteinuria. As proteinuria is thought to be induced as a result of podocyte dysfunction, we investigated whether there is a pathomechanistic link with CRP.",

    "322": "Our results demonstrated that inflammatory agents such as macrophage-conditioned medium and interleukin-1\u03b2 induced the expression of CRP messenger RNA in podocytes. However, they were unable to induce CRP protein. Stimulation of podocytes with exogenous CRP demonstrated that 10 \u03bcg/mL CRP induced a low but significant level of interleukin-6 secretion. Tumour necrosis factor \u03b1, however, was not detected. CRP did up-regulate the expression of the slit diaphragm proteins nephrin and CD2AP, as well as the structural proteins ezrin and podocalyxin-like protein-1, proteins known to be involved in signalling via the phosphotidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase pathway. CRP exposure reduced caspase-3 enzyme activity and up-regulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. In the presence of the PI-3 kinase inhibitor LY294002, the ability of CRP to suppress caspase-3 activity was significantly reduced.", 
    "323": "Taken together, these data suggest that rather than inducing podocyte damage, CRP may be a survival factor for podocytes by maintaining their structural integrity and initiating a survival cascade, which may facilitate podocyte recovery from injury.",

In comparison to patients without diabetes, the probability to receive these therapies was increased in diabetic HFNEF patients (p < 0.001), but not in diabetic SHF patients. Aldosterone receptor blockers were given more often to diabetic patients with reduced ejection fraction (p < 0.001), and the presence and severity of diabetes decreased the probability to receive this substance class, irrespective of renal function.",

Clinical disease can be divided into five different groups the features of which are determined by the underlying pathophysiology. One of these five clinical syndromes is the nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria > 3.5 g/day accompanied by hypalbuminemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and pronounced edema. The nephrotic syndrome may be the clinical manifestation of a row of underlying diseases. The pathophysiological basics had remained elusive for decades, yet recently significant progress which allows for establishing new therapeutic strategies has been made. A major breakthrough in understanding the function of the glomerular filter unit has been possible in the last years through both genetic and cell biological studies, which have revealed a crucial role for the visceral epithelial cells of the glomerulus - the podocytes. By now various factors have been found causing podocyte damage, such as toxines, immunological phenomena or systemic disease like diabetes mellitus.",

These observations, coupled with growing evidence that RAAS-active drugs may have anti-depressant properties prompted us to study the frequency of anti-depressant medication usage in the patients receiving RAAS-active agents. A chart review was performed on 378 patients who were seen during a 3-month period in a primary care clinic and who were diagnosed with hypertension. Demographic information and data on the rates of co-administration of antihypertensive and anti-depressant medications was collected. Overall, 23.7% of the sample was on an antidepressant. 20% of the patients taking a RAAS-modifying medication were on an antidepressant, compared to 34% of those not taking a RAAS-modifying medication (\u03a7(2) = 8.88, P = 0.003). The patients taking a beta-blocker alone had the highest rate of antidepressant usage (40%). The use of RAAS-modifying medications was associated with an even lower rate of anti-depressant usage in males compared with females. It was also observed that the patients taking an additional diuretic had a significantly lower rate of antidepressant use (17.6%, \u03a7(2) = 5.81, P = 0.016) compared with the patients not taking a diuretic. The patients being treated with an ACE inhibitor or ARB showed significantly lower rates of antidepressant usage.

Loop diuretics, nitrates, digoxin, hydralazine and amiodarone may be used when patients do not respond to initial therapy. Review by a cardiologist is often useful to exclude myocardial ischaemia and to perform echocardiography which is a key investigation in assessment of CHF patients.

Although use of several CVD medications was higher in patients with previous CVD events than in patients with no previous CVD, less than 75% of patients with previous CVD were using a statin or antiplatelet agent.",

    "338": "The incidence of chronic kidney disease leading to end-stage renal disease has significantly increased and may reach epidemic proportions over the next decade. Regardless of the initial insult, the progression of most forms of renal disease results in tubulo-interstitial fibrosis. This has been closely correlated to the future appearance of renal failure and has therefore been associated with poor long-term prognosis. New molecules and agents to limit the development of tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and slow down the progression towards end-stage renal disease are needed. In the past twenty years, many efforts have been made to understand the mechanisms of tubulo-intersititial fibrosis with the final goal to develop new therapeutic strategies. In this context, this review will focus on the mechanisms and factors involved in the development and the progression of renal fibrosis and will discuss the new promising therapeutic strategies in animal and humans.", 
    "339": "Despite the proven efficacy of current strategies for cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction, a considerable gap remains between the risk reductions achieved in clinical trials and those seen in clinical practice. A major reason for this is poor compliance to medication, which has been extensively documented for antihypertensive therapy. Low adherence results in suboptimal blood pressure control, which is associated with adverse CV outcomes and increased treatment costs. Adverse effects of medication are an important cause of diminished adherence. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) may offer better long-term tolerability than other classes of antihypertensive agent, and this is likely to be a major factor in the high levels of adherence and persistence seen with these agents. This could have implications for CV protection, as confirmed by the results of recent clinical trials. Thus, ARBs should be considered as an alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients at risk of low adherence.",

This assumption is challenged by the findings of recent studies. The patients of these studies had different types of WT1 mutations and varying clinical presentations. However, all of them were of young age and the favourable response to CsA might be the result of treatment at an early stage of the disease. The additional administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have contributed to the positive outcome. We review recent data on the role of WT1 in the development of WT1-GP and discuss putative therapeutic targets explaining the therapeutic effect of CsA.",

Treatment of SNX with enalapril from week 8-12 significantly improved myocardial fibrosis (1.63\u00b10.25%, p<0.05), but not capillary reduction (3908\u00b1486 mm/mm(3)) or increased intercapillary distance. In contrast, alternative antihypertensive treatment showed no such effect.

    "345": "Induction of tolerance against grafted organs is achieved by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine, a prominent member of the calcineurin inhibitors. Unfortunately, its lifetime use is associated with hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Several mechanism for cyclosporine induced hypertension have been proposed, i.e. activation of the sympathetic nervous system, endothelin-mediated systemic vasoconstriction, impaired vasodilatation secondary to reduction in prostaglandin and nitric oxide, altered cytosolic calcium translocation, and activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In this regard the molecular basis for undue RAS activation and an increased signaling of the vasoactive oligopeptide angiotensin II (AngII) remain elusive. Notably, angiotensinogen (AGT) is the precursor of AngII and transcriptional regulation of AGT is controlled by the hepatic nuclear factor HNF4alpha. To better understand the molecular events associated with cyclosporine induced hypertension, we investigated the effect of cyclosporine on HNF4alpha expression and activity and searched for novel HNF4alpha target genes among members of the RAS cascade. Using bioinformatic algorithm and EMSA bandshift assays we identified angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AGTR1), angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), and angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as genes targeted by HNF4alpha. Notably, cyclosporine represses HNF4alpha gene and protein expression and its DNA-binding activity at consensus sequences to AGT, AGTR1, ACE, and ACE2. Consequently, the gene expression of AGT, AGTR1, and ACE2 was significantly reduced as evidenced by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. While RAS is composed of a sophisticated interplay between multiple factors we propose a decrease of ACE2 to enforce AngII signaling via AGTR1 to ultimately result in vasoconstriction and hypertension. Taken collectively we demonstrate cyclosporine to repress HNF4alpha activity through calcineurin inhibitor mediated inhibition of nuclear factor of activation of T-cells (NFAT) which in turn represses HNF4alpha that leads to a disturbed balance of RAS.",

ADMA significantly increased horseradish peroxidase (HRP) permeability in BRCECs. Benazepril, telmisartan, DPI, and NAC downregulated cell permeability. ADMA markedly upregulated ICAM-1 expression in BRCECs, which were downregulated by telmisartan, DPI, and NAC. ADMA significantly downregulated occludin expression in BRCECs.

    "355": "Dual inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and neprilysin (NEP) by drugs such as omapatrilat produces superior antihypertensive efficacy but cause high incidence of angioedema. We examined whether dual inhibition of angiotensin AT1 receptor (ARB) and NEP (ARB-NEPI, valsartan-candoxatril) provides similar efficacy to omapatrilat without the risk of angioedema. Activity of test compounds at the targets was assayed using fluorescence-based enzyme assays (ACE, NEP, aminopeptidase P) or competition binding assays (AT1). Target engagement in vivo (ACE, AT1, and NEP) was quantified by measuring inhibition of angiotensin-pressor responses and potentiation of atrial natriuretic peptide-induced urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) output in rats. Tracheal plasma extravasation (TPE) was used as a surrogate to assess propensity of compounds to promote upper airway angioedema. Antihypertensive efficacy in renin-dependent and -independent states was measured in spontaneously hypertensive rats and deoxycorticosterone acetate salt hypertensive rats, respectively. Administration of omapatrilat and coadministration of valsartan and candoxatril blocked angiotensin induced vasopressor responses and potentiated atrial natriuretic peptide-induced increase in urinary cGMP output. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, valsartan, omapatrilat, and valsartan-candoxatril combination all produced reduction in blood pressure to a similar extent, whereas candoxatril was ineffective. In deoxycorticosterone acetate rats, omapatrilat, candoxatril, and valsartan-candoxatril combination but not valsartan produced reduction in blood pressure. Antihypertensive doses of omapatrilat produced robust increases in TPE; by contrast, valsartan, candoxatril, or their combination did not increase TPE. Pretreatment with icatibant, a bradykinin B2 antagonist, abolished omapatrilat-induced TPE but not its antihypertensive effects. On the background of NEP inhibition, suppression of the renin-angiotensin system through ARB and ACE inhibition shows a similar antihypertensive efficacy but exerts differential effects on bradykinin metabolism and TPE indicative of reduced risk of angioedema. Thus, dual AT1 receptor blockade and NEP inhibition is potentially an attractive approach to retain the excellent antihypertensive effects of omapatrilat but with a superior safety profile.",

As identification of the EPC is controversial and studies refer cells that might fall into either pools, we will use the term, vasculogenesis-related progenitor cells (VRPC), for this review. VRPC are considered to be an important target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Angiotensin II is known to be an important player in neovascularisation and the modulation of renin angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the major pharmacotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of CVD. We will review the effects of different components of the RAS on such VRPC under physiological conditions and in CVD. The reviewed research strongly supports a critical role of the RAS in vasculogenesis and vascular regeneration. Therefore, pharmacological intervention on the components of the RAS does not only target directly end-organ remodelling and blood pressure but also influence tissue healing and/or regeneration by influencing specific progenitor cells. Thus, the interrogation of RAS effects on VRPC will be important in the optimisation of RAS intervention or regenerative therapy.",

Forty-two patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy treated with the therapy were studied. Complete left ventricular reverse remodeling was defined as LV end-diastolic dimension \u2264 55 mm and fractional shortening \u2265 25% at the last echocardiographic assessment. The incidence of complete LVRR was significantly higher in patients who survived than in those who died or underwent heart transplantation. Patients were divided into 3 groups: death or transplantation, alive with complete LVRR, and alive without complete LVRR. Although patients who died or underwent transplantation did not show any LV improvements, those with complete LVRR showed significant improvements at 1 to 6 months after starting the therapy. Patients without complete LVRR also showed small but significant improvements at 1 to 6 months. The decrease in LV end-systolic dimension from the initial value to that at 1 to 6 months was an independent determinant of future cardiac death or transplantation. In conclusion, complete LVRR is related to favorable prognosis in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The extent of left ventricular reverse remodeling at 1 to 6 months after starting the therapy is predictive of long-term prognosis.",

    "376": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterized by decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. In addition, the beneficial NO turns to be deleterious when it reacts with superoxide anion, leading to peroxynitrite formation. Numerous experimental and clinical studies have reported increased production of reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical) both in animals and patients with CHF. Moreover, there are indicative data suggesting mechanisms associated with endothelial dysfunction in states of CHF, mainly attributed to decreased NO bioavailability and enhanced inactivation of the latter. Thus, such molecules appear to be potential targets in patients with CHF. These patients are strong candidates to receive a variety of therapeutic agents, some of which have known antioxidant effects. Classic treatment with statins or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been found to be beneficial in restoring NO and improving myocardial function and structure. Other agents such as sildenafil and b-blockers along with novel agents such as NO synthase transcription enhancers have been proved to be also beneficial, but their use for such a purpose is still controversial. Approaches using more-effective antioxidants or targeting myocardial oxidant-producing enzymes and oxidative or nitrosative stress might be promising strategies in the future.",

ARB as well as ACE inhibitors have a preventive effect and calcium-channel-blockers show a neutral position regarding the development of new-onset diabetes. Two publications report on economic results. The first one evaluates the cost-effectiveness of ARB alone or in combination with calcium-channel-blockers in comparison to diuretics alone or in combination with beta-blockers. The second publication compares economic outcomes of calcium-channel-blockers and beta-blockers considering the development of new-onset diabetes. Treatment with the ARB candesartan lead to savings in total costs of 549 US-Dollar per patient and in incremental costs of 30,000 US-Dollar per diabetes mellitus avoided. In the second publication, costs to the amount of 18,965 Euro in Great Britain and 13,210 Euro in Sweden are quoted for an avoided event. The treatment with calcium-channel-blockers compared to beta-blockers is proven to be more cost-effective. No publications were identified regarding ethical, social and legal aspects.",

The two economic studies do not address all the objectives sufficiently. Ethical, social and legal aspects are discussed but not analysed systematically.", 
    "387": "Based on these studies, sufficient evidence to confirm the presumption that diuretics and/or beta-blockers promote the development of new-onset diabetes compared to other antihypertensive agents, especially in patients who are predisposed, is presented with this report. Trials reflecting the clinical relevance of treatment-induced diabetes mellitus compared to existing diabetes mellitus regarding cardiovascular outcomes are required. Also health economic evaluations considering the development of new-onset diabetes should be conducted for the different classes of antihypertensive agents.", 
    "388": "Although metabolic syndrome confers an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population, little is known about the alteration of abdominal adiposity and its association with adipocytokines in hemodialysis patients. We investigated the plasma high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin level and its relationship to visceral fat area (VFA) and various markers of atherosclerosis in hemodialysis patients. In a cross-sectional study, conventional cardiovascular risk factors, plasma total and HMW adiponectin, the number of components of the metabolic syndrome and, using computed tomography, the distribution of abdominal adiposity were assessed in 144 hemodialysis patients (90 men and 54 women; mean age, 60.7 years) and 30 age- and sex-matched patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Plasma HMW adiponectin levels in hemodialysis patients were significantly higher than those in patients with CKD, negatively associated with VFA and serum triglycerides and positively associated with plasma total adiponectin, as well as the HMW-to-total adiponectin ratio in men and women (all P < 0.05) in a simple regression analysis. In a multiple regression analysis, VFA was a significant determinant of HMW adiponectin in hemodialysis patients. Furthermore, after adjustment for classical risk factors, HMW adiponectin levels were significantly higher in patients undergoing treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors or calcium channel blockers compared with patients not undergoing such treatment. This study shows that plasma HMW adiponectin levels were negatively associated with VFA and positively associated with treatment with blockade of the renin-angiotensin system and of the calcium channel. Therefore, these drugs might be effective for improving adipocytokine-related metabolic abnormalities in hemodialysis patients.",

In this study, the relationship of anxiety with BP and the effect of anxiolytic treatment on BP were investigated. METHODS. Emergency department (ED) patients with an initial systolic BP (SBP) \u2265 160 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) \u2265 100 mmHg but no end organ damage were approached for inclusion in the study. In those consenting to participate, anxiety levels were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and Visual Analog Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A). Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral alprazolam 0.5 mg or captopril 25 mg. BP and anxiety levels were measured at baseline and at 1 and 2 h after administration of the study medication. RESULTS. Of 133 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 53 patients agreed to participate. Of these, 27 patients (50.9%) received captopril and 26 patients (49.1%) received alprazolam. The majority of the patients had a high-level trait (96.2%, n = 51) and state anxiety (81.1%, n = 43). The mean SBP and VAS-A values of both patient groups dropped significantly over the 2 h, with no significant difference between the two groups.

A number of studies demonstrated that pharamacological modulation of the RAS, either with angiotensin converting (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), provides cardiovascular and renal protection. Blockade of the RAS, either with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in high risk patients. ACE inhibitors as well as ARBs are drugs of choice in congestive heart failure, as well as in diabetic nephropathy. Especially, the combined RAS blockade with ACE inhibitors and ARBs was more effective than monotherapy in diabetic or non-diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria. However, this combined RAS blockade was not equally dominant in treatment of hypertension and was not recommended for widespread antihypertensive use.",

The keratinocyte acetylcholine axis is composed of the enzymes mediating acetylcholine synthesis (acetyltransferase) and degradation (acetylcholinesterase), and two classes of acetylcholine receptors. In this study we investigated the effect of captopril, an ACE-inhibitor, on acetylcholinesterase and acetylcholine secretion in human keratinocytes. We analyzed the level of acetylcholinesterase in HaCat and NHEK cells by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. In addition, the effect of captopril on AChE activity was evaluated. We found that captopril induces a strong AChE up-regulation leading to ACh degradation and reduced secretion. Our results suggest that acantholysis induced by ACE-inhibitors might be linked to altered level of Ach.", 
    "400": "There is now clear evidence that reducing blood pressure (BP) with a broad range of agents, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, improves cardiovascular and renal outcomes. There is also evidence suggesting that these drugs have beneficial effects that are independent of BP lowering. Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor that interrupts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) at its rate-limiting step. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, aliskiren produces a sustained reduction in plasma renin activity and reduces plasma levels of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Preclinical data and clinical trials in high-risk patients using surrogate markers increasingly suggest that aliskiren can reduce the progression of end-organ damage beyond that afforded by BP control. With its unique mechanism of action, combining aliskiren with another RAAS-blocking agent that has a different mechanism of action may provide more comprehensive blockade of the RAAS, potentially conferring additional clinical benefits. Evaluation of these end-organ effects in humans is underway in clinical trials designed to assess the effects of aliskiren alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents on cardiovascular and renal outcomes.",

As increased serum angiotensin II levels may play a role in this dysfunction, we evaluated the microcirculatory effects of enalaprilat in an experimental model of septic shock. One hour after injection of 1.5 g/kg body weight of feces into the abdominal cavity, 16 adult female anesthetized, mechanically ventilated sheep were randomized to receive 2.5 mg enalaprilat or saline. When fluid-resistant hypotension (mean arterial pressure, <65 mmHg) developed, norepinephrine was given up to a maximal dose of 3 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1). The sublingual microcirculation was evaluated using sidestream dark-field videomicroscopy. A cutoff of 20 \u03bcm was used to differentiate small and large vessels. Experiments were pursued until the sheep's spontaneous death or for a maximum of 30 h. There were progressive and significant reductions in the proportion of small perfused vessels and in the microvascular flow index for small vessels (both P < 0.01 for trend) during shock and the first 2 h of norepinephrine infusion in the placebo group, which were prevented by the administration of enalaprilat. There were no differences between treated and placebo groups in global hemodynamic variables, time to shock or median survival time (21.8 [18.6-28.8] vs. 22.9 [21.8-30.0] h; P = 0.45). However, oxygen exchange was worse (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, 224 [128-297] vs. 332 [187-450]; P < 0.05), and creatinine concentrations increased more in the treated group (from 0.51 [0.42-0.75] to 1.19 [0.64-1.50] mg\u00b7dL(-1); P = 0.04) than in the control group (from 0.55 [0.45-0.62] to 0.78 [0.46-1.78] mg\u00b7dL(-1); P = 0.12), Enalaprilat therefore prevented the worsening of sublingual microcirculatory variables in this fluid-resuscitated, hyperdynamic model of septic shock, without significant effect on arterial pressure, but with a possible deleterious effect on renal and lung function.", 
    "421": "Even with the availability of novel and efficacious antihypertensive agents, an insufficient number of hypertensive patients achieve their desired blood pressure (BP) target. This failure is partly due to the fact that many patients do not strictly adhere to their drug therapy and/or they report the presence of adverse effects. Traditionally, monotherapy is used as first-line treatment to achieve BP targets; however, when this fails, combination therapy is then required. In light of the need to attain BP goals, combination therapy (especially fixed-dose) is currently recommended. The main advantages of combination therapy over monotherapy are not only that of reduced dose, improved efficacy and reduced adverse effects, but also of target protection and reduced cardiovascular (CV) risk. Therefore, the development of single-administration drug combinations should also improve patient adherence to therapy and therefore help in achieving BP control. Among the various combinations available, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been proven to be extremely effective, while also displaying good tolerability. Individually, both the third-generation CCB lercanidipine and the ACE inhibitor enalapril are effective antihypertensive agents. In addition, both of these agents also show other beneficial effects when administered as monotherapy. Of particular importance is the fact that when lercanidipine plus enalapril are administered in combination, they show synergism, thus providing added efficacy with reduced side effects. The present report provides an overview of the main clinical studies examining lercanidipine and enalapril administered as monotherapy, with particular focus on the potential renoprotective effects afforded by the fixed-dose combination lercanidipine-enalapril.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronic enalapril treatment on plasma glucose, insulin and lipid levels in response to neuroglucopenia. Male Holtzman rats (120-170 g) were chronically treated with enalapril (10 mg/kg per day) in the drinking water for two weeks.

The hyperglycaemic response to 2DG was not significantly changed by enalapril treatment. The enalapril-treated group exhibited a peak of plasma insulin higher than controls. Plasma triglyceride showed a significant increase only in the enalapril group after neuroglucopenic stress (p < 0.05).These data show that chronic enalapril treatment changes insulin and triglyceride responses to neuroglucopenia, suggesting an effect on glucose-induced insulin secretion and the storage of triglycerides.",

Many of these medications have been investigated in other diseases, including cancer. Cardiac glycosides and statins have advanced to clinical trial testing in cancer therapeutics, with variable success. Early observations in breast cancer were consistent with a more benign histologic phenotype among women taking digitalis compared to their counterparts who did not receive cardiac glycosides. Cardiac glycosides can induce apoptosis in cancer cells through various mechanisms and sensitize them to the effects of antitumor therapy. By blocking the generation of prenyl units, statins impair prenylation, an important posttranslational modification of proteins whose function depends on membrane anchoring. Statins also impair protein folding and N-glycosylation and inhibit the upregulation of cholesterol synthesis associated with chemotherapy resistance. Stress and catecholamine release promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, effects that can be mitigated by \u03b2-blockers. Components of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are expressed in various cancers and are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Angiotensin II has potent mitogenic and angiogenic properties that can be blocked with ACEIs and ARBs. Although it is unclear whether the promising preclinical activity of many cardiovascular medications has clinically meaningful implications beyond the benefit in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the prevention or improvement of prognosis of common malignancies with medications known to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is encouraging and deserves further clinical investigation.",

Both BNP and enalapril therapy produced higher heart tissue concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and lower expression levels of inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. These benefits were associated with lower phosphorylation levels of NF-\u03baB subunits I\u03baB\u03b1, p50 and p65.

    "438": "The translational path from pharmacological insight to effective therapy can be a long one. We aim to describe the management of Marfan syndrome as a case-example of how pharmacological and genomic insights can contribute to improved therapy. We undertook a literature search for studies of Marfan syndrome, to identify milestones in description, understanding and therapy of the syndrome. From the studies retrieved we then weaved an evidence-based description of progress. Marfan syndrome shows considerable heterogeneity in clinical presentation. It relies on defined clinical criteria with confirmation based on FBN1 mutation testing. Surgical advances have prolonged life in Marfan syndrome. First-line prophylaxis of complications with \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers became established on the basis that reduction of aortic pressure and heart rate would help. Over-activity of proteinases, first suggested in 1980, has since been confirmed by evidence of over-expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), notably MMP-2 and MMP-9. The search for MMP inhibitors led to the evaluation of doxycycline, and both animal studies and small trials, provided early evidence that this widely used antimicrobial agent was useful. Identification of the importance of TGF-\u03b2 led to evaluation of angiotensin II type I receptor (AT(1) R) blockers with highly promising results. Combination prophylactic therapy would appear rational. Pharmacological and genomic research has provided good evidence that therapy with losartan and doxycycline would prevent the aortic complications of Marfan syndrome. If on-going well designed trials confirm their efficacy, the outlook for Marfan syndrome patients would be improved considerably.", 
    "439": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linkedrecessive disorder caused by the absence of dystrophin. Cardiac dysfunction is a classical complication in this disease. Most DMD patients remain asymptomatic for years in spite of the progression of cardiac dysfunction because of their limited daily activities. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers may delay the onset and the progression of cardiac dysfunction and have to be recommended earlier in this disease.", 
    "440": "No current disease-modifying treatments have been shown definitively in randomized clinical trials to reduce or reverse diabetic sensory polyneuropathy (DSP). It is increasingly recognized that individuals with \"prediabetes\" or impaired glucose regulation can already have a \"small-fiber\" neuropathy, or mild DSP, in which sensory axons of both small and larger diameter are damaged. Small-fiber neuropathy is frequently associated with pain, and these patients may present to a neurologist for evaluation before the underlying glucose dysregulation has been diagnosed. It is important to identify these individuals, because aggressive diabetic control and lifestyle interventions can delay the onset of diabetes and may reverse small-fiber neuropathy associated with early diabetes mellitus. Although treatment currently focuses on pain associated with DSP, attention should be paid to potential risk factors for neuropathy. For example, glycemic control and hyperlipidemia should be improved with diet, exercise, and medications. Hypertension that is a risk marker for more severe neuropathy should be treated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers not only treat hypertension but also may directly reduce the progression of neuropathy. Class I or II clinical studies support the use of sodium valproate, pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, gabapentin, venlafaxine, opioids, and topical capsaicin in treating diabetic neuropathic pain. Pregabalin and gabapentin are relatively well tolerated and have few medication interactions. Sodium valproate has been shown to be effective but is not recommended for use in women of childbearing potential, and patients must be monitored for hepatotoxicity and thrombocytopenia. Tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline are often used for nocturnal pain but require caution in the elderly or anyone with cardiac disease. Venlafaxine and duloxetine successfully treat neuropathic pain independently of their effect on depression. Opioid medications are associated with a high rate of adverse effects but with careful monitoring, they can be effective in treating resistant neuropathic pain. Capsaicin is an effective topical treatment that lacks systemic side effects. The lidocaine patch is effective in relieving pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, but only class III evidence supports its use for diabetic neuropathic pain. No current Class I or II studies support other treatment modalities.",

This paper reports the findings of a posthoc analysis of the 1113 patients with diabetes mellitus in the ACTION trial: ACTION itself showed that outcomes in patients with stable angina and hypertension were significantly improved when a long-acting calcium channel blocking drug (nifedipine GITS) was added to their treatment regimens. This further analysis of the ACTION database in those patients with diabetes has identified a number of practical therapeutic issues which are still relevant because of potential outcome benefits, particularly in relation to BP control. For example, despite background CV treatment and, specifically, despite the widespread use of ACE Inhibitor drugs, the addition of nifedipine GITS was associated with significant benefits: improvement in BP control by an average of 6/3\u2009mmHg and significant improvements in outcome. In summary, this retrospective analysis has identified that the addition of nifedipine GITS resulted in improved BP control and significant outcome benefits in patients with diabetes who were at high CV risk. There is evidence to suggest that these findings are of direct relevance to current therapeutic practice.",

A combined therapy with enalapril (2.5 mg/day) and bisoprolol (1.25 mg/day) was initiated. After a slow increase in the dosage to 10 mg enalapril/day and 2.5 mg bisoprolol/day, systolic dysfunction resolved to a fractional shortening of 26% already after 7 months.",

    "447": "At 120 minutes after the captopril test ARR decreased in healthy subjects within a narrow range, but remained high in patients with PA and in patients with primary hypertension, especially for those with low renin characteristics. At 120 minutes after captopril, the range of ARR in primary hypertensive patients overlapped in 88% of the cases with the range of the ARR in the PA patients. Sensitivity and specificity of basal ARR and ARR after the captopril test to diagnose PA, calculated as receiver operator characteristics, showed an area under the curve of 0.595 for basal ARR and 0.664 for ARR at 120 minutes after the test.", 
    "448": "The ARR at 120 minutes after the captopril test is only marginally better than basal ARR in diagnosing PA in hypertensive patients screened with an increased ARR. Owing to an overall limited capacity to clearly discriminate PA from primary hypertension, the test could not therefore be recommended for the confirmatory diagnosis of PA.",

The decrease in 24-h BP with HCTZ dose 12.5 to 25 mg was systolic 6.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 5.3 to 7.7 mm Hg) and diastolic 4.5 mm Hg (95% confidence interval: 3.1 to 6.0 mm Hg) and was inferior compared with the 24-h BP reduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (mean BP reduction 12.9/7.7 mm Hg; p < 0.003), angiotensin-receptor blockers (mean BP reduction 13.3/7.8 mm Hg; p < 0.001), beta-blockers (mean BP reduction 11.2/8.5 mm Hg; p < 0.00001), and calcium antagonists (mean BP reduction 11.0/8.1 mm Hg; p < 0.05).

Because outcome data at this dose are lacking, HCTZ is an inappropriate first-line drug for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "459": "Despite improvements in blood pressure (BP) control, a substantial percentage of patients do not achieve target. The relative importance of determinants of poor BP control is unclear. Therefore, the authors conducted a post hoc exploratory analysis to assess determinants of BP control. Data were collected in 45 general practices, which enrolled patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Antihypertensive medication changes throughout the 6-month follow-up period were documented. Baseline and 6-month BPs were recorded. Of the 2030 patients analyzed, 320 had diabetes. Overall, 42% of patients did not achieve BP control. In multivariate analysis, failure to intensify therapy was identified as a significant independent predictor of lesser BP reduction. Of patients unable to reach target after 6 months, only 25% were prescribed \u2265 3 drugs. Patients with diabetes were significantly less likely to reach target than those without (26% vs 64%, P<.001). Antihypertensive therapy prescribed to patients with diabetes was only marginally more intensive than to those without. In patients with hypertension, whether with or without coexisting diabetes, poor BP control appears to be at least partially due to failure to uptitrate antihypertensive therapy. Clinical inertia is likely an important barrier to BP control.",

    "468": "Based on multiple randomized controlled trials performed in the last 20 years, drugs form the basis of treatment for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF). Despite solid evidence for their efficacy and safety and publication of detailed national and international guidelines many patients with HFREF remain, who are not at all or only insufficiently treated. Treatment goals include reduction of mortality and hospitalizations, improvement of symptoms and exercise tolerance as well as prevention of disease progression. ACE-inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers exert beneficial effects on all treatment goals and are therefore indicated in all patients with HFREF if tolerated. Diuretics allow control of fluid retention and maintenance of \"euvolemia\". Low-dose spironolactone can be considered in persistent moderate to severe (NYHA 3 - 4) HFREF despite treatment. Angiotensin receptor blockers are indicated for ACE-inhibitor intolerance or in addition to ACE-inhibitors and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers in case of persistent symptoms. Triple combination of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone antagonists should be avoided in view of the substantial risk of hyperkalemia. In current praxis digoxin is mainly used as an adjunctive agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation in combination with beta-adrenergic receptor blockers. Titration and maintenance of heart failure treatment requires continuous control of clinical parameters, renal function and electrolytes. It is recommended to use drugs and dosest hat have been shown to be effective in clinial trials. Despite the fact that heart failure is mainly a disease of the elderly, this population is underrepresented in clinical trials. The risk of side effects and drug-drug interactions is increased in elderly patients because of physiologic changes with age and frequent comorbidities with resultant polypharmacy.", 
    "469": "Drosophila Acer (Angiotensin-converting enzyme-related) encodes a member of the angiotensin-converting enzyme family of metallopeptidases that have important roles in the endocrine regulation of blood homeostasis in mammals. Acer is expressed in the embryonic heart of Drosophila and expression in the adult head appears to be regulated by two clock genes. To study the role of Acer in development and in circadian activity, we have generated Acer null mutants by imprecise excision of a P-element and have compared their development and circadian behaviour with that of wild-type flies with the same genetic background. We show that Acer is not required for normal development, but that night sleep, which is clock regulated, is disrupted in adult flies lacking ACER. Acer null adults have reduced night-time sleep and greater sleep fragmentation, but normal levels of daytime sleep. The quality of night sleep in flies fed inhibitors of ACER is affected in a very similar manner. We have shown, using specific antibodies, that ACER is present in the adult fat body of the head and abdomen, and is secreted into the haemolymph. ACER might therefore have a role in cleaving regulatory peptides involved in metabolism and activity behaviour. There are similarities with mammals, where ACE peptidases are also expressed in adipose tissue and are thought to be part of a signalling system linking metabolism with sleep.",

Facial flushing was reported by 29 donors, and was more likely associated with 2RBC than PLT procedures (3.0% vs. 1.3%, P = 0.03). Facial flushing with 2RBC donation was reported by eight of 72 (11%) donors on ACE inhibitors; and 14 of 667 (2%) donors who were not taking ACE inhibitors (P = 0.001). The incidence of facial flushing reactions with PLT donation was less than 2% whether donors reported ACEI inhibitor use or not.

A retrospective, nationwide audit of prescriptions (n = 2773) issued by primary care physicians (n = 194) of 20 health centres in Bahrain was carried out. Approximately one-quarter of prescriptions ordered by two-thirds of primary care physicians had errors. No significant differences with respect to overall errors were evident in prescriptions ordered by the family physicians and general practitioners. The most common error (in 8.0% of prescriptions) was prescribing \u03b2-blockers or diuretics (thiazide) or their combinations to patients on lipid-lowering drugs. Prescribing multiple antihypertensives, often with a similar mechanism, accounted for 2.2% errors: approximately half of these (1.45%) were two angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) co-prescribed and/or ACEIs plus angiotensin-II receptor blockers. In 0.7% of prescriptions, \u03b2-blockers were ordered to patients on salbutamol treatment. High-dose metformin (3 g/day) was prescribed to approximately 4% diabetic hypertensives; of these, many were elderly patients. Prescribing high-dose glibenclamide (median dose 15 mg) to the elderly accounted for 3.6% of the overall errors. Polypharmacy, such as aspirin along with an immediate-release dipyridamole, was prescribed occasionally (0.25%), particularly by the general practitioners (P = 0.0139). MPEs are common in primary care, in Bahrain. Some of these prescribing errors have the potential to harm patients.

Secondary analyses included the incidence of adverse events and compliance.", 
    "494": "A total of 8298 hypertensive patients entered the study: 56% with newly diagnosed hypertension and 44% with uncontrolled hypertension. Mean SBP/DBP decreased significantly from baseline (152.5\u2009 \u00b1 \u200910.8/89.5\u2009 \u00b1 \u20099\u2009mmHg) over 12 weeks (-18.5/-9.7\u2009mmHg; p\u2009<\u20090.001). At visit 2, 23% of patients were uptitrated to perindopril 8\u2009mg/day, which resulted in an additional mean 10.1/5.3\u2009mmHg BP reduction; this reduction was even greater (15.1/5.7\u2009mmHg) among a separate group of severely hypertensive patients (i.e. SBP >170\u2009mmHg or DBP >109\u2009mmHg at baseline). Target BP was achieved in 54% of the ITT population. Both perindopril 4\u2009mg/day and perindopril 8\u2009mg/day were well tolerated and compliance was high throughout the study.", 
    "495": "In the clinical outpatient setting, perindopril was found to be an effective dose-dependent and well tolerated antihypertensive treatment, with good compliance. Uptitration to the full therapeutic dosage of perindopril is an efficient approach for the management of a broad range of hypertensive patients without CAD.", 
    "496": "Control of cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, particularly hypertension, is still unsatisfactory, resulting in excess CV morbidity and mortality worldwide. CV risk is linearly associated with an increase in blood pressure (BP) values, and clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that BP lowering represents the most effective means of preventing CV events. However, while BP reduction is a fairly easy target, BP normalization is much more difficult to achieve, and adequate BP control (<140/90\u2009mmHg) is attained only in a small percentage of the hypertensive population. One of the main reasons for the lack of efficacy of antihypertensive pharmacological treatment is that very often drugs are not administered at the correct dosage. In this review, we discuss the importance of using clinical pharmacology to guide treatment of hypertension. Controlled clinical trials, including HOPE, EUROPA, and CONSENSUS, are used to guide prescribing decisions. Unfortunately, the results obtained in pivotal studies such as these have been obtained using drug dosages much higher than those usually used in clinical practice. The prescription of a drug for the treatment of hypertension should take into consideration the potency of the drug, i.e. the degree of BP reduction required, and the duration of action of the drug, i.e. the need to cover the dosing interval (possibly 24 hours) in a homogeneous way. This is especially the case for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, compounds characterized by a flat dose-response curve. The significance of this flat dose-response curve is that a low dose of an ACE inhibitor has the same potency as a high dose but a shorter duration of action. If a low dosage is administered to a hypertensive patient it causes BP fluctuations, which have been associated with negative CV outcomes. In contrast, other drug classes, including calcium channel antagonists, diuretics, and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists, can be used at different dosages in order to modulate their hemodynamic effects. Thus, it is important to be aware of the clinical pharmacology of antihypertensive drugs in order to choose not only the class or the molecule best suited to the clinical characteristics of the patient, but also the correct dosages to ensure effective and homogeneous 24-hour BP reduction.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of complex therapy with addition of Vasonat on the dynamics of remodeling indexes of left ventricle and functional class of CHF on classification of NYHA. It has been shown that application of metabolic modulator Vasonat in addition to conventional therapy of CHF facilitated the clinical improvement and significant decline of functional class. Vasonat use resulted in the meaningful improvement of the contractive function of myocardium and increase of tolerance to the physical exercise. Moreover, high efficiency of Vasonat has been demonstrated in the control of the syndrome of oxidizing stress, by decrease in intensity of free-radical processes and activation of the antioxidant defense system.",

We investigated the relationship between RAAS and hypoxia in the developing kidney. The expression of VEGF and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 related with the oxygen was analyzed in the enalapril- or spironolactone-treated neonatal rat kidneys. Enalapril (30 mg/kg/d) or spironolactone (200 mg/kg/d) was administered to newborn rat pups for 7 d. The newborn rats were injected i.p. with pimonidazole (200 mg/kg), a marker of severe tissue hypoxia, 1 h before killing. VEGF and HO-1 protein expression was significantly increased by immunoblots and immunohistochemistry in both the enalapril- and spironolactone-treated kidneys, compared with the controls (p < 0.05). HO-1 mRNA expression was increased in the spironolactone-treated group (p < 0.05). The immunoactivity of pimonidazole was not different from that of the controls in the enalapril-treated group, whereas it was increased in the spironolactone-treated group. The results of this study indicate that aldosterone blockade or angiotensin II inhibition in the developing rat kidney up-regulated renal VEGF and HO-1 expression regardless of the hypoxic conditions and may differentially modulate VEGF and HO-1 production.",

Epidemiological evidence suggests that antioxidants, including vitamins C and E, \u03b1-carotene, and \u03b2-carotene, may be therapeutic; however, interventional trials of antioxidants have provided mixed results, with some showing deleterious consequences. It is thus crucial that we consider the implications of trial design and execution, and further investigation of cellular pro-and antioxidant mechanisms is critical. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers reduce the generation of reactive oxygen species, in experimental models as well as in humans, and have demonstrated beneficial cardiovascular effects. Polyphenols and antioxidants contained in foods and beverages may also be cardioprotective. Recent studies suggest that the judicious development of antioxidant agents may provide an effective approach to quench oxidative stress in tissues and improve cardiovascular health.",

    "543": "Hypertension in kidney transplant recipients is a major \"traditional\" risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Importantly, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death and a major factor in death-censored graft failure in transplant recipients. The blood pressure achieved after transplant is related inversely to postoperative glomerular filtration rate (GFR), with many patients experiencing a significant improvement in blood pressure control with fewer medications within months of surgery. However, the benefits of improved GFR and fluid status may be affected by the immunosuppression regimen. Immunosuppressive agents affect hypertension through a variety of mechanisms, including catechol- and endothelin-induced vasoconstriction, abrogation of nitric oxide-induced vasodilatation, and sodium retention. Most notable is the role of calcineurin inhibitors in promoting hypertension, cyclosporine more so than tacrolimus. Additionally, the combination of calcineurin- and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-inhibitor therapy is synergistically nephrotoxic and promotes hypertension, whereas steroid withdrawal and minimization strategies seem to have little or no impact on hypertension. Other important causes of hypertension after transplant, beyond a progressive decrease in GFR, include transplant renal artery stenosis and sequelae of antibody-mediated rejection. Calcium channel blockers may be the most useful medication for mitigating calcineurin inhibitor-induced vasoconstriction, and use of such agents may be associated with improvements in GFR. Use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, remains an attractive strategy for many transplant recipients, although some recipients may have significant adverse effects associated with these medications, including decreased GFR, hyperkalemia, and anemia. In conclusion, hypertension control affects both patient and long-term transplant survival, and its best management requires careful analysis of causes and close monitoring of therapies.",

We hypothesized that hypertension is accompanied by enhanced TLR4 expression and activity. Cardiac TLR4 expression was determined in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY; 4, 8, 16 weeks). Besides, hearts of 8-week-old rats were stimulated with the endogenous TLR4 ligand heparansulfate (HS); the proinflammatory mRNA pattern was assessed (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1). Additionally, we induced hypertension in WKY by L-NAME (N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine-methylester hydrochloride). In both hypertension models the effect of ramipril on TLR4 density was assessed. Cardiac TLR4 distribution was investigated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Blood pressure (BP) and heart weight/body weight ratio (HW/BW) were elevated in SHR. Constitutive TLR4 expression was augmented in adolescent and adult, but not young SHR compared with WKY. TLR4 staining was pronounced in cardiomyocytes. HS entailed an aggravated TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA response in cardiac tissue, which was significantly pronounced in SHR. Ramipril (10 mg kg(-1) per day) reduced BP, HW/BW and TLR4 expression in SHR. L-NAME also augmented TLR4 expression in WKY. Ramipril (1 mg kg(-1) per day) lowered BP but TLR4 expression remained unaffected. High-dose ramipril (10 mg kg(-1) per day) however decreased TLR4 expression. Starting from adolescence SHR demonstrated enhanced cardiac TLR4 expression. TLR4 was also upregulated in L-NAME induced hypertension. Thus, enhanced TLR4 expression might be linked to the development and maintenance of hypertension. Finally, the antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory action of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition had no effect on TLR4 expression in therapeutic doses but in a high-dose model.",

Additionally, atrial fibrillation carries a significant risk of thrombo-embolic events, specifically cerebrovascular accident. Among the most prevalent risk factors for atrial fibrillation, hypertension not only has the strongest correlation but is also the most prevalent. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system represents a prime target for the treatment of hypertension through the use of angiotensin-converting enzymes inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. In addition to blood pressure control, these medications have been shown to reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. They have been shown to have effects at the cellular level in preventing atrial fibrosis. Additionally, these medications may prevent the development ofatrial fibrillation, reduce the duration of atrial fibrillation, and facilitate electrical cardioversion in patients with the arrhythmia. Therefore, patients with, or at risk for atrial fibrillation may benefit from treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists; deriving benefits from these medications beyond simple blood pressure control.", 
    "562": "Partial least squares regression method was used to analyze a peptide dataset and construct inhibitory models for renin-inhibitory natural dipeptides. The models were computed with the renin-inhibitory activity as dependent variable (Y) and the peptide structural properties as predictors (X); validation was conducted using cross-validation and permutation tests. The amino acid descriptors were based on the 3- and 5-z scales of 20 coded amino acids to produce models that explained 71.6% of Y with a 33.8% predictive ability and 75.2% of Y with a predictive power of 50.8%, respectively. In both models, low molecular size amino acids with hydrophobic side chains were preferred at the N-terminus, while amino acids with bulky side chains were preferred at the C-terminus for potency. Based on the 5-z model, four Trp (W)-containing antihypertensive dipeptides (IW, LW, VW and AW) were predicted as the most potent renin inhibitors. The peptides were synthesized and in vitro inhibition assay showed that IW and LW inhibited 70% (IC(50), 2.3 mM) and 37% renin activity at 3.2 mM, respectively, whereas VW and AW were inactive. There was no correlation between the observed renin-inhibitory activities and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activities of the dipeptides. We concluded that the structural similarities between isoleucine and leucine could have contributed to their distinct inhibitory activity when compared to alanine and valine. Therefore, IW may be a useful template for the development of advanced forms of highly active low molecular size antihypertensive peptides and peptidomimetics.",

Additional antiproteinuric effect in diabetic and non diabetic chronic kidney disease, and reduction in hospitalizations in patients with heart failure already receiving a single RAAS antagonist, has been achieved by incremental inhibition of the RAAS with dual therapy or uptitration of an individual agent above conventional dosages. However, the synergistic increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) and the angiotensin II escape could reduce the expected benefit obtained with dual therapy. Results from ONTARGET showing a lack of additional outcome benefit over monotherapy, with a concomitant increase risk of hyperkalemia, renal impairment, and hypotension, discourage the use of the ACEI/ARB combination in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. This occured despite a lower albumin excretion in dual versus single RAAS blockade, indicating that an incremental antiproteinuric effect is not automatically translated into clinical outcome benefits. The efficacy and safety of ACEI/ARB combination versus monotherapy in patients with overt proteinuria is currently evaluated by LIRICO and VA NEPHRON-D clinical trials. The long lasting direct renin inhibitor aliskiren, acting at the first and rate limiting step of the RAAS cascade, prevents the reactive increase in PRA when combined with ACEIs, ARBs or diuretics. The ASPIRE HIGHER programme, involving more than 35,000 patients with hypertension, heart failure, kidney disease and diabetes, is currently evaluating the efficacy and safety of aliskiren on top of standard therapy. The clinical benefit of adding mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (MRBs) in the control of resistant hypertension, proteinuric kidney diseases, and prevention of mortality in patients with heart failure on top of conventional treatment, evidences the pathogenic role of inadequately suppressed aldosterone as a cause of suboptimal response to conventional RAAS inhibition.

We reviewed the risk factors for recurrence, surgical procedures used, perioperative management, timing of operation, and medical treatment.",

The increased serum levels of C-reactive protein, TNF, VEGF, IL-6, and ICAM-1 were known in patients with COPD. The accelerated pulse wave velocity(PWV) and the increased intima-media thickness of internal jugular artery were significantly found in the patients, when compared with the smokers without COPD. The anti-atherogenic agents including statins and ARBs are reported to be effective for the reduced mortality in the patients. The possibility of COPD as a novel atherogenic factor is discussed.", 
    "599": "Atherosclerosis is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a major cause of death in these patients, especially, in patients with end-stage renal disease(ESRD). The pathological features in ESRD patients are intimal atherosclerosis and medial calcific sclerosis. The important risk factors for CVD in ESRD patients are hypertension, dyslipidemia and CKD bone and mineral disorder (CKD-MBD). Atherosclerosis has been evaluated by measurements of intima-media thickness and pulse-wave velocity. Although the target blood pressure still undetermined, hypertension would be treated with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors. In addition, treatment of dyslipidemia with statins may lead to favorable CVD outcome. Finally, inhibition of vascular calcification should be important by treatment with active vitamin D and sevelamer.",

Elevated blood pressure causes damage to the endothelium and vascular wall through both mechanical and humoral factors. We and others have shown that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system at a 'critical period' during the development of hypertension results in a permanent suppression of hypertension in animal models. We have also reported that high-dose renin-angiotensin inhibition results in regression of hypertension, possibly by regression of renal arteriolar hypertrophy. These results suggest that understanding the process of arterial remodeling may play a key role in the development of new strategies for prevention and regression of hypertension and arteriosclerosis.", 
    "601": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease of vascular wall initiated and amplified by oxidative stress. Evidence has accumulated over the past decade that angiotensin II (Ang II) induces oxidative stress in hypertension which is one of the major risk factors of atherosclerosis. Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can reduce oxidative stress and inflammation in hypertensive patients. As a result, ACEIs reduce major cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure, whereas it has not been elucidated whether ARBs might be more effective at reducing atherosclerosis than ACEIs or not. The recent meta-analysis have been leading to the answer that ARBs should be considered as baseline therapy in hypertension.",

Single cell suspensions obtained from day 7 human embryoid bodies (d7EBs) injected i.v. 1 hour after cecal ligation and puncture significantly reduced lung inflammation and edema as well as production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 in lungs compared with controls, whereas interleukin-10 production remained elevated. d7EB cell transplantation also reduced mortality to 50% from 90% in the control group. The protection was ascribed to d7EB cell interaction with lung resident CD11b+ cells, and was correlated with the ability of d7EB cells to reduce it also reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines by CD11+ cells, and to endothelial NO synthase-derived NO by d7EB cells, leading to inhibition of inducible macrophage-type NO synthase activation in CD11b+ cells. The protective progenitor cells were positive for the endothelial and hematopoietic lineage marker angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Only the ACE+ fraction modulated the proinflammatory profile of CD11b+ cells and reduced mortality in septic mice. In contrast to the nonprotective ACE-cell fraction, the ACE+ cell fraction also produced NO. These findings suggest that an ACE+ subset of human embryonic stem cell-derived progenitor cells has a highly specialized anti-inflammatory function that ameliorates sepsis-induced lung inflammation and reduces mortality.", 
    "610": "Antihypertensive drugs are prescribed to patients with CKD to slow down the rate of loss of residual kidney function; to reduce proteinuria, when present; and to protect other target organs from damage that is mediated by elevated blood pressure (BP). In most patients, a diuretic and a renin system blocking drug, such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor antagonist, or an aldosterone receptor antagonist are used. Often, 3 or more drugs are needed to achieve BP goals. Many drugs are eliminated through the kidney and in some cases dosage reductions are advisable to avoid adverse effects from high levels of medication. This article will review the various classes of antihypertensive drugs used in the management of high BP in patients with CKD, with an emphasis on pitfalls that arise when kidney function is impaired.",

The etiology of hypertension in diabetic nephropathy involves mechanisms with multiple inter-related mediators that result in renal sodium reabsorption and peripheral vasoconstriction. The management of hypertension in these patients is focused on treatments that target these mediators. Clinical trials have established that drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system should be used as first-line agents on the basis of their ability to slow down progression of kidney disease and lower albuminuria. There is further interest into how the combination of drugs that inhibit this pathway at multiple steps will contribute further to the management of hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. This article presents an updated review of the mechanisms involved in hypertension in patients with diabetic nephropathy. It also reviews the past clinical trials using single agents as therapeutics and the more recent trials involving novel drugs or drug combinations used to treat these patients. Retrospective analyses of multiple studies are included to better examine the significance of the currently proposed blood pressure targets for patients with diabetic nephropathy.",

Concomitant medication was registered and four groups of renal risk drugs were identified: metformin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), angiotensin-converting enzyme -inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and digoxin. Descriptive statistics and the Kappa test for concordance were used.",

My first goal is to prove intolerance of traditional therapies for heart failure by challenging patients with various medication combinations, including staggered dosing regimens and alternatives to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/\u03b2-blockers, and by considering cardiac resynchronization therapy if they meet criteria. As patients develop progressive hypotension and side effects from medicines, I often will discontinue these medicines after careful communication. For patients with refractory heart failure, I consider cardiac transplantation for those who are candidates and left ventricular assist device as destination therapy for those who are not transplant candidates, both of which require multidisciplinary input from psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, and cardiac surgeons. If patients are not candidates for these advanced therapies, I try to delineate their goals for living and discuss strategies to maximize their survival (however limited) and increase my focus on their quality of life by minimizing unnecessary testing. For the select patient, I use continuous inotrope support only if this improves their quality of life and possibility of having a meaningful existence outside of the hospital. Palliative care consultants are often involved at this stage. For the patient who is clearly at the end of life, I refer to hospice and focus on comfort. Return ambulatory visits and extent of the care received are guided by the preferences of the patient and their family. When there are disparate views of family members, especially when the patient is not cognitively able to participate in the discussion, I tend to be more paternalistic in my approach to therapeutic options in an attempt to possibly dissipate family dynamic problems occurring after the patient dies.",

On the top of these results, we have recently reported that the hydrolysate of milk casein containing both VPP and IPP improved the vascular endothelial function of subjects with stage I hypertension, enforcing us to elucidate the mechanism of the improvement of endothelial dysfunction by these peptides. For this purpose, we examined the effect of VPP and IPP on induction of nitric oxide (NO) production using cultured vascular endothelial cells and isolated arterial vessels. When both VPP and IPP were added to the medium of cultured endothelial cells at final concentrations of more than 100 nmol/l, the NO(x) (NO(2) and NO(3)) concentration in the medium was significantly higher than that of the control. Moreover, both VPP and IPP induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings, and these effects were inhibited by NO synthase inhibitors, K channel inhibitors, and bradykinin B2 receptor antagonists. These lines of results suggested that both VPP and IPP induced production of vasodilative substances including NO.",

Cardiac complications can occur years after exposure to anthracyclines and are a leading cause of noncancerous morbidity and mortality in this population. The mechanism of its cardiotoxicity is not completely known, although oxidative stress is believed to play a significant role. This pathway and other nonoxidative mechanisms are reviewed. Several risk factors such as age, dose, female gender, and concomitant radiation therapy are known, but the relative risks of many comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension are not well studied. No standard, evidence-based guidelines for appropriate screening methods to detect cardiotoxicity exist. Periodic imaging with echocardiography or radionuclide angiography is appropriately recommended for long-term survivors but is of limited use during therapy. Biomarkers such as cardiac troponins and brain natriuretic peptides may aid in detecting cardiotoxicity. Studies investigating the use of agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors and beta-blockers to treat anthracycline cardiotoxicity have shown promise, but more data are needed. Structural analogs such as epirubicin were developed to minimize cardiotoxicity but have not sufficiently reduced it. Liposome-encapsulated anthracyclines have shown a considerable decrease of cardiotoxicity in adults without sacrificing efficacy, but the data related to children are sparse. The only agent proven to be cardioprotective is the iron chelator, dexrazoxane. Studies have shown that dexrazoxane is safe and significantly reduces the incidence of cardiotoxicity. Dexrazoxane should be considered for pediatric oncology protocols using anthracyclines that include longitudinal assessment.",

    "621": "Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), which is frequently prescribed in patients with glomerulonephritis (GN), is suggested to increase the risk of cancer. We registered 3,288 patients with renal biopsy and analyzed the relationship between the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockade and the incidence of cancer or cancer mortality. After renal biopsy, cancer developed in 33 patients with an incidence rate of 1.0% (95% of CI for incidence: 0.7%-1.3%). There was no difference in the cancer incidence among the groups according to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or ARB: 1.2% in the None (23/1960), 0.7% in the ARB-only (5/748), 0.4% in the ACEI-only (1/247), and 1.2% in the ACEI-ARB (4/333) (P = 0.487) groups. The cancer mortality was 2.1%, 0.4%, 0.0%, and 0.3% in None, ACEI-only, ARB-only, and ACEI-ARB group, respectively (P < 0.001). The risk of cancer mortality in patients with ARB was only 0.124 (0.034-0.445) compared to that of non-users of ARB by Cox's hazard proportional analysis. In conclusion, prescription of ACEI or ARB in patients with GN does not increase cancer incidence and recipients of ARB show rather lower rates of all-cause mortality and cancer mortality.",

    "626": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a chronic lung disease with poor diagnosis and limited therapeutic options. The currently available therapies are ineffective in improving the quality of life and reducing mortality rates. There exists a clear unmet medical need to treat this disease, which necessitates the discovery of novel therapeutic targets/agents for safe and successful therapy. An altered renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been implicated as a causative factor in the pathogenesis of PAH. Angiotensin II (Ang II), a key effector peptide of the RAS, can exert deleterious effects on the pulmonary vasculature resulting in vasoconstriction, proliferation, and inflammation, all of which contribute to PAH development. Recently, a new member of the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), was discovered. This enzyme functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system by metabolizing Ang II to a putative protective peptide, angiotensin-(1-7). ACE2 is abundantly expressed in the lung tissue and emerging evidence suggests a beneficial role for this enzyme against lung diseases. In this review, we focus on ACE2 in relation to pulmonary hypertension and provide proof of principle for its therapeutic role in PAH.", 
    "627": "Hypertension is a common co-morbidity and a frequent complication in liver transplant patients. The aim of this paper is to concisely review available clinical data and propose a hypertension treatment algorithm in liver transplant patients. Calcium channel blockers are mainstay of the treatment due to their potent vasodilatory effects. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferable due to their least interaction with cytochrome P450 enzyme system and, therefore, minimal risk of potential disruption of immunosuppressive drug levels. Beta-blockers may be considered first line drugs in patients with resting tachycardia and in those with high cardiac outputs. Data support the use of beta-blockers for patients intolerant or unresponsive to calcium channel blockers. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have little value when used early after liver transplant but may have a more pronounced role during the later periods. Diuretics may be of value in combination with other drugs, especially to counteract the potassium-retaining effects of calcineurin inhibitors. Treatment of post liver transplantation hypertension in patients with co-morbid conditions such as coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and renal disease will likely require combination therapy.",

Whether these agents induce pleiotropic effects that promote the amelioration of vascular disorders independent of blood pressure reduction remains controversial. This review examines preclinical and clinical data that highlight a potentially important role for ARBs in several common vascular disorders, including cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal, and metabolic disorders. The preponderance of evidence suggests that some of the benefits derived from ARBs might improve outcomes in these disorders by actions that extend beyond blood pressure reduction.

    "633": "Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been a highly successful therapeutic approach for the prevention of hypertension-related end organ damage. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers lower blood pressure and reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with cardiovascular and kidney disease. However, progression to end-stage disease remains common in these patient populations. A compensatory increase in plasma renin activity occurs with the use of either angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers, thus causing increased levels of angiotensin II, which may limit the therapeutic effectiveness of these agents. The direct renin inhibitor, aliskiren, suppresses the renin-angiotensin system by inhibiting its first and rate-limiting step. This early inhibition reduces the production of all downstream components of the system. In this review, recent clinically relevant advances in the understanding of renin-angiotensin system biology are explored as a rationale for combining aliskiren with other blockers of the renin-angiotensin system. These combinations more fully inhibit the renin-angiotensin system, with the goal of providing additional therapeutic benefits in diseases associated with chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin system.",

In a multivariate model, including age, time from transplantation to conversion, pre-conversion glomerular filtration rate, presence of diabetes and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker (ACEI/ARB) therapy, the rate of decline in renal function was related only to the presence of diabetes (p = 0.017) and inversely related to the use of ACEI/ARB therapy (p = 0.003).

    "642": "In atrial fibrillation (AF), the absence of a clear benefit of a rhythm-control strategy over a rate-control strategy seen in recent trials may be due to the fact that many of the usual antiarrhythmic strategy have significant weaknesses. Besides research efforts to improve the efficacy and safety of conventional antiarrhythmic agents, therapies directed 'upstream'of the electrical aspects of AF, towards the underlying anatomical substrate and atrial remodelling, have been proposed as new pharmacological therapeutic approaches. Potential upstream therapies for AF comprise a variety of agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), statins, N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and steroids. On the basis of experimental data, clinical studies have provided information on the potential of upstream therapy for the prevention of AF across a broad spectrum of cardiovascular patient groups. In patients with heart failure or hypertension, data are sufficient to support the use of ACEI or ARB as treatment that may decrease the risk of AF beyond their other beneficial effects. Similarly, it is highly possible that the use of statin in patients with a recognized indication may be associated with a benefit against AF. However, in most clinical settings, the evidence appears to be insufficient to drive changes in therapy management per se, and large-scale, randomized controlled trials with adequately defined endpoints are still needed. The results from these trials may help to understand the complex mechanisms that lead to AF, and may clarify the benefit-to-risk ratio of these new therapeutic approaches.",

    "648": "Before the introduction of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors in the 1980s, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were the only class of drugs available for the reduction of symptomatic proteinuria. Long-term data from those days suggested sustained renoprotective properties in proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD), but this potential has not been further explored, due to the adverse effects of NSAIDs, and due to the successful introduction of RAAS blockade for blood pressure control and renoprotection. The renoprotective potential of NSAIDs may seem surprising for the present generation of clinicians, as NSAIDs are well known for their adverse effects on the kidney. Interestingly, the newer selective COX-2 inhibitors (coxibs), such as non-selective (ns) NSAIDs, exert an antiproteinuric effect in CKD patients. This review discusses the role of NSAIDs as a class of drugs representing an old concept for renoprotection in the light of current insights on renoprotection. It has become increasingly clear during the last two decades, from evidence obtained almost exclusively in studies using RAAS blockade, that not only reduction of blood pressure, but also of proteinuria is a prerequisite for long-term renoprotection. Ns-NSAIDs and coxibs reduce proteinuria without reduction of blood pressure. Their possible role as an adjunct in individualised treatment strategies, particularly for individual patients resistant or intolerant to current therapy, will be discussed.",

Beginning in childhood, patients with SCD develop a urinary concentrating defect resulting in polyuria and a predisposition to nocturnal enuresis and dehydration. The current model of sickle cell nephropathy suggests that destruction of the renal medulla induces production of renal vasodilating substances that feedback to the glomerulus causing hyperfiltration. Hyperfiltration leads to glomerulosclerosis and proteinuria, with eventual reduction in kidney function. The crucial steps of vasodilating substance production and hyperfiltration in children with SCD have not been proven. Treatment of sickle cell nephropathy is aimed at the reduction of proteinuria with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Hydroxyurea and chronic transfusion therapy may also alter the progression of sickle cell nephropathy in children. Further studies are needed to identify an accurate model and effective treatments for sickle cell nephropathy.",

Here, we retrospectively examined the efficacy of treatment for HSPN. Renal biopsy was performed in patients with nephrotic syndrome or persistent proteinuria for more than 3 months and patients were classified by treatment. Patients (n=31) with moderately severe HSPN (histological grade I-III and serum albumin [Alb] >2.5 g/dl) were treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers.

Cutaneous SP challenges produced the expected, dose-dependent flare and wheal response, while eliciting mild to moderate local pain sensation with little dose dependency. However, no differences were shown in the responses observed under sitagliptin compared with placebo, while the study would have been sufficiently powered to detect a clinically relevant increase in sensitivity to SP.

    "709": "The incidence of hypertension in the pediatric population has been increasing secondary to lifestyle changes in children and adolescents. Recent studies have enhanced our understanding of the treatment of pediatric hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have traditionally been the most commonly used class of medication in children with hypertension. This is partly due to the important role of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system pathway in the mediation of pediatric hypertension. Angiotensin receptor blockers provide a reasonable alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The need for better tolerated antihypertensives had led to development of many new antihypertensives. Valsartan is a relatively novel angiotensin receptor blocker that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of pediatric hypertension. Two recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy of valsartan monotherapy in the pediatric population aged 1-16 years. Once-daily oral preparations of valsartan achieve adequate blood pressure control in the pediatric population. Lack of generic formulations is an important disadvantage. Plasma levels are predictable and clearance is primarily by the liver. Valsartan should be prescribed cautiously for sexually active adolescent females due to concern about angiotensin receptor blocker fetopathy. Otherwise, the drug has infrequent side effects. In summary, valsartan is a new and useful alternative to conventional antihypertensive therapy in pediatric population.",

Women were significantly less likely to have ischemic chest pain, ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-STEMI and were more likely to have dyspnea, unstable angina, ST depression and left bundle branch block. Both groups received ACS medications and cardiac catheterization equally; however, women received anticoagulants (88% vs. 79%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) (70% vs. 65%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.050) more and clopidogrel less (20% vs. 29%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

India is projected to have 62 million CAD patients by 2015, with nearly 1/3rd of this burden shared by patients younger than 40 years. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in blood pressure (BP) regulation and fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis. Activation of RAAS has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and benefits of inhibition of RAAS as an effective way to intervene in the pathogenesis of AMI is well documented. In the setting of AMI, angiotensin-II plays a significant detrimental role, contributing to cardiac remodeling, a process that predisposes to subsequent arrhythmia and cardiac failure. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEls) play a key role in the clinical management of several cardiovascular disease (CVD)s such as AMI, by inhibiting the actions of angiotensin-II, ACEIs would be expected to modify unwanted post-AMI events. ACEIs trials have tested AMI patients with two different approaches: selective (those with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) treated over a long-term) and relatively unselective (those treated early over the course and for a short-period, up to 6 weeks). In general, results are consistent and beneficial as regards to reduction in both short-term & long-term mortality and heart failure. There are evidences that suggest yielding of an extra protection (reduced mortality and occurrence of severe LVD) with early introduction of ACEIs in the course of AMI. Trials have also shown ACEIs effective and consistent protection against re-infarction and management of arrhythmias after AMI. Large clinical trials have proven ACEIs to be superior to ARB, in preventing CV deaths in high-risk AMI subjects. They have proven to be safe & effective in diabetic & older population. With wealth of evidence available supporting use of ACEIs in patients with MI, The use of ACEIs in AMI has moved form experimental to standard therapy.", 
    "715": "The identification of biomarkers of anti-angiogenic therapy that predict clinical benefit is of vital importance. We previously reported that a combination treatment with clinically available safe agents, specifically angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) and vitamin K (VK), inhibited the cumulative recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via suppression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The present study aimed to identify non-invasive biological markers that predict the clinically beneficial effect of this combination regimen. A combination of ACE-I (perindopril; 4 mg/day) and VK (menatetrenone; 45 mg/day) was administered for 54 months following curative therapy for HCC. The cumulative recurrence and several indices, which are reportedly considered as biological markers of anti-angiogenic therapies, were analyzed. The combined treatment of ACE-I and VK markedly inhibited the cumulative recurrence of HCC during the 54-month follow-up. The serum VEGF and soluble VEGF receptor (sVEGFR)-2 were significantly suppressed with this combination regimen, whereas sVEGFR-1 was not. In HCC patients without recurrence, a significant suppression of VEGF and sVEGFR-2 was achieved within 6 and 3 months after treatment, respectively. In conclusion, the combination treatment of ACE-I and VK is a potentially novel anti-angiogenic strategy for secondary chemoprevention against HCC since the two agents are widely used in clinical practice without serious side effects. Furthermore, sVEGFR-2 may become a useful clinical predictive marker of this combination treatment.",

    "726": "Altitude illness refers to a group of environmentally mediated pathophysiologies. Many people will suffer acute mountain sickness shortly after rapidly ascending to a moderately hypoxic environment, and an unfortunate few will develop potentially fatal conditions such as high altitude pulmonary edema or high altitude cerebral edema. Some individuals seem to be predisposed to developing altitude illness, suggesting an innate contribution to susceptibility. The implication that there are altitude-sensitive and altitude-tolerant individuals has stimulated much research into the contribution of a genetic background to the efficacy of altitude acclimatization. Although the effect of altitude attained and rate of ascent on the etiology of altitude illness is well known, there are only tantalizing, but rapidly accumulating, clues to the genes that may be involved. In 2006, we reviewed what was then known about the genetics of altitude illness. This article updates that review and attempts to tabulate all the available genetic data pertaining to these conditions. To date, 58 genes have been investigated for a role in altitude illness. Of these, 17 have shown some association with the susceptibility to, or the severity of, these conditions, although in many cases the effect size is small or variable. Caution is recommended when evaluating the genes for which no association was detected, because a number of the investigations reviewed in this article were insufficiently powered to detect small effects. No study has demonstrated a clear-cut altitude illness gene, but the accumulating data are consistent with a polygenic condition with a strong environmental component. The genes that have shown an association affect a variety of biological pathways, suggesting that either multiple systems are involved in altitude pathophysiology or that gene-gene interactions play a role. Although numerous studies have been performed to investigate specific genes, few have looked for evidence of heritability or familial transmission, or for epidemiological patterns that would be consistent with genetically influenced conditions. Future trends, such as genome-wide association studies and epigenetic analysis, should lead to enhanced understanding of the complex interactions within the genome and between the genome and hypoxic environments that contribute to an individual's capacity to acclimatize rapidly and effectively to altitude.", 
    "727": "The treatment goal of patients with arterial hypertension is to reduce the blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg with the aim to lower the risk of subsequent cardiovascular diseases and to prolong patient's longevity. There are five main classes for blood pressure treatment: ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and thiazide diuretics. All these antihypertensive drugs have in common that they are able to lower the arterial blood pressure in a similar range. If drugs have similar effects, those with additional beneficial effects on patient's comorbidity should be preferred. Some antihypertensive drugs such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system (RAAS) additionally have organ protective properties. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should be preferred in patients with a high cardiovascular risk such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. A preferred approach is the initial prescription of a low dose combination to bring more hypertensive patients to their target blood pressure. Most combination drugs contain a thiazide diuretic. A better combination especially for diabetics seems to be a calcium channel blocker together with a RAAS inhibitor. A possible combination for patients with coronary heart disease or heart failure is a RAAS inhibitor combined with a beta-receptor blocker.",

There was a small difference in clinic systolic blood pressure between the treatment arms favoring benazepril plus amlodipine. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring provides a more rigorous estimate of blood pressure effects. A subset of 573 subjects underwent ambulatory blood pressure monitoring during year 2. Readings were obtained every 20 minutes during a 24-hour period. Between-treatment differences (benazepril plus amlodipine versus benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide) in mean values were analyzed using ANOVA. Treatment comparisons with respect to categorical variables were made using Pearson's \u03c7\u00b2. At year 2, the treatment groups did not differ significantly in 24-hour mean daytime or nighttime blood pressures (values of 123.9, 125.9, and 118.1 mm Hg for benazepril plus amlodipine group versus 122.3, 124.1, and 116.9 for the benazepril plus hydrochlorothiazide group), with mean between-group differences of 1.6, 1.8, and 1.2 mm Hg, respectively. Blood pressure control rates (24-hour mean systolic blood pressure <130 mm Hg on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring) were greater than 80% in both groups. Nighttime systolic blood pressure provided additional risk prediction after adjusting for the effects of drugs. The 24-hour blood pressure control was similar in both treatment arms, supporting the interpretation that the difference in cardiovascular outcomes favoring a renin angiotensin system blocker combined with amlodipine rather than hydrochlorothiazide shown in the ACCOMPLISH trial was not caused by differences in blood pressure, but instead intrinsic properties (metabolic or hemodynamic) of the combination therapies.",

However, the mechanism regulating this effect appears to be complex and poorly understood. Our aim was to investigate whether or not ACE2 ameliorates the profibrotic effects of Ang II-mediated, Akt-dependent pathways in the mouse mesangial cell line, MES-13.Gene transfer of ACE2 suppressed Ang II-activated Akt-phosphorylation, accompanied by a decreased level of collagen type I in cells. In addition, Ang II-induced collagen type I synthesis in MES-13s by activating the Ang II/AT-1R-PI3K pathway. This transactivation was dependent on cAMP/Epac but not on PKA. TGF-\u03b2RI played a pivotal role in this signaling pathway inducing collagen deposition effects which could be reversed by ACE2 gene transfer in MES-13 cells. The results revealed that gene transfer of ACE2 regulated Ang II-mediated AT1R-TGF\u03b2RI-PI3K-Akt signaling and involved the synthesis of collagen. The beneficial effect of ACE2 overexpression appeared to result mainly from blocking phosphorylation of Akt in mesangial cells, suggesting that the ACE2 gene might be a novel therapeutic target for glomerular diseases.",

Despite the lack of evidence on safety and efficacy in most disease states, dual therapy has been embraced as a treatment option. Most studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) combination therapy in the treatment of hypertension have limitations. In contrast, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in systolic heart failure has been addressed in several large randomized controlled trials. Until recently, there has been limited and conflicting evidence for the use of combination therapy for the prevention or management of nephropathy. Based on the new evidence, combination ACE inhibitor-ARB therapy in the treatment and management of hypertension, heart failure, and nephropathy should be limited.",

ACE also cleaves the terminal dipeptide of vasodilating hormone bradykinin (a nonapeptide) to inactivate this hormone. Therefore, inhibition of ACE is generally used as one of the methods for the treatment of hypertension. 'Oxidative stress' is another disease state caused by an imbalance in the production of oxidants and antioxidants. A number of studies suggest that hypertension and oxidative stress are interdependent. Therefore, ACE inhibitors having antioxidant property are considered beneficial for the treatment of hypertension. As selenium compounds are known to exhibit better antioxidant behavior than their sulfur analogues, we have synthesized a number of selenium analogues of captopril, an ACE inhibitor used as an antihypertensive drug. The selenium analogues of captopril not only inhibit ACE activity but also effectively scavenge peroxynitrite, a strong oxidant found in vivo.",

To determine whether this is due to inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, as seen with other flavanoid-rich foods, we fed blueberries to SHRSP and normotensive rats and analyzed ACE activity in blood and tissues. After 2 weeks on a control diet, the hypertensive rats showed 56% higher levels of ACE activity in blood as compared with the normotensive rats (p < 0.05). Feeding a 3% blueberry diet for 2 weeks lowered ACE activity in the SHRSP (p < 0.05) but not the normotensive rats. ACE activity in plasma of SHRSP was no longer elevated at weeks 4 and 6, but blueberry feeding inhibited ACE in SHRSP after 6 weeks. Blueberry diets had no effect on ACE activity in lung, testis, kidney, or aorta. Our results suggest that dietary blueberries may be effective in managing early stages of hypertension, partially due to an inhibition of soluble ACE activity.",

It has been hypothesized that the ARCN may be one of the sites of cardiovascular actions of angiotensins (ANGs). Experiments were carried out in urethane-anesthetized, artificially ventilated, adult male Wistar rats. The ARCN was identified by microinjections of N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA; 10 mM). Microinjections (50 nl) of ANG-(1-12) (1 mM) into the ARCN elicited increases in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and greater splanchnic nerve activity (GSNA). The tachycardic responses to ANG-(1-12) were attenuated by bilateral vagotomy. The cardiovascular responses elicited by ANG-(1-12) were attenuated by microinjections of ANG II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) antagonists but not ANG type 2 receptor (AT(2)R) antagonist. Combined inhibition of ANG-converting enzyme (ACE) and chymase in the ARCN abolished ANG-(1-12)-induced responses. Microinjections of ANG II (1 mM) into the ARCN also increased MAP and HR. Inhibition of ARCN by microinjections of muscimol (1 mM) attenuated the pressor and tachycardic responses to intravenously administered ANG-(1-12) and ANG II (300 pmol/kg each). These results indicated that 1) microinjections of ANG-(1-12) into the ARCN elicited increases in MAP, HR, and GSNA; 2) HR responses were mediated via both sympathetic and vagus nerves; 3) AT(1)Rs, but not AT(2)Rs, in the ARCN mediated ANG-(1-12)-induced responses; 4) both ACE and chymase were needed to convert ANG-(1-12) to ANG II in the ARCN; and 5) ARCN plays a role in mediating the cardiovascular responses to circulating ANGs.",

Nowadays, more Bj-PROs have been identified with higher ACE inhibition potency compared to Bj-PRO-5a. However, despite its modest inhibitory effect of ACE inhibition, Bj-PRO-5a reveals strong bradykinin-potentiating activity, suggesting the participation of other mechanisms for this peptide. In the present study, we have shown that Bj-PRO-5a induced nitric oxide (NO) production depended on muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 subtype (mAchR-M1) and bradykinin B\u2082 receptor activation, as measured by a chemiluminescence assay using a NO analyzer. Intravital microscopy based on transillumination of mice cremaster muscle also showed that both bradykinin B\u2082 receptor and mAchR-M1 contributed to the vasodilatation induced by Bj-PRO-5a. Moreover, Bj-PRO-5a-mediated vasodilatation was completely blocked in the presence of a NO synthase inhibitor.

Radiation therapy can also lead to coronary artery disease and fibrotic changes to the valves, pericardium, and myocardium. All patients being considered for chemotherapy, especially those who have prior cardiac history, should undergo detailed cardiovascular evaluation to optimize the treatment. Serial assessment of left ventricular systolic function and cardiac biomarkers might also be considered in selected patient populations. Cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapy might be decreased by the concurrent use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or beta-blockers.

    "761": "Betablockers (BB) have been recognized as effective antihypertensive agents. Recent meta analysis of various hypertension trials have brought to light the inferiority of BB compared to other antihypertensives as a first line monotherapy agent. Combination of BB with dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blocker (CCB) has been especially effective in smooth control of BP. Combination of diuretics with BB should be avoided in patients with dyslipidaemia and in those prone to develop diabetes. BB can be combined with vasodilators and alpha blockers with good therapeutic benefit. BB with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) is not an ideal combination as both the drugs act in the renin-angiotensin system. However, in hypertension with certain specific clinical situation this combination is useful. BB as a monotherapy agent is being less preferred in the treatment of hypertension based on recent evidence while in suitable combination it is a valuable antihypertensive.", 
    "762": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) particularly in hypertensive patients is a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events. Identifying LVH not only helps in the prognostication but also in the choice of therapeutic drugs. The prevalence of LVH is age linked and has a direct correlation to the severity of hypertension. Adequate control of blood pressure, most importantly central aortic pressure and blocking the effects of cardiomyocyte stimulatory growth factors like Angiotensin II helps in regression of LVH. Among the various antihypertensives ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are more potent than other drugs in regressing LVH. Beta blockers especially the newer cardio selective ones do still have a role in regressing LVH albeit a minor one. A meta-analysis of various studies on LVH regression shows many lacunae. There have been no consistent criteria for defining LVH and documenting LVH regression. This article reviews current evidence on the role of Beta Blockers in LVH regression.",

Subsequently BB proved to be beneficial in post-thrombolytic MI in long-term use. In stable angina BB gives good symptomatic relief primarily by reducing myocardial oxygen demand. In the set-up of unstable angina/non-ST elevation MI they prevent arrhythmia and progression to ST elevation MI. BB have also been shown to retard the progression of atherosclerosis. In congestive cardiac failure (CCF) they are now the first-line drugs with ACE inhibitors to impart prognostic benefit. Their role in improving outcome of cardiac and non-cardiac surgeries has found good evidence and recommendation. But in the field where BB have scored maximally, ie, in hypertension, their role is recently debated. But the unchallenged fact remains that in presence of any form of coronary artery disease, BB are the most preferred class of drugs to treat hypertension.", 
    "764": "The life-time risk of developing HF is about 20% (40% if hypertension present). With increasing longevity in the developed world the burden of HF (hospitalisation) is set to increase over the next 10-20 years. CAD and hypertension are the two main causes of HF; CAD (and obesity) in the case of systolic HF and hypertension in the case of diastolic HF (mainly in the elderly). BB have become the corner-stone (alongside ACE-inhibitors) in the treatment of systolic HF. Bisoprolol, metoprolol and carvedilol (on an ACE-inhibitor background) have reduced all-cause death by 34-5%. The presence of intrinsic sympathomemetic activity (xamoterol, bucindolol, nebivolol) diminishes efficacy in the treatment of systolic HF. First-line bisoprolol has proved \"non-inferior\" to first-line enalapril in reducing all-cause death and is probably superior in reducing sudden death. The main mode of action of BB in treating systolic HF is inhibition of chronic beta-1 stimulation-induced myocardial apoptosis/necrosis/inflammation. The combination of pure beta-1 blockade (low-dose bisoprolol) and pure beta-2 blockade (clenbuterol) may prove invaluable in the treatment of end-stage systolic HF (thus avoiding cardiac transplantation). The appropriate treatment of diastolic HF has yet to be determined. Beta-blockade is effective in the prevention of HF i) in the post-MI period and ii) as first-line agents in the treatment of young/middle-aged hypertension and as second-line agents (to first-line diuretics) in the treatment of elderly systolic hypertension. BB are highly effective in reversing LVH in young/middle-aged hypertensives (LVH pre-disposes to HF in young/middle-aged hypertension) and are (bisoprolol) at least as good as ACE-inhibitors. Choice of BB is important as benefit is not a class-effect. ISA (xamoterol, bucindolol, nebivolol) markedly diminishes efficacy. The choice is between bisoprolol, metoprolol succinate and carvedilol for optimal efficacy. Adverse reactions are associated, mainly, with beta-2 blockade and alpha-blockade. Thus non-selective (e.g. propranolol) or modestly beta-1 selective (e.g. metoprolol, atenolol) are associated with metabolic disturbance, bronchospasm, epinephrine/hypertensive interaction (with cigarette-smoking or insulin-induced hypoglycaemia), while the possession of alpha-blocking activity (e.g. carvedilol) is associated with dizziness and postural hypotension. The possession of beta-2 blockade, particularly if combined with alpha-blockade, is associated with an increased occurrence of sexual dysfunction. Lipophilic BB like propranolol and metoprolol appear in high concentrations in human brain tissue and are associated with side-effects such as insomnia, dreams and nightmares.", 
    "765": "Hypertension is a major public health problem and leading cause for diseases involving cardiovascular & renal system. It is fourth largest contributor for premature deaths in developed countries and seventh largest in developing world. The major pharmacological strategies currently utilized for hypertension management include volume control with diuretics, suppression of central and peripheral sympathetic nervous system activity, vasodilatation with ion channel manipulation and blockade of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and renal disease is well established. It also has been established that inhibition of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, is an effective way to intervene with pathogenesis of these disorders. Therapies like beta blockers, renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and aldosterone inhibitors, that inhibit renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system have proven to be highly successful for treatment of hypertension & related cardiovascular diseases. Renin inhibitors block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system at its origin, and thus offer a new approach to pharmacotherapy of Hypertension. Aliskiren is the first in a new class of orally active, non-peptide, low molecular weight direct renin inhibitor available for clinical use and potential new approach to the blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

    "766": "Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic infection that primarily affects residents of tropical regions, but causes infections in animals and humans in temperate regions as well. The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira, which also includes non-pathogenic, saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, non-specific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans, however, did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that, through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells, the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function, promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition, supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis.", 
    "767": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of imidapril and candesartan on fibrinolysis and insulin sensitivity in normoweight hypertensive patients. After a 2-week wash-out period, 61 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension were randomized to imidapril or candesartan for 12 weeks. Blood pressure (BP), plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen activities were evaluated at baseline and during treatment. The patients underwent a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (insulin sensitivity was evaluated as glucose infusion rate during the last 30\u2009min) and a desmopressin test (with desmopressin infusion in the brachial artery) to evaluate endothelial ability to release t-PA. Imidapril and candesartan induced similar systolic/diastolic BP reductions (-16/12.6 and -16.1/12.2\u2009mm\u2009Hg, respectively, P<0.001 vs. baseline). Imidapril increased glucose infusion rate (+1.1\u2009mg\u2009min(-1) per kg, P<0.02), whereas candesartan did not change it. Both drugs decreased PAI-1 antigen activity after 4 weeks of treatment; subsequently, only the decreasing effect of imidapril was sustained throughout the 12 weeks, whereas candesartan increased PAI-1 activity at week 12 (P<0.05 vs. baseline, P<0.01 vs. imidapril). Activity of t-PA decreased with candesartan (from 0.48\u00b10.16 to 0.43\u00b10.14\u2009IU\u2009ml(-1), P<0.05) but not with imidapril. Activity of t-PA in response to desmopressin was increased more by imidapril (+4.45\u2009IU\u2009ml(-1)) than by candesartan (+2.73\u2009IU\u2009ml(-1), P<0.01 vs. imidapril). These results indicate that in normoweight hypertensive patients, despite similar BP reduction, imidapril but not candesartan improved the fibrinolytic balance, suggesting that mechanisms other than Ang II inhibition, possibly including bradykinin-mediated effects on insulin sensitivity and endothelial function, may be responsible for these different effects.",

After 18 months of treatment, he developed kidney injury and the treatment was discontinued. At 9 months and before the development of kidney injury, LY2181308 concentrations were 8- to 10-fold higher relative to median predicted values, but within the targeted exposure considered to be safe. However, at 17 months, 28 days after stopping LY2181308 therapy, LY2181308 concentration exceeded the predicted range by 38-fold. His decreased kidney function was slow to improve after stopping treatment. A kidney biopsy showed signs of acute tubular injury with regeneration. Complete recovery of kidney function occurred 6 months after treatment was stopped. The relationship between high exposures and slow LY2181308 clearance with the gradual improvement in kidney function after stopping the antisense treatment suggests that the oligonucleotide was related to the kidney injury. Based on this case report, kidney function should be monitored frequently in patients receiving long-term treatment with antisense oligonucleotides that specifically target survivin, particularly when they receive concomitant angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.",

    "777": "It is known that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) can be used to mitigate radiation-induced renal injury. However, for a variety of reasons, these previous results are not directly applicable to the development of agents for the mitigation of injuries caused by terrorism-related radiation exposure. As part of an effort to develop an animal model that would fit the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \"Animal Efficacy Rule\", we designed new studies which used an FDA-approved ACEI (captopril) or an FDA-approved ARB (losartan, Cozaar\u00ae) started 10 days after a single total-body irradiation (TBI) at drug doses that are equivalent (on a g/m(2)/day basis) to the doses prescribed to humans. Captopril and losartan were equally effective as mitigators, with DMFs of 1.23 and 1.21, respectively, for delaying renal failure. These studies show that radiation nephropathy in a realistic rodent model can be mitigated with relevant doses of FDA-approved agents. This lays the necessary groundwork for pivotal rodent studies under the FDA Animal Efficacy Rule and provides an outline of how the FDA-required large-animal studies could be designed.", 
    "778": "Lyophylized antler powder was hydrolyzed by pepsin and trypsin separately and also simultaneously to give hydrolysates with special physical activities. Complete hydrolysis peptides with MW lower than 1 x 10(3) were collected for assay of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, antioxidant activity and proliferative activity toward UMR-106 osteoblast cells. The results of the experiments revealed that all hydrolysates exhibited potent hydroxyl radical scavenging activity with an IC50 value less than 1 mg/ml which was much lower than the value of 5.5 g x L(-1) for vitamin C. The peptic and peptic tryptic hydrolysates demonstrated strong angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity. The tryptic hydrolysate increased the proliferation of the UMR-106 cells by 73.43%. The results verified the traditional use of antler in bone-strengthening, anti-aging. The exploratory studies on the ACE inhibitory activity of antler hydrolysates indicated that the hydrolysates might be potentially useful in prevention and treatment of hypertension.

    "779": "In this project we report on the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity of a bovine gelatin hydrolysate (Bh2) that was submitted to further hydrolysis by different enzymes. The thermolysin hydrolysate (Bh2t) showed the highest in vitro ACE inhibitory activity, and interestingly a marked in vivo blood pressure-lowering effect was demonstrated in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In contrast, Bh2 showed no effect in SHR, confirming the need for the extra thermolysin hydrolysis. Hence, an angiotensin I-evoked contractile response in isolated rat aortic rings was inhibited by Bh2t, but not by Bh2, suggesting ACE inhibition as the underlying antihypertensive mechanism for Bh2t. Using mass spectrometry, seven small peptides, AG, AGP, VGP, PY, QY, DY and IY or LY or HO-PY were identified in Bh2t. As these peptides showed ACE inhibitory activity and were more prominent in Bh2t than in Bh2, the current data provide evidence that these contribute to the antihypertensive effect of Bh2t.",

    "783": "The renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) regulates blood pressure mainly via the actions of angiotensin (Ang)II, generated via angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). The ACE homologue ACE2 metabolises AngII to Ang1-7, decreasing AngII and increasing Ang1-7, which counteracts AngII activity via the Mas receptor. However, ACE2 also converts AngI to Ang1-9, a poorly characterised peptide which can be further converted to Ang1-7 via ACE. Ang1-9 stimulates bradykinin release in endothelium and has antihypertrophic actions in the heart, attributed to its being a competitive inhibitor of ACE, leading to decreased AngII, rather than increased Ang1-7. To date no direct receptor-mediated effects of Ang1-9 have been described. To further understand the role of Ang1-9 in RAS function we assessed its action in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in rat neonatal H9c2 and primary adult rabbit left ventricular cardiomyocytes, compared to Ang1-7. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was stimulated with AngII or vasopressin, significantly increasing cell size by approximately 1.2-fold (P < 0.05) as well as stimulating expression of the hypertrophy gene markers atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, \u03b2-myosin heavy chain and myosin light chain (2- to 5-fold, P < 0.05). Both Ang1-9 and Ang1-7 were able to block hypertrophy induced by either agonist (control, 186.4 \u03bcm; AngII, 232.8 \u03bcm; AngII+Ang1-7, 198.3 \u03bcm; AngII+Ang1-9, 195.9 \u03bcm; P < 0.05). The effects of Ang1-9 were not inhibited by captopril, supporting previous evidence that Ang1-9 acts independently of Ang1-7. Next, we investigated receptor signalling via angiotensin type 1 and type 2 receptors (AT1R, AT2R) and Mas. The AT1R antagonist losartan blocked AngII-induced, but not vasopressin-induced, hypertrophy. Losartan did not block the antihypertrophic effects of Ang1-9, or Ang1-7 on vasopressin-stimulated cardiomyocytes. The Mas antagonist A779 efficiently blocked the antihypertrophic effects of Ang1-7, without affecting Ang1-9. Furthermore, Ang1-7 activity was also inhibited in the presence of the bradykinin type 2 receptor antagonist HOE140, without affecting Ang1-9. Moreover, we observed that the AT2R antagonist PD123,319 abolished the antihypertrophic effects of Ang1-9, without affecting Ang1-7, suggesting Ang1-9 signals via the AT2R. Radioligand binding assays demonstrated that Ang1-9 was able to bind the AT2R (pKi = 6.28 \u00b1 0.1). In summary, we ascribe a direct biological role for Ang1-9 acting via the AT2R. This has implications for RAS function and identifying new therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "784": "The rising incidence of obesity has led to increased prevalence of a distinct, obesity-related metabolic syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by truncal obesity, insulin resistance, altered lipid levels, and hypertension. Definition of the metabolic syndrome rests on a set of clinical criteria instead of a single diagnostic test. It carries a different risk profile than obesity alone, and poses special challenges for the anaesthesiologist. These include preoperative risk stratification for common comorbidities, identifying reasonable thresholds for implementing preoperative risk reduction, overcoming obesity-related issues in intraoperative management, and delivering safe postoperative care. The metabolic syndrome predisposes to coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnoea, pulmonary dysfunction, and deep venous thrombosis. Because its different presentations can have different risk profiles, anaesthesiologists should assess the cumulative risk of each component of the metabolic syndrome separately, which significantly complicates preoperative management. Since obesity itself is difficult to treat, preoperative risk reduction can be difficult. Few data exist to inform best practice as to the anaesthetic care of patients with metabolic syndrome. This review evaluates and synthesizes current evidence regarding perioperative care for patients with the metabolic syndrome, including indications for preoperative testing; use of aspirin, \u03b2-blockers, statins, heparin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; anaesthetic strategies including regional anaesthesia; and postoperative management including continuous positive pressure ventilation by mask, prevention of pulmonary embolism, and indications for advanced respiratory monitoring.", 
    "785": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) represents a key therapeutic target in heart failure (HF) management. However, conventional agents that block this system induce a reflex increase in plasma renin activity (PRA), which may lead to RAAS 'escape'. Direct renin inhibitors (DRIs) have been developed that decrease PRA and thus may provide a greater RAAS blockade. Aliskiren is the first orally active DRI. Plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) have been observed to be reduced with aliskiren compared with placebo. The aim of the Aliskiren Trial of Minimizing OutcomeS for Patients with HEart failuRE (ATMOSPHERE) study is to evaluate the effect of both aliskiren and enalapril monotherapy and aliskiren/enalapril combination therapy on cardiovascular death and HF hospitalization in patients with chronic systolic HF, NYHA functional class II-IV symptoms, and elevated plasma levels of BNP. Methods Patients tolerant to at least 10 mg or equivalent of enalapril will undergo an open-label run-in period where they receive enalapril then aliskiren. Approximately 7000 patients tolerating this run-in period will then be randomized 1:1:1 to aliskiren monotherapy, enalapril monotherapy, or the combination. The primary endpoints of ATMOSPHERE are (i) whether the aliskiren/enalapril combination is superior to enalapril monotherapy in delaying time to first occurrence of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and (ii) whether aliskiren monotherapy is superior or at least non-inferior to enalapril monotherapy on this endpoint. Perspective The ATMOSPHERE study will definitively determine the role of a DRI strategy additional to or as an alternative to conventional RAAS blockade in patients with chronic systolic HF.", 
    "786": "The present study describes the development of a novel analytical approach that can reduce by 50-fold the consumption of organic solvents in the charge transfer (CT)-based spectrophotometric analysis. The proposed approach employed 96-microwell assay plates for carrying out the reaction. The CT reaction between the electron-donating analyte and electron-accepting reagent was performed in microwells (200-\u03bcL of organic solvent) and the color signals were measured with a microwell-plate reader. Optimum conditions for the proposed approach were established for two antihypertensive drugs, namely ramipril (RML) and lisinopril (LSL) as model compounds for the electron-donating analytes, and 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) as a \u03c0-electron acceptor. Under the optimum conditions, Beer's law was obeyed in the concentration range of 6-100 and 6-60 \u03bcg mL-1 for RML and LSL, respectively. The limits of detection were 0.97 and 1.10 \u03bcg mL-1 for RML and LSL, respectively. The precision of the methods was satisfactory; the values of relative standard deviations did not exceed 1.1 %. The proposed approach was successfully applied to the analysis of pharmaceutical dosage forms with good accuracy and precision. The results were comparable with those of the reported methods. The approach described herein is of great practical value in pharmaceutical analysis because it reduces the exposure of analysts to the toxic effects of organic solvents, lowers the analysis cost by 50-fold, and it has a high throughput property. Although the approach was validated for RML and LSL, the same methodology could be used for any electron-donating analyte for which a CT-reaction can be performed.", 
    "787": "During 8 sampling campaigns carried out over a period of two years, 72 samples, including influent and effluent wastewater, and sludge samples from three conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), were analyzed to assess the occurrence and fate of 43 pharmaceutical compounds. The selected pharmaceuticals belong to different therapeutic classes, i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, lipid modifying agents (fibrates and statins), psychiatric drugs (benzodiazepine derivative drugs and antiepileptics), histamine H2-receptor antagonists, antibacterials for systemic use, beta blocking agents, beta-agonists, diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and anti-diabetics. The obtained results showed the presence of 32 target compounds in wastewater influent and 29 in effluent, in concentrations ranging from low ng/L to a few \u03bcg/L (e.g. NSAIDs). The analysis of sludge samples showed that 21 pharmaceuticals accumulated in sewage sludge from all three WWTPs in concentrations up to 100 ng/g. This indicates that even good removal rates obtained in aqueous phase (i.e. comparison of influent and effluent wastewater concentrations) do not imply degradation to the same extent. For this reason, the overall removal was estimated as a sum of all the losses of a parent compound produces by different mechanisms of chemical and physical transformation, biodegradation and sorption to solid matter. The target compounds showed very different removal rates and no logical pattern in behaviour even if they belong to the same therapeutic groups. What is clear is that the elimination of most of the substances is incomplete and improvements of the wastewater treatment and subsequent treatments of the produced sludge are required to prevent the introduction of these micro-pollutants in the environment.",

Clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Cardiology Foundation-American Heart Association, Heart Failure Society of America, and European Society of Cardiology offer recommendations for the management of AHFS, addressing the role of diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropes. The guidelines emphasize the utility of vasodilators for patients with signs and symptoms of pulmonary congestion, including pulmonary edema or severe hypertension or both, who have not responded to diuretics. The early initiation of vasoactive medications, including diuretics and vasodilators, has been linked to improved outcomes in some reports. Conversely, the use of inotropes is de-emphasized, particularly as part of the routine management of these patients. Newer agents, including vasopressin antagonists, have also been approved recently but are not addressed by the clinical practice guidelines. The guidelines address the importance of initiating and optimizing evidence-based oral medications for long-term use, including angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists, during the patient's hospital stay in an effort to address long-term outcomes.",

As many renal transplant recipients show chronic changes on biopsy within the first year, early RAS blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) could be beneficial. However, it remains unclear that early ACEI use is safe. We conducted a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety of enalapril 5 mg during the early post-transplant period. Subjects took the study medication for six months. Primary endpoints were serum potassium (K) >5.9 mEq/L and 30% increase in baseline creatinine. A total of 53 subjects were randomized, and of them, 27 received the study drug. Twenty-nine subjects, 14 ACEI and 15 controls, completed the six-month protocol without reaching an endpoint. Patients on ACEI had higher K and higher BUN at six months. Serum creatinine, hematocrit, and urinary protein were not different. There was no difference in urinary TGF-\u03b21. Twenty-four subjects reached study endpoints. When the common clinical endpoints of elevated creatinine and hyperkalemia were combined, ACEI group had significantly increased endpoints vs. control (10/13, 77% vs. 5/11, 45%, p < 0.05). We conclude that ACEI use in the early post-transplant period can be safe but patients must be carefully selected and monitored for elevations in serum creatinine and potassium.

Overall, enalapril treatment consistently attenuated age-related increases in adiposity relative to both placebo and losartan. The maximal effect was achieved after 3 months of treatment (between 24 and 27 months of age), at a dose of 40 mg/kg and was observed in the absence of any changes in physical activity, body temperature, or food intake. In addition, the reduction in fat mass was not due to changes in pathology given that enalapril attenuated age-related increases in tumor development relative to placebo- and losartan-treated animals. Both enalapril and losartan attenuated age-related decreases in grip strength, suggesting that changes in body composition appear dissociated from improvements in physical function and may reflect a differential impact of enalapril and losartan on muscle quality. To link changes in adiposity to improvements in skeletal muscle quality, we performed gene array analyses to generate hypotheses regarding cell signaling pathways altered with enalapril treatment. Based on these results, our primary follow-up pathway was mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of myocytes. Relative to losartan- and placebo-treated rats, only enalapril decreased DNA fragmentation and caspase-dependent apoptotic signaling. These data suggest that attenuation of the severity of skeletal muscle apoptosis promoted by enalapril may represent a distinct mechanism through which this compound improves muscle strength/quality.",

Among such patients, the 377 patients with ACS were evaluated (37.9% of whom were females), and the mean age was 62.2 \u00b1 11.6 years. The presence of HF before or during hospitalization influenced mortality. Among the prognostic factors, emphasis should be placed on the initial creatinine level, with the cutoff point being set at 1.4 mg/dl (accuracy = 62.1%, HR = 3.27; p < 0.001). We noted a worse prognosis for each additional ten years of age (HR = 1.37, p < 0.001) and for each increment of 10 bpm heart rate (HR = 1.22 p < 0.001). As for the therapies used before and after 2002, there was an increase of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), statins and antiplatelet agents, having an impact on mortality.",

Antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system have been shown to be effective for controlling blood pressure in adult and elderly patients. Importantly, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors were shown to have benefits beyond their classic cardioprotective and vasculoprotective effects, including reducing the risk of new-onset diabetes and associated cardiovascular effects. The discovery that the renin-angiotensin system inhibitor and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blocker (ARB), telmisartan, can selectively activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3, an established antidiabetic drug target) provides the unique opportunity to prevent and treat cardiovascular complications in high-risk elderly patients with hypertension and new-onset diabetes. Two large clinical trials, ONTARGET (Ongoing Telmisartan Alone in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial) and TRANSCEND (Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in ACE-I iNtolerant subjects with cardiovascular disease) have assessed the cardioprotective and antidiabetic effects of telmisartan. The collective data suggest that telmisartan is a promising drug for controlling hypertension and reducing vascular risk in high-risk elderly patients with new-onset diabetes.",

The goal of our studies was to identify additional agents that overcome the anti-myogenic effect of TGF-\u03b21.", 
    "859": "A high-content cell-based assay was developed in a 96-well plate format that detects the expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) in C2C12 cells. The assay was used to quantify the dose-dependent responses of C2C12 cell differentiation to TGF-\u03b21 and to the TGF-\u03b21 Type 1 receptor kinase inhibitor, SB431542. Thirteen agents previously described as promoting C2C12 differentiation in the absence of TGF-\u03b21 were screened in the presence of TGF-\u03b21. Only all-trans retinoic acid and 9-cis retinoic acid allowed a maximal level of C2C12 cell differentiation in the presence of TGF-\u03b21; the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and 10 nM estrogen provided partial rescue. Vitamin D was a potent inhibitor of retinoic acid-induced myogenesis in the presence of TGF-\u03b21. TGF-\u03b21 inhibits myoblast differentiation through activation of Smad3; however, retinoic acid did not inhibit TGF-\u03b21-induced activation of a Smad3-dependent reporter gene in C2C12 cells.",

With regard to the goal of improving muscle regeneration and function in individuals with muscle disease, the identification of retinoic acid is intriguing in that some retinoids are already approved for human therapy. However, retinoids also have well-described adverse effects.

Recent studies have shown that it accounts for 1%-2% of cases of ST-elevation infarction. An episode of intense emotional or physiologic stress has been reported before its presentation and is presumed to be the triggering factor in the pathogenesis. The pathophysiology of this syndrome still remains unclear, and management is mostly empiric and supportive. In this review, we have discussed various pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this cardiomyopathy and their pharmacological implications and role of medications such as aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins for patients presenting with this syndrome in treatment and prevention.",

Because associated adverse effects (ACEIs) may result in life-threatening angioedema, we sought to assess patients' level of awareness of ACEI AEs, determine if patients have an appropriate action plan in the event of an ACEI AE, determine if a brief educational intervention in the emergency department (ED) could improve knowledge about ACEI AEs. This was a prospective in-person survey conducted between August and December 2008 in a large urban academic ED. The survey instrument was used to collect data on demographics, recognition of ACEI AEs, and action plans. A follow-up survey to assess recall of AEs was done 7 days after ED discharge. Of 208 eligible patients, 113 enrolled: sixty-five (58%) were females, median age was 55 years [interquartile range (IQR) 47-64]. The majority of participants (69%) had a high-school diploma or less. On a 5-point Likert scale (5 = \"very important\"), the median reported level of overall concern for ACEI AEs was 5 (IQR 4-5). Twenty-seven (25%) of the participants reported being told that ACEIs have potential AEs at the time of the initial prescription. Correct identification of potential ACEI-associated AEs in the ED was variable with a median of 8 of 16 correctly answered questions (IQR 6-10). At follow-up, the median score was 9 (IQR 6-10). There was no association between educational level and number of correct AE responses (P = 0.10). Despite a high level of expressed concern regarding ACEI AEs, patients' knowledge of AEs was poor, and recall was minimally improved at follow-up. Most patients have a plan in the event of an AE.", 
    "863": "Heart failure is a common cardiovascular disease with high morbidity and mortality. Unlike western countries where heart failure is predominantly a disease of the elderly, in India it affects younger age group. Important risk factors include coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, valvular heart disease and cardiomyopathies. Plasma brain natriuretic peptide levels are helpful in the diagnosis of heart failure. Echocardiography is the primary imaging modality of choice, through recently cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been found to play an increasing role. Aim of management is to improve symptoms & enhance survival. Diuretics are important in relieving symptoms. Beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and adosterone antagonists improve survival in patients with impaired systolic function. Device therapy including cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardiac defibrillators, though expensive are useful in selected patients. Unlike in patients with systolic heart failure where several therapies have been shown to improve survival, clinical trial results in diastolic heart failure have been disappointing and therapy in these patients is restricted to symptom improvement and risk factor control. Therapies like stem cell therapy are being evaluated in clinical trials and appear promising. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy helps in reversing the process of remodelling and clinical improvement in most of the patients.", 
    "864": "High blood pressure (BP) is a major public health problem in India and its prevalence is rapidly increasing among urban and rural populations. Reducing systolic and diastolic BP can decrease cardiovascular risk and this can be achieved by non-pharmacological (lifestyle measures) as well as pharmacological means. Lifestyle changes should be the initial approach to hypertension management and include dietary interventions (reducing salt, increasing potassium, alcohol avoidance, and multifactorial diet control), weight reduction, tobacco cessation, physical exercise, and stress management. A number of pharmaceutical agents, well evidenced by large randomized clinical trials, are available for initial treatment of high BP. These include older molecules such as thiazide diuretics and beta-blocking agents and newer molecules, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). In view of the recent clinical trials data, some international guidelines suggest that CCB, ACE inhibitors or ARB and not beta-blockers or diuretics should be the initial therapy in hypertension management. Comprehensive hypertension management focuses on reducing overall cardiovascular risk by lifestyle measures, BP lowering and lipid management and should be the preferred initial treatment approach.", 
    "865": "Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.", 
    "866": "Our previous studies have indicated that chronic treatment with 1-[(2-dimethylamino) ethylamino]-4-(hydroxymethyl)-7-[(4-methylphenyl) sulfonyl oxy]-9H-xanthene-9-one (XNT), an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activator, reverses hypertension-induced cardiac and renal fibrosis in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Furthermore, XNT prevented pulmonary vascular remodelling and right ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in a rat model of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of XNT against cardiac fibrosis. Hydroxyproline assay was used to measure cardiac collagen content in control and XNT-treated (200 ng kg(-1) min(-1) for 28 days) SHRs. Cardiac ACE2 activity and protein levels were determined using the fluorogenic peptide assay and Western blot analysis, respectively. Extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs; p44 and p42) and angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor levels were quantified by Western blotting. Cardiac ACE2 protein levels were \u223c15% lower in SHRs compared with Wistar-Kyoto control animals (ACE2/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ratio: Wistar-Kyoto, 1.00 \u00b1 0.02 versus SHR, 0.87 \u00b1 0.01). However, treatment of SHRs with XNT completely restored the decreased cardiac ACE2 levels. Also, chronic infusion of XNT significantly increased cardiac ACE2 activity in SHRs. This increase in ACE2 activity was associated with decreased cardiac collagen content. Furthermore, the antifibrotic effect of XNT correlated with increased cardiac angiotensin-(1-7) immunostaining, though no change in cardiac AT(1) protein levels was observed. The beneficial effects of XNT were also accompanied by a reduction in ERK phosphorylation (phospho-ERK/total ERK ratio: Wistar-Kyoto, 1.00 \u00b1 0.04; control SHR, 1.46 \u00b1 0.25; treated SHR, 0.86 \u00b1 0.02). Our observations demonstrate that XNT activates cardiac ACE2 and inhibits fibrosis. These effects are associated with increases in angiotensin-(1-7) and inhibition of cardiac ERK signalling.", 
    "867": "Tarka\u00ae is a combination antihypertensive medication composed of verapamil hydrochloride and trandolapril. A 3.5-year-old female was brought to our hospital due to a sleepy condition 7 hours after an accidental ingestion of six tablets of Tarka\u00ae containing 240 mg verapamil hydrochloride and 4 mg trandolapril in each tablet. Five hours after hospitalization, her condition deteriorated and arterial pressure progressively decreased despite the treatment. Finally, a temporary pacemaker was implanted, after which the vital findings began to return to normal values. The pacemaker was removed 13 hours after implantation as normal heart rhythm was observed. There are no reports of intoxication with fixed-dose combination products, especially Tarka\u00ae, in young children in the literature. Therefore, we believe that our report can provide an insight on the toxic dose of this drug in younger children. Clinicians should keep in mind that lethargy can be the first symptom of a possible clinical deterioration, even in normotensive and normorhythmic individuals.", 
    "868": "Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) induces anemia in humans and mice, but it is unclear whether ACE is involved in other aspects of hematopoiesis. Here, we systemically evaluated ACE-knockout (KO) mice and found myelopoietic abnormalities characterized by increased bone marrow myeloblasts and myelocytes, as well as extramedullary myelopoiesis. Peritoneal macrophages from ACE-KO mice were deficient in the production of effector molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-12p40, and CD86 when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-\u03b3. ACE-KO mice were more susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus infection. Further studies using total or fractionated bone marrows revealed that ACE regulates myeloid proliferation, differentiation, and functional maturation via angiotensin II and substance P and through the angiotensin II receptor type 1 and substance P neurokinin 1 receptors. Angiotensin II was correlated with CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein-\u03b1 up-regulation during myelopoiesis. Angiotensin II supplementation of ACE-KO mice rescued macrophage functional maturation. These results demonstrate a previous unrecognized significant role for ACE in myelopoiesis and imply new perspectives for manipulating myeloid cell expansion and maturation.",

    "870": "An accurate, sensitive and specific high performance liquid chromatography-electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD) method that was developed and validated for captopril (CPT) is presented. Separation was achieved using a Phenomenex(\u00ae) Luna 5 \u03bcm (C(18)) column and a mobile phase comprised of phosphate buffer (adjusted to pH 3.0): acetonitrile in a ratio of 70:30 (v/v). Detection was accomplished using a full scan multi channel ESA Coulometric detector in the \"oxidative-screen\" mode with the upstream electrode (E(1)) set at +600 mV and the downstream (analytical) electrode (E(2)) set at +950 mV, while the potential of the guard cell was maintained at +1050 mV. The detector gain was set at 300. Experimental design using central composite design (CCD) was used to facilitate method development. Mobile phase pH, molarity and concentration of acetonitrile (ACN) were considered the critical factors to be studied to establish the retention time of CPT and cyclizine (CYC) that was used as the internal standard. Twenty experiments including centre points were undertaken and a quadratic model was derived for the retention time for CPT using the experimental data. The method was validated for linearity, accuracy, precision, limits of quantitation and detection, as per the ICH guidelines. The system was found to produce sharp and well-resolved peaks for CPT and CYC with retention times of 3.08 and 7.56 min, respectively. Linear regression analysis for the calibration curve showed a good linear relationship with a regression coefficient of 0.978 in the concentration range of 2-70 \u03bcg/mL. The linear regression equation was y=0.0131x+0.0275. The limits of detection (LOQ) and quantitation (LOD) were found to be 2.27 and 0.6 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The method was used to analyze CPT in tablets. The wide range for linearity, accuracy, sensitivity, short retention time and composition of the mobile phase indicated that this method is better for the quantification of CPT than the pharmacopoeial methods.",

They were selected from the list of top-sold prescription pharmaceuticals in Belgium. The chromatographic separation was optimized in order to achieve suitable retention times, good resolution for analytes susceptible of mass spectrometric cross-talk and high sensitivity in one single run. All compounds eluted within 9 min on a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column, based on a newly developed technology that allows a very narrow distribution of the core-shell particles, providing high separation efficiency. Sample preparation was executed with solid-phase extraction on Oasis MCX cartridges. The method was validated by assessing specificity, selectivity, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), linearity, accuracy, precision, extraction recovery, and matrix effects following Food and Drug Administration guidelines. The method LLOQs ranged from 0.5 to 25 ng/L. Calibration curves and LLOQs were designed to provide a good analytical performance at concentrations expected in real influent wastewater samples for each target compound. Eight deuterated analogues were used as internal standards for quantification. The method was applied to influent wastewater samples collected from 17 different wastewater treatment plants throughout Belgium. Most of the analytes were measured in the samples at concentrations above LLOQ. Seven of the compounds were for the first time reported in influent wastewater.

    "873": "Fibroblasts play a pivotal role in cardiac remodeling and the development of heart failure through the deposition of extra-cellular matrix (ECM) proteins and also by affecting cardiomyocyte growth and function. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is a key regulator of the cardiovascular system in health and disease and many of its effects involve cardiac fibroblasts. Levels of angiotensin II (Ang II), the main effector molecule of the RAS, are elevated in the failing heart and there is a substantial body of evidence indicating that this peptide contributes to changes in cardiac structure and function which ultimately lead to progressive worsening in heart failure. A pathway involving angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has the capacity to break down Ang II while generating angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)), a heptapeptide, which in contrast to Ang II, has cardioprotective and anti-remodeling effects. Many Ang-(1-7) actions involve cardiac fibroblasts and there is information indicating that it reduces collagen production and also may protect against cardiac hypertrophy. This report describes the effects of ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) that appear to be relevant in cardiac remodeling and heart failure and explores potential therapeutic strategies designed to increase ACE2 activity and Ang-(1-7) levels to treat these conditions.

We sought to determine the clinical profile and predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with AHF and PLVEF in the Acute Heart Failure Global Survey of Standard Treatment (ALARM-HF). This survey is an international observational study of 4,953 patients admitted for AHF in 9 countries (6 European countries, Mexico, and Australia) from October 2006 to March 2007. Patients with PLVEF were defined by an LVEF \u2265 45%. Of the total cohort, 25% of patients had PLVEF. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower in this subgroup (7% vs 11% in patients with decreased LVEF, p = 0.013). Candidate variables included demographics, baseline clinical findings, and treatment. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the variables independently associated with in-hospital mortality included systolic blood pressure at admission (p <0.001), serum sodium (p = 0.041), positive troponin result (p = 0.023), serum creatinine >2 mg/dl (p = 0.042), history of peripheral vascular disease and anemia (p = 0.004 and p = 0.015, respectively), secondary (hospitalization for other reason) versus primary AHF diagnosis (p = 0.043), and previous treatment with diuretics (p = 0.023) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (p = 0.021). In conclusion, patients with AHF and PLVEF have lower in-hospital mortality than those with decreased LVEF. Low systolic blood pressure, low serum sodium, renal dysfunction, positive markers of myocardial injury, presence of co-morbidities such as peripheral vascular disease and anemia, secondary versus primary AHF diagnosis, and absence of treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at admission may identify high-risk patients with AHF and PLVEF.",

HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 were activated preceding reticulocyte and red blood cell recovery. TBI, which ablates early and late-stage erythroid progenitors, activated both HIFs and increased EPO and TPO. Captopril treatment postirradiation suppressed radiation-induced HIF activation and EPO expression.

After discharge, patients were randomized to either clinically-guided outpatient management (n = 171), or management guided by an individually set NT-proBNP (n = 174) defined by the lowest level at discharge or 2 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was defined as number of days alive outside the hospital after index admission.", 
    "895": "HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target increased the use of HF medication (p = 0.006), and 64% of HF-related events were preceded by an increase in NT-proBNP. Nevertheless, HF management guided by this individualized NT-proBNP target did not significantly improve the primary end point (685 vs. 664 days, p = 0.49), nor did it significantly improve any of the secondary end points. In the NT-proBNP-guided group mortality was lower, as 46 patients died (26.5%) versus 57 (33.3%) in the clinically-guided group, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.206).", 
    "896": "Serial NT-proBNP measurement and targeting to an individual NT-proBNP value did result in advanced detection of HF-related events and importantly influenced HF-therapy, but failed to provide significant clinical improvement in terms of mortality and morbidity.

    "897": "Important biological processes require selective and orderly protein-protein interactions at every level of the signalling cascades. G proteins are a family of heterotrimeric GTPases that effect eukaryotic signal transduction through the coupling of cell surface receptors to cytoplasmic effector proteins. They have been associated with growth and pathogenicity in many fungi through gene knock-out studies. In Sporothrix schenckii, a pathogenic, dimorphic fungus, we previously identified a pertussis sensitive G alpha subunit, SSG-1. In this work we inquire into its interactions with other proteins.", 
    "898": "Using the yeast two-hybrid technique, we identified protein-protein interactions between SSG-1 and other important cellular proteins. The interactions were corroborated using co-immuneprecipitation. Using these techniques we identified a Fe/Mn superoxide dismutase (SOD), a glyceraldehyde-3-P dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and two ion transport proteins, a siderophore-iron transporter belonging to the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and a divalent-cation transporter of the Nramp (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein) family as interacting with SSG-1. The cDNA's encoding these proteins were sequenced and bioinformatic macromolecular sequence analyses were used for the correct classification and functional assignment.", 
    "899": "This study constitutes the first report of the interaction of a fungal G alpha inhibitory subunit with SOD, GAPDH, and two metal ion transporters. The identification of such important proteins as partners of a G alpha subunit in this fungus suggests possible mechanisms through which this G protein can affect pathogenicity and survival under conditions of environmental stress or inside the human host. The two ion transporters identified in this work are the first to be reported in S. schenckii and the first time they are identified as interacting with fungal G protein alpha subunits. The association of G protein alpha subunits to transport molecules reinforces the role of G proteins in the response to environmental signals and also highlights the involvement of fungal G protein alpha subunits in nutrient sensing in S. schenckii. These interactions suggest that these permeases could function as transceptors for G proteins in fungi.", 
    "900": "One of the critical points in the pathogenesis of aortic aneurysms (AAs) is the disruption of the balance between vascular extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and degradation. AAs are common features in some genetically determined diseases of the connective tissue, such as Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos. Acquired factors determining an enhanced inflammatory state of the arterial wall also play a key role. Previous studies have determined the role of tumor growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2); as a principal mediator of the pathogenesis of the alterations of the arterial wall homeostasis in AAs. The medical management of any AA is mainly focused on the use of pharmacological agents that reduce hemodynamic stress of the aortic wall, since hypertension is the major risk factor for the enlargement and rupture of the AAs. However, this is far from being a comprehensive pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach. Drugs potentially able to reduce the release of TGF-\u03b2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the AAs. They work by improving matrix repair, decreasing the proteolytic pattern and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) as well as preventing angiotensin II-induced angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) activation. A new pathophysiology-based therapeutic approach, involving the mechanisms leading to the rupture of the AAs, could represent an additional tool in combination with the current established antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "901": "Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) as a class are generally considered safe and better tolerated than other antihypertensive drugs. The purpose of this report is to review the main data on the safety and tolerability of the second generation ARB valsartan after > 10 years since its initial approval.", 
    "902": "We searched Medline for clinical studies published between 1997 and 2010 that involve valsartan and focus on its safety and tolerability profile. The main large-scale studies in hypertension, heart failure, post-myocardial infarction (MI) and chronic kidney disease are reviewed.", 
    "903": "Valsartan demonstrates to be safe and well tolerated both in monotherapy and in combination therapy of hypertension in a broad range of patients, including the elderly, children, diabetics, obese patients and patients at high cardiovascular risk. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) are malaise/fatigue, dizziness, headache and nausea/vomiting, whose incidence, however, is similar to that observed with placebo. Cough, a common class effect of ACE inhibitors, occurs less frequently with valsartan. When combined with hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan counteracts the adverse metabolic effects of the diuretic, whereas it reduces ankle edema formation when combined with amlodipine. In diabetic hypertensives, valsartan does not adversely affect glucose and lipid metabolism and even improves it. In post-MI patients, the rate of discontinuation due to AE, mainly hypotension, cough and increased serum creatinine, is lower in valsartan than in ACE inhibitor treated patients. Valsartan is also safe and well tolerated in patients with nephropathy although serum potassium levels need to be monitored more closely.",

The ACEI components included benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, moexipril, perindopril, quinapril, ramipril, and trandolapril. Outcomes measured during the 6-month study period included the proportion of days covered (PDC), treatment discontinuation, healthcare resource utilization, and changes in healthcare costs (study period minus 6-month baseline values). Risk-adjusted differences in outcomes between treatments and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multivariate regression models, controlling for demographics, region, co-morbidities, prescription drug use, and resource utilization during the baseline period.",

    "910": "Two simple and accurate methods to determine atorvastatin calcium and ramipril in capsule dosage forms were developed and validated using HPLC and HPTLC. The HPLC separation was achieved on a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (250 x 4.6 mm id, 5 microm) in the isocratic mode using 0.1% phosphoric acid-acetonitrile (38 + 62, v/v), pH 3.5 +/- 0.05, mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The retention times were 6.42 and 2.86 min for atorvastatin calcium and ramipril, respectively. Quantification was achieved with a photodiode array detector set at 210 nm over the concentration range of 0.5-5 microg/mL for each, with mean recoveries (at three concentration levels) of 100.06 +/- 0.49% and 99.95 +/- 0.63% RSD for atorvastatin calcium and ramipril, respectively. The HPTLC separation was achieved on silica gel 60 F254 HPTLC plates using methanol-benzene-glacial acetic acid (19.6 + 80.0 + 0.4, v/v/v) as the mobile phase. The Rf values were 0.40 and 0.20 for atorvastatin calcium and ramipril, respectively. Quantification was achieved with UV densitometry at 210 nm over the concentration range of 50-500 ng/spot for each, with mean recoveries (at three concentration levels) of 99.98 +/- 0.75% and 99.87 +/- 0.83% RSD for atorvastatin calcium and ramipril, respectively. Both methods were validated according to International Conference on Harmonization guidelines and found to be simple, specific, accurate, precise, and robust. The mean assay percentages for atorvastatin calcium and ramipril were 99.90 and 99.55% for HPLC and 99.91 and 99.47% for HPTLC, respectively.

QT duration and dispersion have been reported to be longer in patients with CSF. ACE inhibitors may improve CSF through positive effects on endothelial function. The study included 32 patients having CSF and 25 subjects having normal coronary arteries in coronary angiography. The patients were evaluated with 12-leads electrocardiography and echocardiography before and 3 months after treatment with perindopril. Compared to the control group, maximum corrected QT duration (QTcmax) (432.0 \u00b1 28.9 vs. 407.0 \u00b1 39.1 ms, p = 0.008) and QT dispersion (QTcD) (64.0 \u00b1 16.5 vs. 37.3 \u00b1 12.1 ms, p < 0.001), mitral inflow deceleration time (DT) (251.3 \u00b1 49.4 vs. 218.8 \u00b1 44.5 ms, p = 0.013), and isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT) (115.8 \u00b1 18.4 vs. 107.2 \u00b1 22.9 ms, p < 0.001) were significantly longer and E/A ratio 0.85 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.1 \u00b1 0.3, p = 0.004) was lower in patients with CSF.

Coronary slow may be associated with prolonged QT interval and increased QT dispersion and impaired diastolic filling. Perindopril may be helpful in restoration of these findings.", 
    "912": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) contributes to elevated cardiac mortality with graft function in renal transplant recipients. Antihypertensive therapy, and especially angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, proved to be effective in regressing the LVH of renal transplant recipients, at least in part by interacting with immunosuppressive agents, thus raising the possibility that immunosuppressive therapy might affect changes in the left ventricular mass (LVM) of recipients. This review mainly focuses on the potential role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition to regress cardiac hypertrophy in both experimental models and in the clinical setting. We comment on the results of experimental studies conducted on animal models, which showed regression of cardiac hypertrophy by sirolimus (SRL). We also discuss clinical studies that show that conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to SRL is effective to achieve regression of LVH in both kidney and cardiac transplant recipients, mainly by reducing the true left ventricular wall hypertrophy.",

Radiofrequency catheter ablation of VT has been beneficial in treating selected patients with arrhythmogenic foci of monomorphic VT. The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD) is the most effective treatment for patients with life-threatening VT or ventricular fibrillation. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association class I indications for an AICD are discussed. Other indications for an AICD are discussed.

    "919": "Demographic shifts toward an increasingly older population have resulted in a high prevalence of persons taking cardiovascular medication. Many patients on cardiovascular medications will require surgical intervention for conditions often unrelated to their cardiovascular pathology. Cardiologists and anesthesiologists alike must be knowledgeable about the potential interactions between cardiovascular drugs and anesthetics agents or adjuvant therapies administered perioperatively. Current recommendations suggest that beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, amiodarone, and alpha2 agonists should be continued throughout the perioperative period, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, and diuretics should be discontinued on the morning of surgery and resumed in the immediate postoperative period, unless contraindicated.", 
    "920": "A growing body of evidence indicates that the metabolic syndrome and hypertension are interrelated at an epidemiological as well as pathophysiological level. Due to the high prevalence of concomitant signs of subclinical organ damage and the high risk of cardiorenal complications, hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome are to be considered at high risk. Although the management of this condition must begin with the implementation of a healthy lifestyle and dietary habits, these measures are usually insufficient to adequately control blood pressure values and reduce the cardiovascular risk in the long term. Therefore, in the presence of persistent blood pressure values above 140/90 mmHg, pharmacological antihypertensive therapy is often required to reach the recommended target of less than 130/80 mmHg. In the absence of specific, compelling indications to the contrary, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and calcium-channel blockers should be preferred over diuretics and beta-blockers. However, diuretics, preferably at a low dosage, are often necessary to obtain satisfactory blood pressure control. The combination of diuretics and beta-blockers should be avoided, if possible, in patients with prediabetes or diabetes.",

Thrombolytic therapy has been shown to reduce mortality similarly in men and women. In addition, percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndromes is as effective in women as in men. However, after hospital discharge, medical treatment carries different benefits in men and women. Aspirin has not been definitively proven to prevent cardiovascular events in women. Men and women respond differently to statins. Men may experience a greater benefit than women from angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. \u03b2-Blockers substantially improve survival in women, with possibly a greater benefit than in men. Clopidogrel appears to be equally effective in reducing cardiovascular events in both men and women. Our report will review current knowledge supporting sex differences in the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic heart disease.

In part, this is due to the structure of ACE, a protein composed of two independent catalytic domains. Until very recently, little was known regarding the specific in vivo role of each ACE domain, and they were commonly regarded as equivalent. This is not true, as shown by mouse models with a genetic inactivation of either the ACE N- or C-domain. In vivo, most angiotensin II is produced by the ACE C-domain. Some peptides, such as the anti-fibrotic peptide AcSDKP, are substrates only of the ACE N-domain. Knowing the in vivo role of each ACE domain has great significance for developing ACE domain-specific inhibitors and for understanding the full effects of the anti-ACE pharmaceuticals in widespread clinical use.",

The multiple and varied effects of these agents allows the renin-angiotensin system to play a wide role in the pathology of hypertension, cardiovascular health, and renal function. Our ability to begin to intervene upon the complex cycle of hormone and other biochemical agent production within the renin-angiotensin system began with the advent of the first orally active ACE-I (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor), captopril, in 1981. AIIRAs (angiotensin II receptor blockers) were developed as an alternative to ACE-I, and block the interaction between angiotensin II and the angiotensin receptor. Losartan, the first commercially available AIIRA, was approved for clinical use in 1995.

    "940": "Angiotensin II (AngII) is important in regulation of vascular resistance and control of blood flow among organs and tissues. The effect of AngII on the cerebral microvasculature may be mediated or altered by endothelial-derived signals. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that blood AngII dilates neonatal pial arterioles via an endothelial-dependent mechanism but brain AngII can constrict pial arterioles by activating smooth muscle AT1 receptors. Studies used anesthetized newborn pigs with surgically implanted closed cranial windows. AngII was given either by infusion into the carotid artery ipsilateral to the cranial window or topically. Intracarotid infusion of AngII dilated pial arterioles. The dilation was blocked by systemic administration of the AT1-receptor antagonist, losartan, but unaffected by topical losartan. Topical AngII also caused dilation, but this dilation was converted to constriction by topical losartan. In piglets pretreated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, enalapril, topical AngII constricted, rather than dilated, pial arterioles. In enalapril-treated piglets, light/dye endothelial injury blocked dilation to intracarotid AngII but did not affect constriction to topical AngII. Either indomethacin or l-nitroarginine methyl ester blocked the dilation to intraluminal AngII, but neither affected constriction to topical AngII. Chromium mesoporphyrin, that inhibits heme oxygenase, did not affect responses to either topical or intravascular AngII. These data are consistent with the hypotheses that: (a) circulating AngII dilates pial arterioles via endothelial AT(1) receptor-derived relaxing factors, notably prostanoids and nitric oxide; (b) direct AT(1) receptor activation on the brain side of the blood-brain barrier by AngII causes AT(1) receptor-mediated constriction that can mask underlying AT(1) receptor-independent dilation when ACE is inhibited. Clinical manipulation of the renin-angiotensin system will have disparate actions on cerebral circulation depending on the functional integrity of the intima and ACE.", 
    "941": "The thiol-specific derivatization reagent monobromobimane (MBB) is applied--for the first time--under flow conditions. Sequential injection analysis allows the handling of precise volumes of the reagent in the micro-liter range. The effect of the main chemical and instrumental variables was investigated using captopril (CAP), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and penicillamine (PEN) as representative pharmaceutically active thiols. Previously reported hydrolysis of MBB due to interaction with nucleophilic components of the buffers was avoided kinetically under flow conditions. The proposed analytical scheme is suitable for the fluorimetric determination of thiols at a sampling rate of 36 h(-1).", 
    "942": "Hyperuricemia appears to be related to metabolic syndrome (MS), but its impact on cardiovascular risk in patients with MS is unclear. We evaluated the impact of hyperuricemia on cardiovascular risk in patients with MS. Of 2,963 patients with coronary artery disease enrolled in the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention study, 1,410 had MS, as established by the presence of \u22653 of the following 5 criteria: serum fasting glucose >110 mg/dl, triglycerides >150 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dl in men and <50 mg/dl in women, systolic and diastolic blood pressures >130 and 80 mm Hg, respectively, and body mass index >28 kg/m\u00b2. The remaining 1,553 patients had no MS. Primary end points were defined as occurrence of acute myocardial infarction or sudden cardiac death. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid levels >7.0 mg/dl in men and >6.0 mg/dl in women, respectively. Higher rate of primary end point was noted in hyperuricemic patients (n = 284) versus normouricemic patients (n = 1,126) with MS (20.1% and 15.3%, respectively, p = 0.05). After adjustment for age, gender, smoking, diabetes, previous myocardial infarction, hypertension, New York Heart Association classes II to IV, estimated glomerular filtration rate, body mass index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, diuretics, antiplatelets, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2 blockers, and bezafibrate treatment, hyperuricemic patients with MS demonstrated significantly higher risk for the primary end point compared to normouricemic patients with MS (hazard ratio 1.45, 95% confidence interval 1.00 to 2.17, p = 0.05). In conclusion, hyperuricemia is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in patients with MS.", 
    "943": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by accumulation of visceral fat associated with the clustering of metabolic and pathophysiological cardiovascular risk factors: impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Although the definition of MetS is different among countries, visceral obesity is an indispensable component of MetS. A growing body of evidence suggests that increased oxidative stress to adipocytes is central to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease in MetS. Increased oxidative stress to adipocytes causes dysregulated expression of inflammation-related adipocytokines in MetS, which contributes to obesity-associated vasculopathy and cardiovascular risk primarily through endothelial dysfunction. The purpose of present review is to unravel the mechanistic link between oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk in MetS, focusing on insulin resistance, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Then, therapeutic opportunities translated from the bench to bedside will be provided to develop novel strategies to cardiovascular risk factors in MetS.", 
    "944": "Prolyl-rich peptides derived from hydrolysates of bovine caseins have been previously shown to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, suggesting that they may also be able to inhibit the enzymatic activities of prolyl-specific peptidases. This study shows that peptides derived from \u03b1(S1)-casein and \u03b2-casein inhibited the enzymatic activities of purified recombinant matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9. The inhibitory efficacy was sequence-dependent. These peptides also selectively inhibited the enzymatic activities of prolyl-amino-peptidases, prolyl-amino-dipeptidases, and prolyl-endopeptidases in extracts of HT-29 and SW480 human colon carcinoma cells, but not in intact cells. They were not cytotoxic or growth inhibitory for these cells. Thus, the prolyl-rich selected peptides were good and selective inhibitors of MMPs and post-proline-cleaving proteases, demonstrating their potential to control inadequate proteolytic activity in the human digestive tract, without inducing cytotoxic effects.", 
    "945": "Ischaemic mitral regurgitation is a frequent complication of left ventricular global or regional pathological remodelling due to chronic coronary artery disease. It is not a valve disease but represents the valvular consequences of increased tethering forces (papillary muscles displacement leading to a more apical position of the leaflets and their coaptation point) and reduced closing forces (reduced contractility, dyssynchrony of the papillary muscles, intra-left ventricular dyssynchrony). Although mitral regurgitation has an unloading effect and reduces impedance, the volume overload begets further left ventricular dilatation, increases ventricular wall stress leading to worsened performance. Ischaemic mitral regurgitation is characteristically dynamic: its severity may vary with haemodynamic conditions. Both the severity of ischaemic mitral regurgitation and its dynamic component worsen prognosis. There are numerous possible treatment modalities, but the management of the individual patient remains difficult. Medical therapy is mandatory; revascularization procedures are frequently not sufficient to reduce mitral regurgitation; the role of combined surgical therapy by mitral valve repair is not yet defined in the absence of large randomized trial. Some patients are good candidates for cardiac resynchronization therapy that may reduce the amount of regurgitation. New therapeutic targets are under investigation.",

Our primary outcomes were cancer and cancer-related deaths.", 
    "948": "We identified 70 randomised controlled trials (148 comparator groups) with 324,168 participants. In the network meta-analysis (fixed-effect model), we recorded no difference in the risk of cancer with ARBs (proportion with cancer 2\u00b704%; odds ratio 1\u00b701, 95% CI 0\u00b793-1\u00b709), ACEi (2\u00b703%; 1\u00b700, 0\u00b792-1\u00b709), \u03b2 blockers (1\u00b797%; 0\u00b797, 0\u00b788-1\u00b707), CCBs (2\u00b711%; 1\u00b705, 0\u00b796-1\u00b713), diuretics (2\u00b702%; 1\u00b700, 0\u00b790-1\u00b711), or other controls (1\u00b795%, 0\u00b797, 0\u00b774-1\u00b724) versus placebo (2\u00b702%). There was an increased risk with the combination of ACEi plus ARBs (2\u00b730%, 1\u00b714, 1\u00b702-1\u00b728); however, this risk was not apparent in the random-effects model (odds ratio 1\u00b715, 95% CI 0\u00b792-1\u00b738). No differences were detected in cancer-related mortality for ARBs (death rate 1\u00b733%; odds ratio 1\u00b700, 95% CI 0\u00b787-1\u00b715), ACEi (1\u00b725%; 0\u00b795, 0\u00b781-1\u00b710), \u03b2 blockers (1\u00b723%; 0\u00b793, 0\u00b780-1\u00b708), CCBs (1\u00b727%; 0\u00b796, 0\u00b782-1\u00b711), diuretics (1\u00b730%; 0\u00b798, 0\u00b784-1\u00b713), other controls (1\u00b743%; 1\u00b708, 0\u00b778-1\u00b746), and ACEi plus ARBs (1\u00b745%; 1\u00b710, 0\u00b790-1\u00b732). In direct comparison meta-analyses, similar results were recorded for all antihypertensive classes, except for an increased risk of cancer with ACEi and ARB combination (OR 1\u00b714, 95% CI 1\u00b704-1\u00b724; p=0\u00b7004) and with CCBs (1\u00b706, 1\u00b701-1\u00b712; p=0\u00b702). However, we noted no significant differences in cancer-related mortality. On the basis of trial sequential analysis, our results suggest no evidence of even a 5-10% relative risk (RR) increase of cancer and cancer-related deaths with any individual class of antihypertensive drugs studied. However, for the ACEi and ARB combination, the cumulative Z curve crossed the trial sequential monitoring boundary, suggesting firm evidence for at least a 10% RR increase in cancer risk.",

Rats fed a low-salt diet served as controls. Rats on the high-salt diet developed massive proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis; these changes were attenuated by both doses of pitavastatin. The amounts of mRNAs or proteins for mineralocorticoid receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, osteopontin, macrophage infiltration, and NADPH subunits (gp91phox, p22phox, and Rac1) were significantly higher in the failing kidneys of vehicle-treated rats than in the kidneys of control rats. Either dose of pitavastatin significantly attenuated these changes. These effects of pitavastatin were mimicked by those of apocynin and E64d. Pretreatment with pitavastatin and apocynin inhibited mRNA and protein of mineralocorticoid receptor induced by angiotensin II in cultured podocytes.",

Vasoconstriction and sodium and water retention, due to angiotensin II and aldosterone promote atherosclerotic processes. Theres recent evidence from animal and clinical studies to consider angiotensin II as a mediator of inflammation, which induces atherosclerotic plaque development and heart remodeling. Also angiotensin II causes endothelial dysfunction by inducing cytokine and chemokine secretion. The pharmacological blockade of the renin angiotensin system has positive influence on clinical outcomes of patients with cardiovascular diseases independently of the blood pressure lowering effect. This review summarizes studies about the role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARA) and renin inhibitors in vascular inflammatory processes in atherosclerosis.", 
    "963": "In 102 patients with high risk (52 patients with history of myocardial infarction, 50 patients with history of cerebral stroke within previous 6-48 months) arterial hypertension (AH) we studied clinical efficacy on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) lisinopril, calcium antagonist felodipine, and nonselective - -blocker carvedilol in dependence on salt sensitivity of AH. Efficacy of treatment was assessed with the help of office pressure measurement and 24 hour arterial pressure monitoring before and after 12 weeks of therapy. Patients who showed 10 or more mm Hg lowering of AP at transition from high salt (15 g/day) to low salt ( 3 g/day) diet were considered salt sensitive. On the basis of obtained results optimal for the treatment of AH in salt resistant patients are ACEI while in the treatment of salt sensitive patients it is expedient to administer calcium antagonists. The use of -adrenoblockers is equally effective in AH with various salt sensitivity.",

Angiotensin-II has been shown to play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of various organs, especially the cardiovascular system. Some angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists are reported to inhibit proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. We investigated whether telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist protects against experimental autoimmune myocarditis by suppression of inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Experimental autoimmune myocarditis was induced in Lewis rats by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin. The rats were divided into two groups and treated with either telmisartan (10mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 21days. Age-matched normal rats without immunization were also included in this study. Myocardial functional parameters were significantly improved by treatment with telmisartan compared with vehicle-treated rats. Increased myocardial mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL-6), IL-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3] were also suppressed by telmisartan treatment compared with vehicle-treated rats. Myocardial protein expressions of NADPH oxidase subunits p47phox, Nox-4, and gp91phox, myocardial levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and myocardial apoptosis were also significantly decreased by telmisartan treatment compared with vehicle-treated rats. Further, telmisartan significantly decreased endoplasmic reticulum stress markers in experimental autoimmune myocarditis rats. These findings suggest that telmisartan protects against experimental autoimmune myocarditis in rats, at least in part by suppressing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress; however, further investigations are needed before clinical use.", 
    "969": "In recent years, a major development in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) is the use of catheter ablation, and a significant number of patients may benefit from this mode of therapy. On a global scale, it may not be feasible to deal with most patients solely on the basis of ablation. Therefore, it is likely that much of the therapy for AF will continue to rely on antiarrhythmic agents for maintaining sinus rhythm. For many years, amiodarone and sotalol have been the dominant antiarrhythmic agents, with amiodarone being the most effective antiarrhythmic in suppressing AF; however, amiodarone use is limited due to concerns of end-organ toxicity. Upstream therapies, such as statins, fish oil, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers may also provide additive efficacy to these and other membrane-active antiarrhythmics. In recent years, a number of new agents are being developed and the first successful congener of amiodarone, dronedarone, has been shown to be effective in controlling AF and reducing cardiovascular hospitalization. This paper explores the possibility of augmenting the extent of controlling AF by combining multiple potent antiarrhythmic agents old and new.",

    "980": "Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity and one of the most frequent reasons for hospital admission in the United States and Europe. Currently, more than 50% of HF patients have a normal (N) left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (LVEF >50%). The main pathophysiologic processes involved in HFNEF are increased LV stiffness and abnormal relaxation, resulting in impaired LV filling. Hypertension and myocardial ischemia are the most common causes of HFNEF. Precipitating factors include volume overload, tachycardia, physical exercise, systemic stressors (such as fever and infection), arrhythmia, increased salt intake, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. There is little evidence to guide treatment, as previously HFNEF patients have been excluded from clinical trials on the basis of a normal LVEF. Survival improved over time in patients with reduced (R) EF (HFREF) (LVEF <40%), reflecting the beneficial effects of treatment in this phenotype. However, survival did not improve for HFNEF patients. The approach to the treatment of HFNEF patients should focus on reducing LV filling pressure, controlling hypertension, modifying ischemia, and improving LV relaxation. Therefore, diuretics are suitable for HFNEF patients to reduce ventricular filling pressure. Hypertension can be treated by using multiple agents if necessary. Drugs of particular interest and recommended to treat hypertension are calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and antagonists of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone antagonists. Ischemic heart disease can be treated with antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulants, and \u03b2-blockers. Heart rate control in atrial fibrillation can be achieved with \u03b2-blockers and digoxin. Finally, ACE inhibitors and ARBs could potentially decrease LV hypertrophy in hypertensive patients with HFNEF.",

Angiotensin II stimulates TF expression both in vitro and in vivo, an effect abolished by ACE or angiotensin II receptor inhibition. Moreover, renin-angiotensin system blockers, including aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, are able to modulate TF expression in monocytes and vascular endothelial cells activated by inflammatory cytokines. This behavior is suggestive of anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties of renin-angiotensin system blockers, and is compatible with the possibility that blocking local renin-angiotensin system activation might downregulate TF, thus reducing the risk of ischemic complications in hypertensive patients.",

Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that patients treated with benazepril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or amlodipine may achieve beneficial renal outcomes that extend beyond blood pressure control. Furthermore, the recent Avoiding Cardiovascular Events Through Combination Therapy in Patients Living with Systolic Hypertension (ACCOMPLISH) trial showed decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with benazepril when administered as a cotreatment. An additional novel therapeutic area for benazepril is atrial fibrillation. Differences between combination therapies have implications for which patients may be best suited to particular interventions, and further studies are required to fully ascertain this potential.", 
    "994": "The overactivation of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system accounts for many cardiovascular and renal abnormalities. At several levels of its cascade, the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system can be efficiently inhibited, of which interruption of the generation of angiotensin I by renin inhibition is considered most efficacious. All of these interruptions (renin inhibition, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, and AT1 receptor blockade) increase plasma renin levels by inhibiting the negative feedback loop exerted by angiotensin II on renin production. Recent studies show that both prorenin and renin activate angiotensin II-independent signaling cascade through (pro)renin receptor, a new-fangled player of the old renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The probable mechanisms by which prorenin, renin, and (pro)renin receptors are functionally interrelated in pathophysiological conditions have been debated over the past decade without satisfactory conclusion. We revisited these areas and critically examined the relationship between elevated levels of circulating prorenin and renin-induced activation of the (pro)renin receptor and incidences of hypertension and end-organ damage. The complexity of the (pro)renin receptor has grown up with recent reports that this multifunctional receptor is a component of the Wnt receptor complex. This complexity and the receptor's function as an adaptor between the Wnt receptor and the vacuolar H+-ATPase complex has also been addressed in this review.", 
    "995": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is part of the blood pressure regulating system. Its main effector peptide is angiotensin II (Ang II). Although it may induce hypertension, the proinflammatory, profibrotic, and prothrombotic effects are mainly mediated by effects of Ang II on the cellular and molecular level that are independent of blood pressure. Therefore, pharmacotherapeutic intervention within the RAAS is an important treatment modality for patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases, even those who are not hypertensive. In addition to the blood pressure lowering and vasculoprotective (pleiotropic) effects of angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor blockers (ARBs), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, regenerative progenitor cell therapy emerges as an auxiliary therapy to improve regeneration of the vascular endothelium. This review focuses on the growing knowledge about regenerating vascular cells, their response to RAAS effectors, and RAAS-modulating pharmacotherapy in the context of endothelial cell damage and regeneration.",

They were randomized to take losartan 50 mg per day or ramipril 5 mg per day for 1 month and titrated up to 100 mg per day and 10 mg per day for 13 months, respectively. At baseline, 1, 2 and 14 months after therapy initiation, we evaluated the following parameters: body weight, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), M-value, adiponectin (ADN), resistin (r), retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4), visfatin, vaspin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). No variation of body weight, BMI, FPG or vaspin was obtained with either treatment. We recorded a similar improvement in SBP, DBP and Hs-CRP with both treatments; however, losartan also increased M-value, ADN and visfatin, whereas ramipril did not. Furthermore, losartan decreased r, RBP-4, MMP-2 and MMP-9, whereas ramipril did not have any effect on these parameters. In conclusion, we observed that short-term treatment with losartan improved several metabolic parameters (M-value, ADN, RBP-4, r and visfatin) and decreased vascular remodeling biomarkers (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in hypertensive subjects, whereas ramipril did not.",

Blood pressure (BP) was recorded by telemetry, and renal functions were evaluated in freely moving rats. Despite similar BP reduction after perindopril withdrawal in P0.4 and P1.5 groups, greater decrease in proteinuria was observed in P1.5 group. Double or triple therapy prevented the hypertension of LH rats, but without any persistent antihypertensive or antiproteinuric effect after its withdrawal. Salt load elicited an increase in BP that was similar in untreated LH and both perindopril-pretreated groups (+30 mm Hg), but more pronounced in double therapy\u2013pretreated or triple therapy\u2013pretreated groups (+50 mm Hg). The pressure\u2013natriuresis curve shifted to lower BP levels in P0.4 and P1.5 groups, whereas it was blunted in double and triple therapy groups.

Chronic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the development of hypertension, cardiac and renal diseases. RAAS inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes. However, studies have shown that residual morbidity and mortality remains high, despite current optimal treatment. More comprehensive control of the RAAS might provide additional reductions in morbidity and mortality. Direct renin inhibitors such aliskiren offer the potential for enhanced RAAS control as they target the system at the point of activation, thereby reducing plasma renin activity; by contrast, ACEI and ARBs increase plasma renin activity. The efficacy of aliskiren in the reduction of major clinical events is being tested in large ongoing clinical trials.

Blood pressure control in women (21.8%) and men (21.2%) was similar, despite a slightly older age (64.9 vs 63 years, p<0.0001). Women had less concomitant cardiovascular risk factors and organ damage, with the exception of diabetes, cerebrovascular and renal disease, than men. They received more antihypertensive drugs than men (1.7 \u00b1 0.9 vs 1.5 \u00b1 0.9, p<0.0001).

The heart and kidneys act in tandem to regulate blood pressure, vascular tone, diuresis, natriuresis, intravascular volume homeostasis, peripheral tissue perfusion, and oxygenation. Cardiorenal syndrome is a pathophysiological condition in which combined cardiac and renal dysfunction amplifies the progression of failure of the individual organs, and it has an extremely poor prognosis. The identification of patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying each subtype will help physicians to understand the clinical derangements and provide the rationale for management strategies. The evidence from clinical trials conducted on heart failure patients with significant kidney dysfunction is insufficient because most patients are recruited from populations with relatively well-preserved kidney function. In severe volume-loaded patients who are refractory to diuretics and also have kidney dysfunction, the management of cardiorenal dysfunction is challenging, and effective therapy is lacking. In the absence of definitive clinical trials, treatment decisions must be based on a combination of information regarding the individual patient information and an understanding of the individual treatment options.",

    "1018": "We report the first observed case of a young man who suffered of large and unsuspected left bowel ischemia following an elective right open hernioplasty. A 54-year-old man had a 2-year history of right inguinal reducible mass and was admitted to hospital for an elective day case open inguinal hernioplasty for a direct right inguinal hernia. Apart from mild hypertension controlled with ACE inhibitor, he was medically fit and well. The patient was submitted to open tension-free mesh repair with polypropylene preshaped mesh with local infiltration anesthesia and additive sedation with midazolam. The local anesthesia and surgery were uneventful and he was discharged home on the same day as per day case protocol. He was readmitted about 12 h after discharge with a history of central and left lower abdominal pain with palpable mass, and distension and fever (38\u00b0C). After imaging and laboratory studies the patient was submitted to explorative surgery with the suspicion of left colonic ischemia. After intraoperative confirmation we performed standard left hemicolectomy. The postoperative course was uneventful; the patient was discharged in good general condition on the 7th postoperative day. Actually, the patient is in follow-up, with normal coagulation and hemochromocytometric pattern, asymptomatic for hypercholesterolemia and atrial flutter/fibrillation. Complications relating to bowel during open techniques of hernia repair are limited to two situations: the freeing of an incarcerated or strangulated segment of bowel and inadvertent laceration of large bowel in the presence of a sliding hernia. Following this strange case of colonic ischemia, a boolean Medline search (terms: hernia, complication, repair, groin, herniorrhaphy, hernioplasty, all major MESH subjects without language restriction) revealed no previous similar cases reported. However, to our knowledge, there is another trouble hypothesis: not causality but casualty. In conclusion, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of large left bowel ischemia following right open hernioplasty. We can conclude that the presence of a dolichocolon is an added risk factor for this rare and uneventful complication, but further investigations and case reports are necessary to estabilish the real causality.", 
    "1019": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and loss of renal parenchyma accelerates atherosclerosis in animal models. Macrophages are central to atherogenesis because they regulate cholesterol traffic and inflammation in the arterial wall. CKD influences macrophage behavior at multiple levels, rendering them proatherogenic. Even at normal creatinine levels, macrophages from uninephrectomized Apoe(-/-) mice are enriched in cholesterol owing to downregulation of cholesterol transporter ATP-binding cassette subfamily A member 1 levels and activation of nuclear factor \u03baB, which leads to impaired cholesterol efflux. Interestingly, treatment with an angiotensin-II-receptor blocker (ARB) improves these effects. Moreover, atherosclerotic aortas from Apoe(-/-) mice transplanted into renal-ablated normocholesterolemic recipients show plaque progression and increased macrophage content instead of the substantial regression seen in recipient mice with intact kidneys. ARBs reduce atherosclerosis development in mice with partial renal ablation. These results, combined with the clinical benefits of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and ARBs in patients with CKD, suggest an important role for the angiotensin system in the enhanced susceptibility to atherosclerosis seen across the spectrum of CKD. The role of macrophages could explain why these therapies may be effective in end-stage renal disease, one of the few conditions in which statins show no clinical benefit.",

Enalapril significantly attenuated the decrease in percent fractional shortening (P < .05) and prevented the doxorubicin-associated reduction in respiratory efficiency and cytosolic adenosine triphosphate content (P < .05). Enalapril also abolished the robust doxorubicin-induced increase in free radical formation.",

    "1041": "Angiotensin II and aldosterone are key factors responsible for the structural and neurohormonal remodeling of the atria and ventricles in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antiarrhythmic effects of spironolactone compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with recurrent AF. A cohort of 164 consecutive patients (mean age 66 years, 87 men), with an average 4-year history of recurrent AF episodes, was enrolled in a prospective, randomized, 12-month trial with 4 treatment arms: group A, spironolactone, enalapril, and a \u03b2 blocker; group B, spironolactone and a \u03b2 blocker; group C, enalapril plus a \u03b2 blocker; and group D, a \u03b2 blocker alone. The primary end point of the trial was the presence of symptomatic AF episodes documented on the electrocardiogram. At 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12 months, a significant (p < 0.001) reduction had occurred in the incidence of AF episodes in both spironolactone-treated groups (group A, spironolactone, enalapril, and a \u03b2 blocker; and group B, spironolactone plus a \u03b2 blocker) compared to the incidence in patients treated with enalapril and a \u03b2 blocker (group C) or a \u03b2 blocker alone (group D). No significant difference was seen in AF recurrences between patients taking spironolactone and a \u03b2 blocker with (group A) and without (group B) enalapril. No significant differences were found in the systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate among the groups before and after 1 year of follow-up. In conclusion, combined spironolactone plus \u03b2-blocker treatment might be a simple and valuable option in preventing AF episodes in patients with normal left ventricular function and a history of refractory paroxysmal AF.", 
    "1042": "Cardiac fibroblasts are the most abundant cell type in the heart, and play a key role in the maintenance and repair of the myocardium following damage such as myocardial infarction by transforming into a cardiac myofibroblast (CMF) phenotype. Repair occurs through controlled proliferation and migration, which are Ca(2+) dependent processes, and often requires the cells to operate within a hypoxic environment. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce infarct size through the promotion of bradykinin (BK) stability. Although CMF express BK receptors, their activity under the reduced O(2) conditions that occur following infarct are entirely unexplored. Using Fura-2 microfluorimetry on primary human CMF, we found that hypoxia significantly increased the mobilisation of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores in response to BK whilst capacitative Ca(2+) entry (CCE) remained unchanged. The enhanced store mobilisation was due to a striking increase in CMF intracellular Ca(2+)-store content under hypoxic conditions. However, BK-induced CMF migration or proliferation was not affected following hypoxic exposure, suggesting that Ca(2+) influx rather than mobilisation is of primary importance in CMF migration and proliferation.", 
    "1043": "Fabry disease (FD) is a progressive, X-linked inherited disorder of glycosphingolipid metabolism due to deficient or absent lysosomal \u03b1-galactosidase A activity. FD is pan-ethnic and the reported annual incidence of 1 in 100,000 may underestimate the true prevalence of the disease. Classically affected hemizygous males, with no residual \u03b1-galactosidase A activity may display all the characteristic neurological (pain), cutaneous (angiokeratoma), renal (proteinuria, kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia), cochleo-vestibular and cerebrovascular (transient ischemic attacks, strokes) signs of the disease while heterozygous females have symptoms ranging from very mild to severe. Deficient activity of lysosomal \u03b1-galactosidase A results in progressive accumulation of globotriaosylceramide within lysosomes, believed to trigger a cascade of cellular events. Demonstration of marked \u03b1-galactosidase A deficiency is the definitive method for the diagnosis of hemizygous males. Enzyme analysis may occasionnally help to detect heterozygotes but is often inconclusive due to random X-chromosomal inactivation so that molecular testing (genotyping) of females is mandatory. In childhood, other possible causes of pain such as rheumatoid arthritis and 'growing pains' must be ruled out. In adulthood, multiple sclerosis is sometimes considered. Prenatal diagnosis, available by determination of enzyme activity or DNA testing in chorionic villi or cultured amniotic cells is, for ethical reasons, only considered in male fetuses. Pre-implantation diagnosis is possible. The existence of atypical variants and the availability of a specific therapy singularly complicate genetic counseling. A disease-specific therapeutic option - enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant human \u03b1-galactosidase A - has been recently introduced and its long term outcome is currently still being investigated. Conventional management consists of pain relief with analgesic drugs, nephroprotection (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptors blockers) and antiarrhythmic agents, whereas dialysis or renal transplantation are available for patients experiencing end-stage renal failure. With age, progressive damage to vital organ systems develops and at some point, organs may start to fail in functioning. End-stage renal disease and life-threatening cardiovascular or cerebrovascular complications limit life-expectancy of untreated males and females with reductions of 20 and 10 years, respectively, as compared to the general population. While there is increasing evidence that long-term enzyme therapy can halt disease progression, the importance of adjunctive therapies should be emphasized and the possibility of developing an oral therapy drives research forward into active site specific chaperones.", 
    "1044": "An additional approach may be essential to reduce recurrences of atrial fibrillation (AF) after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). We examined the efficacy of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RAS-B) in suppressing AF recurrences after PVI.", 
    "1045": "We retrospectively studied 264 consecutive patients (195 male, median age: 63 years) who underwent successful PVI of paroxysmal (n = 94) or persistent AF (n = 170). RAS-B treatment was performed in 145 patients (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; n = 13, angiotensin receptor blockers; n = 129, both; n = 3). Echocardiography was performed before and 3 months after the ablation to examine the occurrence of left atrial structural reverse remodeling (LA-RR). After a median follow-up of 195 (interquartile range: 95-316) days, AF recurred in 51 (19.3%) patients. A Cox regression analysis revealed that AF recurrence was significantly lower in the patients with RAS-B than in those without (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.41 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.71], P = 0.002). After a multivariate adjustment for potential confounders, the use of RAS-B (HR = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.19-0.77], P = 0.007) and type of AF (HR = 0.30 [95% CI: 0.13-0.66], P = 0.003) were the independent predictors for AF recurrence during the entire follow-up. Although effect of RAS-B was not significant during the early follow-up (<3 month), it was the only independent predictor during the late follow-up (>3 months) (HR = 0.21 [95% CI: 0.08-0.53], P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in LA-RR occurrence regarding RAS-B medication. The use of RAS-B was an independent predictor of late AF recurrences irrespective of an early LA-RR occurrence.", 
    "1046": "Treatment with RAS-B significantly reduced the AF recurrence after PVI. This benefit became more prominent 3 months after the PVI.", 
    "1047": "ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) 2 is expressed in the heart and kidney and metabolizes Ang (angiotensin) II to Ang-(1-7) a peptide that acts via the Ang-(1-7) or mas receptor. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of Ang-(1-7) on blood pressure and cardiac remodelling in a rat model of renal mass ablation. Male SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats underwent STNx (subtotal nephrectomy) and were treated for 10 days with vehicle, the ACE inhibitor ramipril (oral 1 mg\u00b7kg(-1) of body weight\u00b7day(-1)) or Ang-(1-7) (subcutaneous 24 \u03bcg\u00b7kg(-1) of body weight\u00b7h(-1)) (all n = 15 per group). A control group (n = 10) of sham-operated rats were also studied. STNx rats were hypertensive (P<0.01) with renal impairment (P<0.001), cardiac hypertrophy (P<0.001) and fibrosis (P<0.05), and increased cardiac ACE (P<0.001) and ACE2 activity (P<0.05). Ramipril reduced blood pressure (P<0.01), improved cardiac hypertrophy (P<0.001) and inhibited cardiac ACE (P<0.001). By contrast, Ang-(1-7) infusion in STNx was associated with further increases in blood pressure (P<0.05), cardiac hypertrophy (P<0.05) and fibrosis (P<0.01). Ang-(1-7) infusion also increased cardiac ACE activity (P<0.001) and reduced cardiac ACE2 activity (P<0.05) compared with STNx-vehicle rats. Our results add to the increasing evidence that Ang-(1-7) may have deleterious cardiovascular effects in kidney failure and highlight the need for further in vivo studies of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/mas receptor axis in kidney disease.", 
    "1048": "To compare the efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil (O) and ramipril (R) in elderly patients with essential arterial hypertension.", 
    "1049": "After a 2-week placebo washout, 351 elderly hypertensive patients aged 65-89 years (office sitting diastolic blood pressure, DBP, 90-109 mmHg and office sitting systolic blood pressure, SBP, 140-179 mmHg) were randomized double-blind to 12-week treatment with O 10 mg or R 2.5 mg once daily. After the first 2 and 6 weeks, doses could be doubled in non-normalized (blood pressure <140/90 mmHg for non-diabetic and <130/80 mmHg for diabetic) subjects, up to 40 mg for O and 10 mg for R. Office blood pressures were assessed at randomization, after 2, 6 and 12 weeks of treatment; 24-h ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) was recorded at randomization and after 12 weeks.", 
    "1050": "At week 12, in the intention-to-treat population (170 patients O and 175 R) the rate of normalized subjects was significantly larger in the O group (38.8% vs 26.3% R; p = 0.013). Baseline-adjusted mean sitting office blood pressure reduction at final visit was not significantly greater under O [SBP: 16.6 (95% confidence interval 14.0/19.2) mmHg vs 13.0 (10.4/15.6) mmHg R, p = 0.206; DBP: 11.8 (10.3/13.3) mmHg vs 10.5 (9.0/12.0) mmHg, p = 0.351]. In the subgroup of patients with valid ABP recordings (38 O and 47 R), the reduction in 24-h average blood pressure was significantly (p < 0.01) larger with O [SBP: 8.9 (9.8/8.1) and DBP: 5.7 (6.3/5.1) mmHg] than with R [6.7 (7.9/5.6) and 4.4 (5.1/3.7) mmHg]. The superiority of O was particularly evident in the last 4 h from the dosing interval. The proportion of patients with drug-related adverse events was comparable in the two groups (4.0% O vs 4.5% R), as well as the number of patients discontinuing study drug because of a side-effect (8 O vs 7 R).", 
    "1051": "In elderly patients with essential arterial hypertension, O provides an effective, prolonged and well tolerated blood pressure control, with significantly better blood pressure normalization than R and represents a useful option among first-line drug treatments of hypertension in this age group.", 
    "1052": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (angiotensin receptor blockers) have been shown to be effective drugs in the management of hypertension and to have beneficial effects along the cardiovascular continuum. However, due to compensatory mechanisms, both of these types of agent increase plasma renin activity, which has been reported to have deleterious effects on patient outcomes. Aliskiren is the first nonpeptide orally administered direct renin inhibitor available on the market. Reported data have shown that aliskiren effectively reduces BP alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, and has a good tolerability profile. Moreover, this agent reduces plasma renin activity, which in theory could have additional clinical benefits. However, clinical trials analyzing the effects of aliskiren on mortality are still ongoing."
