The three enzyme fractions hydrolysed angiotensin I, angiotensinogen (AG) and synthetic AG(1-14) to form angiotensin II. With angiotensin I as substrate, pH optima were 6.5 for rSMT3, 6.8 for rSMT4 and 7.5 for rPT1. With AG(1-14), the three enzymes had optimal activity at pH 7.5. The three enzymes had negligible activity upon a kallikrein substrate, Ac-Phe-Arg-Nan. The enzymes were inhibited by aprotinin, soybean trypsin inhibitor and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride but not by two angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, ethylenediaminetetracetic acid or enalaprilat. N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (1 mM) inhibited rPT1 and rSMT4 but not rSMT3. Molecular weights (SDS-PAGE) were 31,700 for rSMT3, 29,800 for rSMT4 and 28,100 for rPT1. Total activity in the prostate is 150-times lower than in the submandibular gland, where 92% of the tonin activity is related to rSMT4. Physical and chemical properties suggest that rSMT4 is tonin, whereas rSMT3 and rPT1 are tonin-like enzymes which can generate angiotensin II from different substrates.", 
    "1": "A radionuclide ventriculographic procedure for the accurate quantification of aortic insufficiency has been developed, and its use in follow-up, pharmacotherapy and surgical planning tested. In 28 patients, follow-up over a period of 20 months revealed only slow progression of the chronic aortic insufficiency; worsening of the symptoms leading to the need for valve replacement was associated with a rapid deterioration of objective parameters. In patients with a stable condition, captopril administered for 4-8 weeks failed to reduce left ventricular overload to any significant extent, while reduction in volume overload was observed in patients with accompanying congestive heart failure or systemic hypertension. Clinical analysis revealed that, as a rule, the indication for valve replacement must be based on follow-up examination. If radionuclide ventriculography reveals a disproportionate enlargement of the ventricle, surgery is indicated even in the absence of symptoms.", 
    "2": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) of the concentric type is the classic cardiac adaptation to sustained arterial hypertension. Data from the Framingham cohort have shown that patients with LVH have a severalfold higher risk of sudden death, acute myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular morbidity than those with normal hearts. Common sequelae of LVH are ventricular ectopy, impaired ventricular contractility, myocardial ischemia, and decreased left ventricular filling. The benefits of antihypertensive therapy should not be limited to lowering arterial pressure, but should extend to preventing or reducing target organ damage. A variety of antihypertensive agents, such as calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antiadrenergic drugs, and, to a lesser extent, beta blockers, have been shown to reduce LVH and to improve left ventricular filling. We have shown that calcium channel blockers diminish ventricular ectopy in parallel with the reduction of LVH, whereas antihypertensive therapy with diuretics neither reduced LVH nor suppressed ventricular ectopy, although it lowered arterial pressure to a similar extent. Whether or not these cardiac changes with antihypertensive therapies will improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with LVH remains to be documented.", 
    "3": "Approximately 60 million people in the United States have hypertension (BP greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg), 40 million have arthritis clinically suitable for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, and millions take NSAIDs for nonarthritic conditions, creating considerable potential for concomitant administration of NSAIDs and antihypertensive agents. It is estimated that more than 20 million people are on concurrent therapy. Most NSAIDs produce mild elevations of normal blood pressure levels and can partially or completely antagonize the effects of many antihypertensive drugs. The effect on blood pressure can vary from no effect to hypertensive crisis. In pooled studies, the average increase in mean arterial pressure was 10 mm Hg, and duration was short-lived or chronic. Significant interactions occur in about 1% of patients per year. The risk is greatest in the elderly, blacks, and patients with low-renin hypertension. NSAIDs may block the antihypertensive effects of thiazide and loop diuretics, beta-adrenergic blockers, alpha-adrenergic blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. No interactions have been reported with centrally acting alpha agonists or the calcium channel blockers. The mechanism of the hypertensive effects of NSAIDs seem primarily related to their ability to block the cyclo-oxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, with a resultant decrease in prostaglandin formation. The prostaglandins are important in normal modulation of renal and systemic vascular dilatation, glomerular filtration, tubular secretion of salt and water, adrenergic neurotransmission, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Blockade of salutary effects of prostaglandins by NSAIDs results in a complex series of events culminating in attenuation of the effects of many antihypertensive agents. High-risk patients treated with NSAIDs should be identified and have blood pressure, renal function, and serum potassium frequently monitored.", 
    "4": "Despite the demonstrated efficacy of traditional antihypertensive therapy in reducing blood pressure, hypertension continues to be a major cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Stepped-care therapy is a nonphysiologic approach that, due to potential metabolic derangements and stimulation of undesirable reflex responses, may not substantially reduce the cardiovascular and renal complications associated with hypertension or improve long-term survival in many hypertensive patients. Because of fundamental hemodynamic differences related to the age, race, and weight of hypertensive patients, drug treatment often elicits varying responses. Certain classes of drugs are not only more effective but also more appropriate from a physiologic standpoint in specific types of patients. Therapy selection based in part on hemodynamic mechanisms and demographic patterns is a more rational approach to patient management and may contribute to a better overall outcome than has been observed with conventional treatment.", 
    "5": "Angiotensin II is an important effector molecule controlling blood pressure and volume in the cardiovascular system. Its importance is manifested by the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II interacts with two pharmacologically distinct subtypes of cell-surface receptors, AT1 and AT2. AT1 receptors seem to mediate the major cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Here we report the isolation by expression cloning of a complementary DNA encoding a unique protein with the pharmacological specificity of a vascular AT1 receptor. Hydropathic modelling of the deduced protein suggests that it shares the seven-transmembrane-region motif with the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. Knowledge of the AT1 receptor primary sequence should now permit structural analysis, definition of the angiotensin II receptor gene family and delineation of the contribution of AT receptors to the genetic component of hypertension.", 
    "6": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and enkephalinase, two cell surface metallopeptidases, are responsible for angiotensin II formation and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) degradation, respectively, and thereby play a critical role in the metabolism of hormonal peptides exerting essentially opposite actions in cardiovascular regulations. To affect simultaneously both hormonal systems by a single molecular structure, we have designed glycoprilat and alatrioprilat [(S)-N-[3-(3,4-methylene-dioxyphenyl)-2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxoprop yl] glycine and -alanine, respectively]. In vitro the two compounds inhibit both ACE and enkephalinase activities with similar, nanomolar potencies, and in vivo, glycopril and alatriopril, the corresponding diester prodrugs, occupy the two enzyme molecules in lung at similar low dosages (0.2-0.5 mg/kg of body weight, per os). The high potency of these compounds is attributable to interaction of the methylenedioxy group with the S1 subsite of ACE and of the aromatic ring with the S1' subsite of enkephalinase. In rodents, low doses of these mixed inhibitors exert typical actions of ACE inhibitors--i.e., prevention of angiotensin I-induced hypertension--as well as of enkephalinase inhibitors--i.e., protection from 125I-ANF degradation or enhancement of diuresis and natriuresis following acute extracellular volume expansion. In view of the known counterbalanced physiological actions of the two hormonal peptides, whose metabolism is controlled by ACE and enkephalinase, mixed inhibitors of the two peptidases show promise for the treatment of various cardiovascular and salt-retention disorders.", 
    "7": "Molecular cloning of human endothelial angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II; EC 3.4.15.1) (ACE) has recently shown that the enzyme contains two large homologous domains (called here the N and C domains), each bearing a putative active site, identified by sequence comparisons with the active sites of other zinc metallopeptidases. However, the previous experiments with zinc or competitive ACE inhibitors suggested a single active site in ACE. To establish whether both domains of ACE are enzymatically active, a series of ACE mutants, each containing only one intact domain, were constructed by deletion or point mutations of putative critical residues of the other domain, and expressed in heterologous Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both domains are enzymatically active and cleave the C-terminal dipeptide of hippuryl-His-Leu or angiotensin I. Moreover, both domains have an absolute zinc requirement for activity, are activated by chloride and are sensitive to competitive ACE inhibitors, and appear to function independently. However, the two domains display different catalytic constants and different patterns of chloride activation. At high chloride concentrations, the C domain hydrolyzes the two substrates tested faster than does the N domain. His-361,365 and His-959,963 are established as essential residues in the N and C domains, respectively, most likely involved in zinc binding, and Glu-362 in the N domain and Glu-960 in the C domain are essential catalytic residues. These observations provide strong evidence that ACE possesses two independent catalytic domains and suggest that they may have different functions.", 
    "8": "Angiotensin II has previously been reported to have in vivo and in vitro cardiac hypertrophic effects. We used the salt-sensitive Dahl rat genetic strain to separate mechanical (pressure overload) vs. hormonal (renin-angiotensin system) input in cardiac hypertrophy. Blood pressure was significantly increased and left ventricular hypertrophy, as indexed by LV/BW ratios, was present at 7 and 15 days in rats receiving 4% and 8% NaCl compared to the 1% controls. There was no effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril maleate, on lowering the blood pressure in 8% NaCl-treated animals, however, there was a significant reduction in LV/BW ratio in 8% NaCl-treated animals that received this drug. Left ventricular angiotensinogen mRNA activity was significantly reduced in rats receiving 4% and 8% NaCl. In this model of hypertension the cardiac hypertrophy which develops is largely dependent on mechanical forces though there remains a significant contribution to this process from either circulating or localized angiotensin II production. Regulation of angiotensinogen gene expression in the hypertrophied left ventricle suggests that volume and electrolyte control of angiotensinogen gene expression in the heart and/or hereditary factors are predominant in the control of regulation of this gene in the left ventricle of Dahl rats.", 
    "9": "In anesthetized, artificially ventilated cats, pretreated with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, the effect of naloxone on the efficacy of nicotinic transmission in the superior cervical ganglion was used as a test of endogenous opioid release by the preganglionic axons. The cervical sympathetic trunk (CST) was split into two bundles. The compound action potential (CAP), evoked by supramaximal low-frequency stimulation (0.25 Hz) of one CST bundle, was recorded from a postganglionic nerve of the superior cervical ganglion. Partial block with hexamethonium was used to reduce the 'safety factor' of nicotinic transmission. A conditioning train (5 Hz, 40 s, supramaximal) to the other CST bundle (heterosynaptic conditioning) inhibited the CAP. At the peak of the inhibition the CAP was attenuated by 51 +/- 4%. Recovery was 90% complete in 201 +/- 28 s. The inhibition was antagonized in a dose-dependent manner by i.v. naloxone with an apparent IC50 of 60 +/- 12 micrograms/kg. The maximum effect obtained with naloxone was an 80% decrease in the magnitude of the inhibition. Magnitude and duration of the heterosynaptic inhibition were related to frequency, duration and intensity of the conditioning train. Naloxone-sensitive inhibition was observed with frequencies of the conditioning train as low as 0.5 Hz. A train (5 Hz, 40 s) to the postganglionic nerves produced a naloxone-insensitive depression of the orthodromic test CAP which was of smaller amplitude and duration than when the conditioning train was applied to the preganglionic axons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "Systemic vasoconstriction in chronic heart failure is due to several compensatory mechanisms with different time courses. Peripheral vasoconstriction mediated by increased sympathetic tone and activation of the plasma renin-angiotensin system may act primarily for short-term control. The effects of the vascular renin-angiotensin system, impaired flow-dependent, endothelium-mediated dilation (resulting from chronically reduced flow) and structural alterations of the vessel wall slowly emerge with time. In addition, fluid retention may contribute to increased vascular stiffness in chronic heart failure. Improved cardiac output with acute administration of vasodilators and inotropes is not immediately translated into increased blood flow to skeletal muscle, because (1) the reversal of the peripheral alterations described develops slowly over time (in fact, vasodilators and inotropes given acutely may cause redistribution of blood flow in skeletal muscle without improving oxygen availability); and (2) intrinsic abnormalities of skeletal muscle exist in chronic heart failure (e.g., due to chronic deconditioning, resulting in reduced oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle, as suggested by ultrastructural analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Drugs that interfere with the underlying compensatory mechanisms (e.g., renin-angiotensin system) without development of tolerance during long-term therapy exert beneficial effects after long-term treatment (e.g., the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are, in part, due to peripheral mechanisms--the inability of the peripheral vessels to dilate--and to improvement of peripheral oxygen extraction).", 
    "11": "Between 50 and 70% of patients with heart failure die suddenly and unexpectedly before they have deteriorated to New York Heart Association class IV symptoms. It has long been known that ventricular ectopy predicts sudden cardiac death in coronary heart disease, and this has also been shown in dilated cardiomyopathy. It is less certain whether antiarrhythmic drugs reduce this risk and improve prognosis. Supraventricular arrhythmias frequently develop in heart failure of all causes. They nearly always cause symptoms, and the establishment of atrial fibrillation may mark a permanent deterioration. Except for sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias are often occult. Hypokalemia and digitalis toxicity may have been precipitated by diuretics or interaction with antiarrhythmic drugs. In coronary heart failure, arrhythmias may be related to scar tissue or ischemia, which may also be responsible in dilated cardiomyopathy. Use of inotropes and inodilators may precipitate arrhythmias, whereas drugs that conserve energy or potassium, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prevent them. Since suppression of ventricular arrhythmias has not been shown to prevent sudden death or prolong life in patients with heart failure, it may be that such arrhythmias do not directly presage ventricular fibrillation except in so far as they are markers of a poor prognosis with a risk of sudden death. If so, such arrhythmias are most likely to be suppressed by agents that result in improvement of left ventricular function and, through that, prolongation of life.", 
    "12": "Thirty eight patients, aged between 25 and 81 years (mean age 56.9 years) with diagnosed chronic congestive heart failure of NYHA III and IV stages have been examined. The following phases of therapy have been distinguished depending on the used drugs: phase 0--digoxin in a daily dose of 0.25 mg and furosemide in a daily dose of 40-150 mg (mean value 72.4 mg) for 14 days; phase A1A2--nifedipine has been added in a daily dose of 40-80 mg (mean value 64.0 mg), lasting also for 14 days; phase B1B2--captopril (Lopirin--Squibb) has been added to the previous drugs in a daily dose of 25-150 mg (mean value 67.4 mg) in three divided portions for 28 days; phase C1C2--captopril has been withdrawn and drugs as in phase A1A2 have been administered for 14 days. Routine laboratory tests, ECG, a 24-hour ECG-records with Holter's technique, exercise ECG, chest X-ray, and 2D and M echocardiography were performed prior to and after 7 days as well as after each phase of the studies. A significant improvement in the left ventricle functioning assessed with Cubet's echo 2D has been observed in phase B1B2 in comparison with phase A1A2. These parameters have been the following: EF 42.61% vs 31.52%; CO 3.2 vs 2.9 L/min; SV 57.15 vs 44.24 mL (p < .001). Moreover, a decrease in heart volume (X-ray) from 1,145.25 mL to 1,088.25 mL, an increase in exercise tolerance (exercise ECG) in 52.6% of the patients, decrease in Lown's class in 11 out of 24 patients have been noted.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Circulating plasma concentrations of norepinephrine, renin, angiotensin and vasopressin are increased in congestive heart failure. By increasing ventricular afterload, heart failure is further worsened, which in turn--in a vicious cycle--stimulates neurohumoral vasoconstrictor mechanisms. Furthermore, because of the compensatory but excessive stimulation of the sympathomimetic system, a down-regulation and desensitization particularly of the myocardial beta 1 receptors and depletion of myocardial catecholamine occurs in chronic heart failure. These defects may be restored toward normal by interventions that attenuate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. A direct approach to modify the excessive vasoconstriction is to administer systemic vasodilator drugs, but despite favorable short-term effects, tolerance developed to most of these drugs during long-term treatment. One reason for the loss of effectiveness is the reflex activation of the sympathetic system, which increases vasoconstrictor hormone concentrations. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system can be modified effectively by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors that have shown favorable responses in patients with chronic heart failure. Beta-blocking agents interfere with endogenous sympathetic activation and have produced beneficial effects in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy. Long-term treatment is associated with up-regulation of the number of beta receptors and an improved responsiveness to catecholamines. Owing to the negative inotropic effects of beta-blocking agents, some of the patients with severe heart failure deteriorated hemodynamically and clinically. Theoretically, it should be advantageous to have a substance that combines protection against excessive beta stimulation with a mild inotropic support to prevent cardiac decompensation. This may be achieved by a selective beta 1-partial agonist like xamoterol.", 
    "14": "The aim of the study was to investigate whether oxygen causes a further decrease in pulmonary artery pressure after administration of calcium channel blocker-verapamil-or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-captopril-in the secondary pulmonary hypertension. We studied 37 patients with the secondary pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure = 56.1 mm Hg) due to mitral stenosis. After having completed hemodynamic diagnostic procedures, basal oxygen test was performed and pulmonary artery pressure was recorded at 10 min of oxygen breathing. Then, 10 mg of verapamil was injected into the pulmonary artery of 16 patients and 21 patients received 75 mg of oral captopril. At the peak of vasodilation, 30 min after verapamil and 90 min after captopril administration, pulmonary artery pressure was recorded and oxygen test was repeated. Baseline oxygen test produced a statistically significant decrease in pulmonary artery pressure. Verapamil and captopril also lowered pulmonary artery systolic and diastolic pressures. The second oxygen test did not cause a further decrease in the pulmonary artery pressure; mean pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 52.3 +/- 23.7 mm Hg, pulmonary artery diastolic pressure 22.7 +/- 10.6 mm Hg before and 49.1 +/- 23.8 mm Hg and 23.0 +/- 13.5 mm Hg, respectively after the test in verapamil group, and 47.0 +/- 15.5 mm Hg and 21.7 +/- 8.4 mm Hg before and 46.6 +/- 15.4 mm Hg, respectively in captopril subset. The results may support the thesis that vasodilating effect depends rather on the degree of pulmonary vascular changes than on the vasodilatory mechanism of particular drugs.", 
    "15": "Quinapril is a new non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The drug undergoes hepatic hydrolysis into its major active diacid metabolite, quinaprilat, and two minor inactive metabolites. On a weight basis quinaprilat is three times as potent an ACE inhibitor as quinapril. Approximately 60 percent of an oral dose of quinapril is absorbed. In contrast with captopril, the absorption of quinapril is unaffected by food. Peak serum concentrations of quinapril and quinaprilat are achieved within one and two hours, respectively. Approximately 61 percent of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine, principally as quinaprilat. The elimination half-life of quinaprilat is three hours, but is prolonged up to 11 hours in patients with renal dysfunction. Quinapril dose reduction is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of 0.50 mL/sec or less. In the elderly the elimination of quinaprilat is reduced and correlates well with renal function. In patients with cirrhosis the hydrolysis of quinapril to quinaprilat is impaired resulting in lower plasma quinaprilat concentrations and up to a two-fold increase in quinapril half-life. Quinaprilat has a strong binding capacity to tissue ACE allowing for once-daily dosing. The recommended starting dose for quinapril is 20 mg/d. The nature and incidence of adverse reactions to quinapril are similar to those of enalapril and captopril. Quinapril's antihypertensive efficacy is equal to that of captopril and enalapril. A small number of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have been treated with quinapril. Preliminary data indicate that quinapril is an equally effective therapeutic alternative to presently available ACE inhibitors in the treatment of CHF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Upon discontinuation of both drugs the white blood cell count was rapidly restored. Cases of agranulocytosis due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, mainly captopril, have been previously described. We could, however, find no single case associated with verapamil. This, and the very long exposure of the patient to verapamil, support the assumption that this life-threatening complication might have been caused by enalapril.",

To investigate the effect of an exercise training programme on antihypertensive drug requirements, 19 sedentary subjects (14 men and five women) with mild essential hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mmHg but less than 180 mmHg), aged 29-55 years, were randomly assigned to 16 weeks of moderate intensity exercise or light intensity exercise (control), and titrated on antihypertensive drug therapy (captopril and hydrochlorothiazide) until resting systolic blood pressure (sitting) of less than 140 mmHg was achieved. 2. The moderate exercise group (n = 11) followed a graded walk-jog programme to greater than 60% age-predicted maximum heart rate (HRmax), attending 45 min sessions, three times each week. The light exercise group (n = 8) followed a programme of flexibility (stretching exercises) and walking to less than 60% age-predicted HRmax, attending 45 min sessions, three times each week. 3. There was no difference between treatment groups for the level of reduction in both resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure over the 16 weeks (15.64 +/- 10.6/12.81 +/- 9.97 mmHg in the moderate intensity group and 15.31 +/- 10.9/7.7 +/- 7.1 mmHg in the light intensity group). The change in 24 h ambulatory blood pressure profile was also similar in both treatment groups. The final antihypertensive drug requirements to achieve these changes in blood pressure was not significantly different between the two treatment groups. This was despite a significant improvement in submaximal exercise performance in the moderate intensity exercise group (P less than 0.001). 4.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Together with results, variations in blood as a result of lower pressure are reported, whereas renal functions, and the glucose and electrolytic metabolism remained constant. The characteristics of the pharmacological compound, which may be used to treat any degrees of arterial hypertension, are discussed together with its utility in geriatric patients and the pharmacological synergy between the ACE-inhibitor and the diuretic agent.",

    "20": "This study examined the role of angiotensin II (ANG II), kinins, and prostaglandins in the renal hemodynamic response to captopril in Munich-Wistar rats in which plasma renin activity was elevated [18.8 +/- 3.3 ng angiotensin I (ANG I).ml-1.h-1]. Neural influences on the kidney were eliminated by renal denervation, and renal perfusion pressure (RPP) was controlled using a clamp on the aorta. Urine flow, sodium excretion, renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and cortical and papillary red blood cell (RBC) flow increased significantly after captopril (2 mg/kg iv). Glomerular and peritubular capillary pressures rose by 20%, and vasa recta capillary pressure fell by 3-4 mmHg due to significant reductions in estimated preglomerular, efferent arteriolar and renal capillary-venous vascular resistances. Infusion of ANG II (20 ng.kg-1.min-1 iv) returned RBF, GFR, and glomerular and peritubular capillary pressures to control; however, ANG II did not lower papillary RBC flow before inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Saralasin had no effect on papillary RBC flow or the response to captopril. The changes in vasa recta hemodynamics produced by captopril were blocked by a kinin antagonist. These findings indicate that ANG II exerts a vasoconstrictor influence on the renal cortical vasculature of Munich-Wistar rats; however, its effects on the medullary circulation are opposed by vasodilatory eicosanoids. They also suggest that kinins participate in the papillary RBC flow response to captopril, perhaps by reducing the outflow resistance from the vasa recta circulation.",

    "25": "The relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and proteinuria was characterized in experimental nephrosis in rats. In one group, proteinuria induced by aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) was reduced by using an 8% protein diet and adding the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril to the drinking water. Two control groups were injected with saline and PAN, respectively, and fed a 27% protein diet. The first group had significantly reduced albuminuria and a definite attenuation of tubular cell injury. There was a strong positive correlation between the number of interstitial macrophages and albuminuria. The beneficial effect was reproduced by dietary-protein restriction alone, whereas ACE inhibition alone had an insignificant effect on the degree of proteinuria. Depletion of circulating T lymphocytes in one group of nephrotic rats eliminated interstitial lymphocytes but did not affect interstitial macrophage influx. Inhibition of the in situ proliferation of resident interstitial macrophages by unilateral kidney irradiation failed to change the intensity of the macrophage infiltration. Treatment of rats with sodium maleate produced proximal tubular cell toxicity but interstitial inflammation did not develop, suggesting that the latter is not a nonspecific response to tubular injury. These studies demonstrate a strong relationship between tubulointerstitial nephritis and the severity of proteinuria in experimental nephrosis.",

We demonstrate, however, that in a clinically selected population, the prevalence of renovascular hypertension is similar in blacks and whites. We prospectively evaluated 167 hypertensive subjects who had one or more clinical features known to be associated with renovascular hypertension. All subjects had captopril-stimulated peripheral renin measurements and conventional renal arteriography. All significant renal artery stenoses (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if there was a blood pressure response to interventional therapy, according to the criteria established by the Cooperative Study of Renovascular Hypertension. Of the total group evaluated, 24% (39 of 167) had renal artery stenosis and 14% (23 of 167) had renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenosis or occlusion was found in 27% (26 of 97) of whites and 19% (13 of 67) of blacks (p = 0.27). Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed in 18% (17 of 97) of whites and 9% (6 of 67) of blacks evaluated (p = 0.25). Renovascular hypertension was associated with severe or refractory hypertension and with smoking, but there were no racial differences in these associations. Blacks with renovascular hypertension tended to have low captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity. We conclude that blacks with clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension should be evaluated with angiography. Captopril-stimulated plasma renin may not be useful in detecting blacks with renovascular hypertension, but this and other potential screening tests require further evaluation.", 
    "28": "The pathogenesis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon remains an enigma. Most evidence favors a local abnormality in the digital arteries as opposed to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The local fault may involve the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which are most important in reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction. Cooling blood vessels increase the sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, increased levels of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are present in primary Raynaud's disease, and patients show an increased sensitivity to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists on finger blood flow. Serotonin has also been implicated, but the evidence is not compelling. In secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, vasospastic attacks can often be explained by a low arterial distending pressure, a thickened vessel wall, or absence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity. Diagnosis of primary Raynaud's disease relies on a typical history and normal physical examination, laboratory studies, and nailfold capillaroscopy. Finger systolic blood pressures during local cooling with ischemia may be helpful to document vasospastic attacks but does not distinguish primary from secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. The treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is usually conservative. Pavlovian conditioning or biofeedback may be beneficial. When drug therapy is necessary, the calcium channel entry blocker nifedipine or sympatholytic agents have been shown to decrease the frequency and duration of vasospastic attacks in about two thirds of patients, although subjective improvement does not usually correlate with objective testing. Direct-acting vasodilators have not been shown to be of definite benefit. New therapies include prostaglandins, captopril, and the serotonergic antagonist ketanserin.

We examined the potential role of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), a vasoconstrictor of the renal circulation, on renal hemodynamics in female Sprague-Dawley rats with BUO of 24-hr duration. Rats with BUO had significantly higher plasma values of ADH 65.1 +/- 12.2 vs. 12.1 +/- 4.1 pg/ml), sodium (145.4 +/- 0.91 vs 138.6 +/- 1.06 mEq/liter), and osmolality (375.6 +/- 2.0 vs 310.1 +/- 3.6 mOsm/kg) than sham-operated rats. Rats with BUO pretreated with enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, before obstruction had somewhat higher, but not significantly different, plasma values for ADH (84.6 +/- 20.8 pg/ml) than rats with BUO not given enalapril. Rats with unilateral ureteral obstruction of 24-hr duration had plasma levels of ADH (8.2 +/- 1.3) not different from those in sham-operated rats. Rats with BUO pretreated with a specific antagonist of the V1-type receptor for ADH had significantly greater values for the glomerular filtration rate (2.31 +/- 0.24 vs 1.44 +/- 0.08 ml/min/kg body wt) and the effective renal plasma flow (8.95 +/- 0.71 vs 3.81 +/- 0.44 ml/min/kg body wt) and significantly lower values for mean arterial pressure (140.3 +/- 2.0 vs 159.1 +/- 5.5 mm Hg) than did BUO rats not given the antagonist. The results indicate that high levels of ADH play an important role in the decrease in the glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow observed in rats with BUO of 24 hr. The significant increase in ADH levels after BUO of 24-hr duration may be due to an increase in osmotic stimulation as a consequence of hypernatremia. Activation of the renin-angiotensin axis, known to occur after BUO or unilateral ureteral obstruction of 24-hr duration, does not appear to have a role in the increased circulating levels of ADH.", 
    "30": "Severe congestive heart failure is a fatal illness. Aggressive use of proven medical regimens, including vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prolong survival time for some patients. Those with refractory symptoms and seriously reduced left ventricular function, impaired exercise capacity, and complex or frequent ventricular arrhythmias should be considered for cardiac transplantation. Candidacy for transplantation is based on the absence of other illnesses that would limit survival or diminish the likelihood of success of the transplant. With the introduction of potent immunosuppressive agents, particularly cyclosporine (Sandimmune), survival rates after transplantation have improved to 90% at 1 year. Major problems include organ rejection, serious infection, development of coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart, and the limited donor organ supply.", 
    "31": "The use of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in infants with congestive heart failure (CHF) has been empirical owing to a lack of relevant pharmacokinetic data. To determine standard pharmacokinetic parameters for the drug in this population, we administered captopril, 1 mg/kg, orally to 10 infants aged 6.8 +/- 4.6 months. Sequential plasma unchanged and total (sum of unchanged and dimerized) captopril concentrations were determined using a high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Arterial pressure, systemic and pulmonary resistance, heart rate, and respiratory rate were all significantly decreased 1 h after the first dose of captopril. Plasma renin activity was not significantly increased. For unchanged captopril, the maximum concentration (Cmax) was 350 +/- 184 ng/ml; the time to Cmax (Tmax), 1.6 +/- 0.4 h; elimination half-life (t1/2), 3.3 +/- 3.3 h; oral clearance (Clo), 1.1 +/- 0.4 L/h/kg. For total captopril, Cmax was 1,088 +/- 621 ng/ml; Tmax, 2.7 +/- 1.1 h; t1/2, 3.4 +/- 1.0 h. Thus, we conclude that the pharmacokinetic parameters for captopril in infants with CHF are within the range reported for adults with CHF. Also, the hemodynamic changes, measured 1 h after the first dose, indicate that the acute effects of captopril in infants with CHF are beneficial.", 
    "32": "The information contents in previously published peptide sets was compared with smaller sets of peptides selected according to statistical designs. It was found that minimum analogue peptide sets (MAPS) constructed by factorial or fractional factorial designs in physiochemical properties contained substantial structure-activity information. Although five to six times smaller than the originally published peptide sets the MAPS resulted in QSAR models able to predict biological activity. The QSARs derived from a MAPS of nine dipeptides, and from a set of 58 dipeptides inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme were compared and found to be of equal strength. Furthermore, for a set of bitter tasting dipeptides it was found that an incomplete MAPS of 10 dipeptides gave just as good a model as the model based on a set of 48 dipeptides. By comparison other non-designed sets of peptides gave QSARs with poor predictive power. It was also demonstrated how MAPS centered on a lead peptide can be constructed as to specifically explore the physiochemical and biological properties in the vicinity of the lead. It was concluded that small information-rich peptide sets MAPS can be constructed on the basis of statistical designs with principal properties of amino acids as design variables.",

    "34": "Since dry cough has recently been recognized as a side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors employed in the treatment of hypertension or congestive heart failure, the incidence of dry cough in elderly patients receiving ACE inhibitors was investigated. There were 237 out-patients on either captopril, enalapril, or delapril, in August and November 1989. Questionnaires concerning dry cough and smoking were completed by 184 patients. Patients either less than 50 years of age, or with chronic pulmonary disease were excluded. The remaining 168 patients, 63 males, 105 females, with a mean age of 73 years were analyzed for the incidence of a dry cough in relation to age, sex, smoking, and type of drugs. The overall incidence of a dry cough was 21/168 (12.5%), 7/63 (11.1%) for males and 14/105 (13.3%) for females, and was less frequent with advancing age; in the 51-60 age group 4/11 (36.4%), in the 61-70 age group 5/39 (12.8%), in the 71-80 age group 9/75 (12.0%), in the 81-90 age group 3/40 (7.5%), in the 91- age group 0/3 (0%). Enalapril showed significantly higher incidence of dry cough than captopril (16/93, 17.2% vs 7/88, 8.0%, p less than 0.05). Delapril showed an incidence 4/11, 36.4%, however, 9 out of the 11 patients who were given delapril had had a history of a dry cough with captopril or enalapril, and in 4 out of these 9 patients the dry cough disappeared by replacement of captopril or enalapril by delapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "In this study, the vasodilating properties of captopril and zofenoprilat, two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors containing the sulfhydryl group, are investigated in the isolated rat heart. It is demonstrated that both compounds increase coronary flow in a dose-dependent manner. However, the mean pD2 of zofenoprilat appears to be significantly higher than the mean pD2 of captopril (4.55 +/- 0.06 and 3.35 +/- 0.02 respectively), indicating that zofenoprilat is about ten times more potent in increasing coronary flow than captopril. Possibly this difference in potency between captopril and zofenoprilat can be explained by their physicochemical properties. Since zofenoprilat is more lipophilic than captopril, its concentration in cardiac and vascular tissues at distribution equilibrium is thought to be higher than the tissue concentration of captopril, which may result in a more pronounced vasodilatory action. The precise mechanism of coronary vasodilation induced by ACE inhibitors containing the sulfhydryl group is not yet understood. Several factors have been proposed, such as stimulation of prostacyclin production. However, in this study, concomitant administration of 10(-6) mol/l acetylsalicylic acid shows no antagonism, indicating that under normoxic conditions the vasodilatory effects of captopril and zofenoprilat are independent of the production of vasodilating prostaglandins. Therefore, other factors than stimulation of prostacyclin synthesis seem to be involved, such as prevention of bradykinin breakdown and/or potentiation of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF). Furthermore, despite a marked inhibition of prostacyclin production, 10(-6) mol/l acetylsalicylic acid itself has no effect on coronary flow. These results suggest that prostacyclin does not play an important role in the regulation of coronary flow, at least in the normoxic isolated rat heart.", 
    "36": "1 We investigated the peripheral haemodynamic effects of human alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) following administration of endothelin-1 or NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), an inhibitor of nitric oxide production, in conscious, chronically-instrumented, Long Evans rats. 2 Infusion of endothelin-1 (3 nmol kg-1 h-1) caused hypertension, bradycardia and renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstrictions. Co-infusion of human alpha-CGRP (1.5 nmol kg-1 h-1) reduced the hypertension and abolished the hindquarters vasoconstriction caused by endothelin-1 but the renal and mesenteric vasoconstrictor actions of endothelin-1 were not affected. 3 Infusion of human alpha-CGRP (15 nmol kg-1 h-1) in the presence of endothelin-1 caused hypotension and hyperaemic vasodilatation in the hindquarters; the mesenteric vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin-1 were diminished, but there was only a transient reversal of the renal vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin-1. 4 Pretreatment with the non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753 (10 mg kg-1), caused slight hypotension associated with renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasodilatations, but DuP 753 did not affect responses to endothelin-1 infusion. However, under these conditions co-infusion of human alpha-CGRP (15 nmol kg-1 h-1) caused a sustained reversal of the renal vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin-1. 5 These results indicate that the failure of human alpha-CGRP to cause sustained reversal of the renal vasoconstrictor effects of endothelin-1 in the absence of DuP 753 was due to activation of the reninangiotensin system (possibly as a consequence of the hypotension). 6. In the second experiment, L-NAME (l0mgkg-1) caused renal, mesenteric and hindquarters vasoconstrictions similar to those seen in the presence of endothelin-1. However, the renal vasoconstrictor effects of L-NAME were reversed completely by human alpha-CGRP (l5nmolkg- h-1), even though the latter caused hypotension comparable to that seen in the presence of endothelin-1. These results are consistent with a lack of functional activation of the renin-angiotensin system by human alpha-CGRP in the presence of L-NAME. 7. The vasoconstrictor effects of L-NAME on the hindquarters were completely reversed by infusion of human alpha-CGRP, but hindquarters flow and vascular conductance did not rise above baseline levels. Hence these results indicate the hindquarters hyperaemic vasodilator effects of human alpha-CGRP seen in the presence of endothelin-1 were contributed to by nitric oxide-mediated mechanisms.", 
    "37": "Twenty nine patients with chronic renal failure associated with severe essential hypertension, 10 of whom being on programmed hemodialysis, were treated with captopril, a converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 21) and sectral-400, a cardioselective beta-blocker (n = 11). Blood pressure (BP) changes and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system parameters were studied by radioimmunoassay. When given in a daily dose of 25 to 100 mg for a long time, captopril provided a good and satisfactory antihypertensive effect in 9 patients; a weak or no effect was achieved in 9 and 5 patients, respectively. BP lowered by an average of 14.7%. There were 72% and 17.9% increases in active and total renin levels, respectively, and a reduction in the proportion of inactive in total renin. With sectral-400, 400-1200 mg/day, good, weak or no effects were observed in 6, 3, and 2 patients, respectively. BP decreased by an average of 13%, there were 59% and 12% reductions in active and total renin levels, respectively, whereas the content of inactive renin showed a 21% increase, suggesting a diminution of renin synthesis and activation. The initially higher plasma aldosterone levels in most patients (by an average of 4.2 times) decreased significantly by 23% with the two drugs. Thus, in severe essential hypertension it is advisable to use blockers of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with chronic renal failure, captopril is particularly indicated in those who have a high renin activity, and the hyperkinetic syndrome is an additional indicator for sectral-400 use.", 
    "38": "In 20% of cases, essential hypertension is of high renin pathogenesis which is indifferent of that of renal lesions. In these patients high blood pressure is closely related to high aldosterone generation due to elevated angiotensin II levels. Adrenal blood portalization is a possible way of abolishing secondary aldosteronism and hyperreninemia in this case. With this, 90-98% aldosterone and 20-30% renin are inactivated, which served as the basis for bilateral electrocoagulation of adrenal central veins in 13 patients with permanent and malignant arterial hypertension. The renin-dependent pattern of essential hypertension was confirmed by a positive BP response to a tested captopril dose (25 mg), the vasorenal one was ruled out on the basis of the peripheral captopril test, captopril pharmacorenography. Bilateral electrocoagulation of adrenal central veins was performed during a phlebographic examination. The manipulation proved to be successful on 11 (85%) left and 9 (70%) right adrenals. Blood pressure became lower in the first day and stable on days 4-5. There was a significant decrease in blood pressure at a year follow-up, in increased aldosterone levels, plasma renin activity with unchanged adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations. After the manipulation, 2 patients refused to take antihypertensive drugs, 11 patients received lower doses of drugs. The method for abolishing secondary aldosteronism is considered to be promising for further clinical studies. A special attention should be given to patients with diseases concomitant with essential hypertension who have no alternative to surgical treatment.", 
    "39": "Hypertension and progressive deterioration in renal function are commonly seen in heart transplant recipients treated for the long term with cyclosporine. Because angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have been associated with amelioration of renal dysfunction in some patients with hypertension and preexisting mild-moderate kidney failure, we treated nine hypertensive recipients of orthotopic heart transplants with enalapril (11 +/- 2 mg/day) and furosemide (62 +/- 15 mg/day) for 23 +/- 4 months. Most of the enalapril dose was given at bedtime, which minimized nocturnal and early morning hypertension. In addition to controlling blood pressure (154 +/- 6/100 +/- 2 mm Hg before enalapril vs 120 +/- 5/81 +/- 2 mm Hg currently; p less than 0.001 for both systolic and diastolic blood pressures by paired t test), there has been no increase in serum creatinine level over 684 +/- 102 days of follow-up (1.88 +/- 0.20 mg/dl before enalapril vs 1.81 +/- 0.17 mg/dl currently; p greater than 0.70). This is unlikely to be caused by the reduction in daily cyclosporine dose (492 +/- 60 mg/day before enalapril to 305 +/- 47 mg/day currently) because there were no significant changes in mean blood cyclosporine level (which has been maintained between 100 and 500 ng/ml). Treatment of hypertension with enalapril and a diuretic after heart transplantation may help prevent or delay the impairment of renal function often seen during prolonged cyclosporine therapy.", 
    "40": "In genetic and acquired hypertension, a structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment of the myocardium, including the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the interstitium and adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries and a medial thickening of these vessels, represents a determinant of pathological hypertrophy that leads to ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "41": "To evaluate the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in reversing this interstitial and vascular remodeling in the rat with genetic spontaneous hypertension (SHR) and established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we treated 14-week-old male SHR with oral lisinopril (average dose, 15 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to adenosine (800 micrograms/min) were examined in the isolated heart; myocardial collagen and intramural coronary artery architecture were analyzed morphometrically. In lisinopril-treated SHR compared with 14-week-old baseline or 26-week-old untreated SHR and age- and sex-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls, we found 1) a regression in LVH and normalization of blood pressure, 2) a complete regression of interstitial fibrosis, represented by a decrease of interstitial collagen volume fraction from 7.0 +/- 1.3% to 3.2 +/- 0.3% (p less than 0.025; WKY, 2.8 +/- 0.5%), 3) normalization of myocardial stiffness constant from 19.5 +/- 0.9 to 13.7 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 13.8 +/- 2.2), 4) a reversal of intramural coronary artery remodeling, including a decrease in the ratio of perivascular fibrosis to vessel lumen size from 1.4 +/- 0.2 to 0.4 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 0.6 +/- 0.1) and medial thickening from 12.3 +/- 0.6 to 7.4 +/- 0.5 microns (p less than 0.005; WKY, 7.4 +/- 0.4 microns), and 4) a restoration of coronary vasodilator response to adenosine from 12.3 +/- 0.9 to 26.0 +/- 1.4 ml/min/g (p less than 0.005; WKY, 21.8 +/- 2.2 ml/min/g). Thus, in SHR with LVH and adverse structural remodeling of the cardiac interstitium, lisinopril reversed fibrous tissue accumulation and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries and restored myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to normal.",

    "43": "The effect of chronic therapy with quinapril on the temporal progression of left ventricular failure and survival was assessed in the CHF 146 cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, which is an idiopathic model of congestive heart failure. Age-matched Golden Syrian (GS) hamsters served as normal controls. Quinapril was administered in the drinking water at average daily doses of 10.2, 112.4, and 222.4 mg/kg/day. In untreated CM hamsters, in vitro left ventricular performance progressively deteriorated with increasing age beginning at roughly 180 days. This decline in left ventricular performance was accompanied by a decrease in coronary flow and an increase in left ventricular volume. Administration of quinapril from 180 to 300 days of age prevented the decline of in vitro left ventricular contractile performance and coronary flow and also reduced the age-dependent increases in left ventricular volume. The cardioprotective effects of quinapril were observed at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. Lung angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by quinapril in GS and CM hamsters at 240 and 300 days of age at all dose levels. In contrast, significant inhibition of ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme activity was observed consistently at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day quinapril but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. In the survival protocol, CM and GS hamsters were treated with vehicle or quinapril (100 mg/kg/day) from 180 to 522 days of age. During the initial 210 days of treatment (from 180 to 390 days of age) 78.3% of the vehicle-treated CM hamsters died compared with 27.7% of quinapril-treated CM hamsters. Quinapril increased the median survival time of CM hamsters by 32.9% (112 days). It is concluded that chronic quinapril therapy exerts a significant cardioprotective effect and also increases survival.", 
    "44": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enhance contractile function of myocardium \"stunned\" by a brief episode of coronary artery occlusion, yet their mechanism(s) of action remain unresolved. In addition to possible hemodynamic effects, ACE inhibitors may stimulate the synthesis of cardioprotective prostaglandins. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors that contain a sulfhydryl group may be due in part to the ability of thiol compounds to act as nonspecific antioxidants or direct scavengers of cytotoxic oxygen-derived free radicals. To investigate this question we compared the effects of (1) the sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor zofenopril, (2) the sulfhydryl-containing stereoisomer of captopril (SQ 14,534) with essentially no ACE inhibitor properties, (3) the nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor enalaprilat, and (4) solvent alone, given at the time of reperfusion, on recovery of contractile function after 15 minutes of coronary occlusion in the anesthetized open-chest dog. Segment shortening in control animals remained depressed or \"stunned\" after reperfusion, recovering to only -5 +/- 12% of baseline preocclusion values at 3 hours after reperfusion. In contrast, all three treatment agents attenuated postischemic dysfunction: segment shortening was restored to 33 +/- 12%, 54 +/- 6%, and 83 +/- 5% of baseline values at 3 hours after reflow in dogs treated with SQ 14,534 (p less than 0.05), zofenopril (p less than 0.01), and enalaprilat (p less than 0.01), respectively (all vs control value). These improvements in segment shortening did not appear to be the result of altered oxygen supply or demand after reperfusion, inasmuch as no significant differences in systemic hemodynamic parameters or myocardial blood flow were observed among the groups. In the second phase of the study, we found that the improved contractile function associated with enalaprilat treatment could largely be reversed by infusion of the potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin: segment shortening was reduced from 69 +/- 12% at 2 hours after treatment/reperfusion to 38 +/- 12% at 2 hours after indomethacin infusion (p less than 0.01 vs 2 hours after reperfusion). Infusion of indomethacin had no effect, however, on the improved contractile function associated with zofenopril treatment. We therefore conclude that sulfhydryl- versus nonsulfhydryl-containing agents enhance contractile function of stunned myocardium by different mechanisms of action: enalaprilat attenuates postischemic dysfunction at least in part by a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism, whereas the salutary effects of zofenopril and SQ 14,534 may be due in part to the antioxidant properties of the sulfhydryl moiety.", 
    "45": "We investigated the long-term effects of benazepril, a new non-sulfydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and left ventricular (LV) anatomy and function in 13 never treated hypertensive patients (mean age 55 years--SD 9). Non-invasive ambulatory BP monitoring (Spacelabs 90202, a reading every 15 min for 24 hours) and standard and pulsed Doppler echocardiography were performed basally and after 12 months of therapy. Echocardiography was performed also at the end of 18th month of treatment. Eleven patients required a single daily dose of benazepril 10 (n = 9) or 20 (n = 2) mg, and two patients of 20 mg plus chlorthalidone 25 mg, to achieve clinical BP control. Average 24 h systolic/diastolic BP was 156/100 mmHg (SD 17/5) basally and 144/90 mmHg (SD 16/7) at the end of the 12th month of treatment (all p less than 0.01), LV mass index was 133 g/m2 basally and 113 g/m2 at the 12th month (p less than 0.01), early transmitral flow velocity (peak E) was 0.43 m/s (SD 0.11) basally and 0.62 (SD 0.13) m/s at the 12th month (p less than 0.01), and late transmitral flow velocity (peak A) did not change [0.67 (SD 0.10) m/s basally and 0.64 (SD 0.11) m/s at the 12th month]. Peak A/peak E ratio decreased from 1.69 (SD 0.57) to 1.31 (SD 0.37) (p less than 0.01). Peak aortic velocity, aortic acceleration time and aortic acceleration did not change. The per cent reduction of LV mass index was more closely related to the reduction of average 24 h systolic (r = 0.66, p = 0.013) and diastolic (r = 0.72, p = 0.005) BP than to the reduction of casual systolic (r = 0.37, p = NS) and diastolic (r = 0.42, p = NS) BP. None of the echocardiographic indices changed between the 12th and 18th month of treatment. In a control group of 13 age- and sex-matched healthy normotensive volunteers who underwent 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring and echocardiography twice, 12 months apart, there were no statistically significant BP or echographic changes. In summary, long-term antihypertensive treatment with benazepril provided and effective 24 h BP control, associated with regression of LV hypertrophy and improvement in LV diastolic filling, without changes in LV systolic function.", 
    "46": "1. To test the hypothesis that the reduction of left ventricular weight (LVW) observed during angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in rats is mainly a response to decreased cardiac load, the effect of enalapril on LVW and blood pressure (BP) in normotensive Sprague-Dawley (SD) and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was compared. 2. Enalapril decreased BP by 10% in SD rats and 21% in SHR; and LVW by 6% in SD rats and 12% in SHR. A close linear correlation between BP and LVW was observed in SD (r = 0.65, n = 24, P less than 0.001) and SHR (r = 0.92, n = 15, P less than 0.001). 3. The effect of enalapril on LVW, when related to BP, was almost identical in SD and SHR, as the average reduction of LVW (microgram/g of bodyweight) per mmHg was 7.7 +/- 1.9 versus 7.5 +/- 0.9 in SD and SHR respectively. 4. These data constitute additional evidence to support the view that, at least under ACE inhibition, reduction in LVW is mainly due to the fall in BP and the decreased cardiac load.", 
    "47": "The most common curable cause of high blood pressure is renovascular hypertension. Although hypertension is common in the United States, only a minority, approximately 1%, of patients have a renovascular cause. Using clinical criteria, a subgroup of these patients can be selected in which the prevalence of renovascular hypertension will be approximately 15%. In these selected patients, it is appropriate to proceed to a radiographic screening modality to look for a significant renal artery stenosis. The choice of modality should reflect the strengths and expertise of each specific institution. Hypertensive urography is no longer recommended for screening. Excellent results have been reported with intravenous DSRA in institutions where a strong interest in this procedure exists. Furthermore, intravenous DSRA is easily coupled with the collection of renal vein samples for renin assay. Intravenous DSRA, however, has not maintained widespread use. Although the radionuclide renogram is no longer adequate as a radiographic screening tool, stimulation with an ACE inhibitor, such as captopril or enalaprilat, may produce excellent results. In many institutions, this is the most appropriate examination. Furthermore, it is relatively noninvasive. Merely detecting a significant renal artery stenosis does not, however, mean the patient has renovascular hypertension. Both hypertension and a renal artery stenosis may be present and not be causally related. Because renovascular hypertension is, at least initially, renin mediated, the demonstration of increased renin production by the ipsilateral kidney should confirm renovascular hypertension. Prospective application of these results to patients undergoing revascularization techniques, however, has been disappointing. This may be related to problems in patient preparation, sample collection, renin assay, or even the physiology of chronic hypertension, which is incompletely renin mediated. Thus, offering revascularization only to those patients with lateralizing renal vein renins is not appropriate. If radiographic screening is limited to those patient at greatest likelihood for a renovascular etiology, intra-arterial DSRA or conventional arteriography may be used. These techniques most reliably detect renal artery stenosis. Their main disadvantage lies in their relatively invasive nature, as an arterial puncture is required. The poor predictive value of selective RVRRs implies that revascularization may be attempted without awaiting those results. If percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty can be performed with a satisfactorily low complication rate, both the diagnostic and the interventional procedure may be undertaken at the same setting. It is expected that further refinements in these diagnostic procedures, particularly with the use of stimulating drugs such as ACE inhibitors, will lead to further improvement in the diagnostic results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "48": "This multicenter, dose-ranging study evaluated the antihypertensive effectiveness of once-daily administration of fosinopril sodium in 220 patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg. After a 4-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy with either placebo or 10, 40, or 80 mg fosinopril once daily for 4 weeks. If treatment goals were not met, chlorthalidone 25 mg/day was added for weeks 5 to 8. Thereafter, patients could enter the long-term, open-label phase and receive 10-80 mg/day fosinopril plus chlorthalidone, if needed. After 4 weeks of monotherapy, the average decreases in supine diastolic blood pressure were 9% (10 mg), 11.5% (40 mg), and 12.5% (80 mg) compared with 6% in the placebo group. After 8 weeks, the average decreases, with or without diuretic therapy, were 12.5-18.2%, compared with 10.8% with placebo. Blood pressure continued to be well controlled, and the patients showed no evidence of tachyphylaxis or tolerance through 12-15 months of treatment. Fosinopril was well tolerated. During the short-term phase, no patient withdrew because of adverse events possibly related to fosinopril; during the long-term phase, nine of 148 patients (6.1%) withdrew for that reason. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, once-daily fosinopril (40 and 80 mg) provided significant antihypertensive effects with or without diuretic therapy. The 10 mg dose was effective in some patients and may be considered a starting dose.",

In a rat model of balloon catheterization, the proliferative response to balloon injury was reduced by 70% and the area of vascular wall covered by lesion formation was decreased by 45% in rats treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril. Other antihypertensive agents were much less active when tested for suppression of intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury: verapamil 0%, minoxidil 4% and hydralazine 34%. For cilazapril at the dose of 10 mg/kg per day, approximately 20% greater suppression of intimal hyperplasia was seen when the treatment was started 6 days before balloon injury. Treatment of rats from the time of balloon catheterization with both cilazapril (10 mg/kg per day) and heparin infusion (0.3 mg/kg per h) resulted in essentially complete (greater than 90%) inhibition of intimal hyperplasia. These data indicate that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril specifically inhibits the proliferative response to balloon injury and that heparin and cilazapril inhibit intimal hyperplasia through different mechanisms. The data also suggest that the use of pharmacologic combinations may have therapeutic usefulness to prevent late restenosis after coronary angioplasty.", 
    "50": "We present the cases of two patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema that required intubation for life-threatening airway compromise. This side effect has been previously reported with all ACE inhibitors, but its incidence and potential for a fatal outcome may not be fully appreciated. A review of the literature reveals 227 reports of this reaction with an overall incidence of approximately 0.1% to 0.2%. The etiology is nonimmunogenic and thought to be related to accentuated bradykinin activity. There is no clinical profile that identifies patients at increased risk for this side effect. There are unique clinical characteristics to this idiosyncratic reaction: angioedema may suddenly occur even though the drug has been well tolerated for months or years; symptoms may regress spontaneously while the patient continues the medication, erroneously prompting an alternative diagnosis; the pathology has a special predilection for the tongue, a circumstance that renders orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation difficult; symptoms may progress rapidly despite aggressive medical therapy, necessitating emergency airway procedures; and a rebound phenomenon following successful medical therapy has been described. We recommend intensive medical treatment before angioedema is severe enough to thwart standard methods to ensure a protected airway. Once even minor angioedema is attributed to an ACE inhibitor, an alternative class of antihypertensive medication should be chosen. Individuals with a history of idiopathic angioedema probably should not be given ACE inhibitors.", 
    "51": "This study was to search if captopril (C) reduces albuminuria in a group of type II diabetics with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Eleven type II diabetics with DN and hypertension, with albuminuria over 0.30 g/L/24th, fasten blood glucose under 250 mg/dL, serum albumin over 3 g/dL, without infection, cardiac failure or diuretic treatment, were treated with C for six months, as the only treatment for hypertension and albuminuria. Every month, albuminuria in a 24h urinary collection, medium arterial pressure (MAP), serum creatinine and fasten blood glucose were measured. Ten women and one man with 60 (50-70) years of average age (0 to 100th percentile), with 18 (8-35) years of diabetic disease, and 4 (1-7) years of clinic hypertension were studied. Before the treatment with C they had albuminuria of 6.9 (0.7 to 12.5) g/L/24h, MAP of 119.7 (93.2 to 139) mmHg, serum creatinine of 2.2 (0.7 to 7.5) mg/dL and glucose of 168 (78 to 250) mg/dL. After 6 months with C, they had albuminuria of 3.5 (0.2 to 9.6) g/L/24h (p less than 0.01), MAP of 113.4 (92.9 to 132.4) mmHg (p = 0.5), serum creatinine of 2.3 (0.5 to 6.4) mg/dL (p = 0.23) and glucose of 133 (87.5 to 239) mg/dL (p = 0.32). The MAP showed a predictive relation over albuminuria (p = less than 0.004). During the six months of study, C reduced albuminuria in type II diabetics with hypertension and diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "52": "Two non-sulfur containing ACE-inhibitors were tested concerning their local effect on experimental dermatitis in ovalbumin-sensitized guinea pigs. Enalaprilat but not cilazaprilat potentiated the ovalbumin-evoked inflammatory response. Furthermore, enalaprilat clearly enhanced the erythema evoked by substance P, whereas cilazaprilat did not. Concerning, the bradykinin-evoked erythema, enalaprilat significantly potentiated the response, whereas cilazaprilat only caused a slight increase. Our results suggest that different affinities for peptidases involved in degradation of inflammatory peptides can explain differences between the pro-inflammatory properties of enalaprilat and cilazaprilat.", 
    "53": "ACE-inhibitors have for some time been used in the treatment of hypertension. Apart from inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to II, the drugs also affect the metabolism of some inflammatory agents, like bradykinin and substance P. Egg albumin (EA)-sensitized guinea pigs were pretreated with the ACE-inhibitors. Measurement of flare and wheal areas induced by an intradermal injection of EA, showed that enalaprilat significantly increased, whereas cilazaprilat slightly decreased, the reaction area. Enalaprilat also showed an enhancement in histamine and substance P (SP) contents in the skin. In vitro incubation of guinea pig biopsies with enalaprilat potentiated EA- but not SP-induced histamine release. The EA-induced effect was abolished if the animals were pretreated with capsaicin. The conclusion is that cilazaprilat, in contrast to enalaprilat, does not potentiate inflammatory reactions in the guinea pig.", 
    "54": "We examined the possible involvement of endogenous angiotensin II (ANG II) in norepinephrine (NE) overflow and antidiuresis induced by renal nerve stimulation (RNS). RNS at a frequency of 0.5-2.0 Hz, which did not influence renal hemodynamics, produced significant reductions in urine flow and urinary excretion of sodium, and elevations in NE secretion rate (NESR) and renin secretion rate (RSR). Intrarenal arterial (i.r.a.) infusion of phentolamine (10 micrograms/kg/min) abolished the RNS-induced antidiuresis. In dogs receiving captopril (15 micrograms/kg/min i.v.), RNS-induced antidiuresis and increase in NESR were significantly attenuated. The i.r.a. administration of propranolol at 5 micrograms/kg/min, a dose that inhibited completely the RNS-induced increase in RSR, did not influence the alterations in NESR and urine formation in response to RNS. During ANG II infusion (1 ng/kg/min i.r.a.), RNS produced a reduction in urine formation and an increase in NESR, at a magnitude similar to that seen without ANG II infusion. These results suggest that RNS at a low frequency increased the NESR and RSR without affecting renal hemodynamics and that the antidiuretic effect was probably produced via the activation of postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors, but not via the ANG II receptor, located on the renal tubules. The release of NE appears to be modulated by ANG II through the activation of a facilitatory prejunctional mechanism, which is maximally stimulated by endogenously and locally generated basal levels of ANG II.", 
    "55": "The antiischemic efficacy of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) benazepril was investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study with intraindividual crossover in 11 normotensive patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease. Bicycle ergometry and 24-h ambulatory ECG were performed before and after 2-week treatment with placebo and benazepril, respectively. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were measured before each exercise test. Maximal exercise-induced ST-segment depression was not significantly influenced by benazepril therapy (placebo 2.09 +/- 1.22 mm, benazepril 1.91 +/- 1.00 mm). Systolic blood pressure/heart rate (SBP/HR) product at maximum workload remained almost constant with 253 +/- 43 with placebo and 253 +/- 39 with benazepril treatment. The number of anginal attacks and ischemic episodes detected by ambulatory ECG were not significantly reduced. PRA increased significantly from 2.18 +/- 3.76 to 9.62 +/- 8.49 ng/ml/h after benazepril (p less than 0.005), whereas plasma concentrations of ANP remained unchanged (28.04 +/- 12.39 vs. 26.73 +/- 11.09 pg/ml). Therefore, measurement of ST-segment depression with exercise in 11 normotensive patients with coronary artery disease produced no evidence of an antiischemic action for the CEI benazepril 10 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) for 2 weeks, but an improvement was observed in six patients.", 
    "56": "We studied the in vivo effect of bradykinin infusion on inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) 2 weeks after myocardial infarction in pigs, based on the assumption that the antiarrhythmic effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may, apart from their angiotensin-II lowering effect, also be due to elevation of endogenous bradykinin levels. Of the six pigs with inducible VT in the control state, four were noninducible during subsequent bradykinin infusion (p less than 0.05). The ventricular effective refractory period (VERP) did not change during bradykinin infusion (from 237 +/- 37 to 239 +/- 42 ms), nor did intraventricular conduction change (filtered QRS duration was 45 +/- 17 ms before and 43 +/- 19 ms during infusion). Bradykinin caused both a significant systolic blood pressure (SBP) decrease (from 79 +/- 14 to 49 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and diastolic BP (DBP) decrease (from 41 +/- 10 to 27 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). In conclusion, exogenous bradykinin reduced the inducibility of sustained VT 2 weeks after myocardial infarction. Because refractory periods or conduction velocity were not affected, the mechanism of action might be associated with the BP decrease, which can decrease wall stress. The previously reported antiarrhythmic effect of ACE inhibitors may be due in part to elevation of endogenous bradykinin levels.", 
    "57": "We studied the effects of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the airway responses and the recovery of endogenously released substance P- and neurokinin A-like immunoreactivities (SP-LI and NKA-LI) after tracheal injection of capsaicin in isolated guinea pig lungs superfused through the trachea. Capsaicin in doses from 10(-10) to 10(-7) mol induced a dose-dependent increase in airway opening pressure and release of SP-LI and NKA-LI. Airway opening pressure changes and the recovery of SP-LI and NKA-LI were significantly greater in lungs superfused with the NEP inhibitor SCH 32615 than in control lungs. ACE inhibition with captopril did not increase the mechanical response or the recovery of SP-LI compared with lungs not receiving captopril. In lungs from guinea pigs pretreated with high doses of capsaicin 7-10 days before study, a regimen designed to deplete endogenous tachykinins, there was a significant decrease in the content and release of NKA-LI and SP-LI. There were no detectable airway effects of acute capsaicin infusion even after doses of 10(-5) mol. Because NEP is important in modulating the airway effects of endogenously released tachykinins after tracheal infusion of capsaicin, but ACE is not, it seems likely that tracheal administration of capsaicin releases tachykinins from epithelial rather than endothelial loci.", 
    "58": "Cilazapril is an orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor which lowers peripheral vascular resistance without affecting heart rate. Like enalapril and ramipril it is a prodrug, and is hydrolysed after absorption to cilazaprilat, which has a long terminal phase elimination half-life permitting once daily administration. Given once daily at doses between 2.5 and 5 mg, cilazapril reduces arterial blood pressure in patients with mild to moderate essential and renal hypertension. Patients who do not respond adequately to cilazapril monotherapy usually respond with the addition of a diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide. Preliminary data suggest that cilazapril is of comparable antihypertensive efficacy to usual therapeutic dosages of hydrochlorothiazide, slow release propranolol, nitrendipine, captopril and enalapril. In small studies cilazapril has produced sustained beneficial haemodynamic effects in patients with congestive heart failure. Cilazapril has been well tolerated and exhibits tolerability typical of ACE inhibitors as a class, including their lack of detrimental effect on glucose or lipid metabolism. Cilazapril should provide an effective alternative in the treatment of hypertension and, if preliminary data are confirmed, in congestive heart failure.", 
    "59": "The incidence of both systolic and diastolic hypertension is increased in elderly patients, therefore antihypertensive drugs are commonly used in this population. In addition to changes in blood pressure, the aging process also causes numerous changes in other physiological parameters, resulting in altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to the drugs. The dosage regimens for thiazide diuretics and amiloride must be individually titrated in the elderly patient, since the elimination of these agents decreases concurrently with decreased renal function, as indicated by compromised creatinine clearance. The initial doses of the calcium antagonists should be decreased in elderly patients, since representative compounds from all 3 chemically heterogeneous classes have been shown to have decreased clearance in these patients which appears to be primarily due to the status of hepatic function in the patient. However, with verapamil, the dosage should be further decreased in association with compromised renal function. The dosage of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be adjusted according to renal function rather than age. Lisinopril, which is primarily eliminated unchanged, is usually given in lower doses in the elderly, and doses of both captopril and enalapril may need to be reduced, depending on renal function. While there is no need to adjust the dosage regimen for the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking drugs (prazosin, terazosin), caution should be used with the beta-adrenergic blockers, particularly the hydrophilic agents, since they are renally eliminated. Labetalol may be a suitable alternative beta-blocker for the elderly patient, since its pharmacodynamic properties of decreased systemic vascular resistance without changes in heart rate or stroke volume are preferential for the elderly patient, and its pharmacokinetics are relatively unchanged in this population. Drugs that act primarily through the central nervous system, such as clonidine, methyldopa and guanfacine, require smaller doses in the presence of renal dysfunction. In contrast, guanabenz is metabolised primarily by the liver, so it would appear to be useful in elderly patients with renal dysfunction despite the lack of studies in this population. Guanadrel, an adrenergic neuron blocking drug, also requires a dosage reduction in patients with impaired renal function. In addition to the pharmacokinetic changes that occur in the elderly patient, pharmacodynamic changes may also be anticipated due to receptor modifications. Older patients have a decrease in beta-receptor sensitivity, while alpha-receptor sensitivity does not change. When designing the dosage regimen for a senior patient with hypertension, the combination of all these variables must be considered.", 
    "60": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system during anti-heart failure treatment with additional enalapril versus conventional vasodilator therapy (hydralazine + sorbitrate) and to assess whether or not enalapril can be suggested as the preferential vasodilator therapy in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Over a 2.5-year period, 120 patients (New York Heart Association II-IV, creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl) were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive enalapril or hydralazine and sorbitrate therapy in addition to optimal digitalis and diuretics administration. At the end of a one-year followup, there was a tendency for mortality to be lower in the enalapril[correction of enlapril] group (4 cases) compared to the conventional group (9 cases), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.21). Both groups showed similar increases in plasma renin activity. The plasma aldosterone level decreased significantly in the enalapril group (p less than 0.005); whereas it rose significantly in the conventional group (p less than 0.005). The plasma norepinephrine level of the enalapril group fell significantly when compared with the conventional group. Thus, enalapril therapy achieved better reduction in the activating sympathetic system (p less than 0.0001). Reduction in the anti-diuretic hormone level was also found to be highly significant in the enalapril group, whereas no difference was seen in the conventional group. Furthermore, the serum creatinine level and blood urea nitrogen remained unchanged in the conventional group; whereas both were demonstrated to be reduced significantly in the enalapril group at a 1-year follow up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "'Primary cardioprotection' has, arguably, already been shown with thiazide diuretics and probably with beta-blockers. The proven safety and efficacy of these established drugs override any theoretical or experimental considerations in favour of ACE inhibitors. It is unfortunate that, as yet, the number of hypotheses generated in support of ACE inhibitors has not been matched by large scale clinical trials employing these drugs. The first report of the clinical use of an ACE inhibitor was in 1984; it is high time comparative studies with conventional, and proven, agents were undertaken. With regard to 'secondary cardioprotection', there is overwhelming evidence in favour of the use of beta-blockers in patients with myocardial ischaemia. Indeed, we would argue that ACE inhibitors should be used with caution in such patients to avoid impairment of coronary infusion. In the patient with acute myocardial infarction, intravenous nitrates are cheap, easy to use, safe and seem to be effective (in preventing early remodelling and reducing mortality). In the subacute phase, beta-blockers improve prognosis and, according to the currently available evidence in humans, nitrates are as effective as captopril in altering late remodelling; as in the acute situation, nitrates are cheaper, simpler to use and have a track record of long-term safety. ACE inhibitors improve symptoms, exercise capacity and prognosis in chronic heart failure. In this condition, they have been a major therapeutic advance and, on the available evidence, are to be initially preferred to other vasodilators though they should be given in addition to diuretics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The enzyme's S2' site proved to be non specific to the position of the carboxylic group in the C-terminal heterocyclic part of the inhibitor molecule.

    "65": "The phosphinyl ester prodrug fosinopril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, is fully hydrolysed after oral administration to the pharmacologically active diacid, fosinoprilat. This metabolite is cleared by both hepatic and renal routes, while most other ACE inhibitors are cleared exclusively by the kidney. In the present study, after administration of multiple fixed oral doses the accumulation of the active moieties of fosinopril, enalapril and lisinopril was compared in patients with renal insufficiency. 29 patients with creatinine clearances (CLCR) less than 30 ml/min received either fosinopril 10mg (n = 9), enalapril 2.5mg (n = 10) or lisinopril 5mg (n = 10) once daily for 10 days in a nonblind (open-label) parallel study. Pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC), peak serum concentration (Cmax) and time to peak concentration (tmax), as well as renal function, blood pressure, and plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone levels, were determined on the first and last days of the study.

Resting renal and total NE spillover rate during enalaprilat infusion were similar to control values. 3. During SNP infusion at 10 micrograms/kg per min, renal NE spillover rate increased by 26% in enalaprilat-treated group and by 39% in controls, in response to falls in mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 25 and 19% respectively. 4.

    "69": "The percentage of persons in the United States over age 65--especially over 85--is increasing more rapidly than other age groups. Two thirds of people over age 65 have blood pressure higher than 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic. Isolated systolic hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg with diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg) is also highly prevalent. In a number of clinical trials, treatment of diastolic hypertension in the elderly has been shown to be beneficial, although the value of treatment of isolated systolic hypertension is not yet established. The benefit of antihypertensive therapy on the incidence of stroke and heart failure has been clearly established, but prevention of the atherosclerotic complications of high blood pressure (sudden death or myocardial infarction, for example) has not been convincingly demonstrated. Since clinical trials designed to investigate this atherosclerotic complication of hypertension have relied on stepped-care regimens (diuretics and beta blockers), the question arises whether the use of different drugs might have a better effect on prevention of myocardial infarction. The basis for this supposition includes the known adverse effects of diuretics and beta blockers on electrolytes, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, and quality of life. Hypertension treatment in the 1990s will focus on the mechanisms by which blood pressure is lowered by various antihypertensive agents, as well as individualization of drug therapy based on coexisting diseases and conditions. Emphasis will be placed on use of monotherapy whenever possible; diuretics in low doses will probably be used more frequently for second-line therapy. In recognition of their lack of adverse lipid effects and their tolerability, first-line therapy with alpha blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists will become increasingly common. The goal of antihypertensive therapy will be to extend the life expectancy of hypertensive patients to that of subjects without high blood pressure; hopefully, these new treatment approaches will bring us closer to that goal.", 
    "70": "The aging kidney undergoes hemodynamic changes characterized by reductions in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. These functional changes are associated with loss of renal mass related to changes in the intrarenal vasculature. The reduced glomerular filtration surface area and subsequent microcirculatory adaptations enhance the risk for development of renal diseases associated with systemic diseases. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis accounts for 26% of all end-stage renal disease in the United States; the median age of those affected is 67 years. Hemodynamic and structural changes observed in the essential hypertensive kidney suggest an accentuation of the physiologic aging process. Initially observed hemodynamic changes, which may be reversible with specific drug therapy, suggest that excessive production of angiotensin II plays a role. Progressive renal impairment may occur despite control of systemic hypertension. Renal protection appears to require therapeutic normalization of both systemic and glomerular capillary pressures. The latter may depend on a drug's ability to attenuate the intrarenal effects of angiotensin II on the renal microcirculation. Drug classes with renal protective potential include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists. However, long-term clinical trials are required to assess the potential advantages of specific drug therapies in preventing the development and/or progression of hypertensive arteriolar nephrosclerosis.", 
    "71": "Effective blood pressure control with traditional high-dose diuretic therapy has led to a distinct decrease in cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, but failed to achieve a satisfactory reduction of coronary complications and sudden death. The same applies also for beta blockers, although they have been shown to be effective in secondary prevention of myocardial infarction. It is suspected that conventional antihypertensive treatment has an unfavorable effect on coronary risk factors other than hypertension. For instance, thiazide-type diuretics can impair glucose tolerance and increase the potentially atherogenic serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol fraction and triglycerides. Beta blockers without partial intrinsic sympathomimetic activity increase serum triglycerides and tend to lower the potentially antiatherogenic high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Certain beta blockers may also impair glucose tolerance, particularly when they are combined with diuretics. Calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors and alpha 1-receptor blockers do not adversely affect lipoprotein or carbohydrate profiles. The latter two drug classes may even increase insulin sensitivity, and alpha 1 blockers may also slightly improve lipid metabolism. The prognostic relevance of drug-induced dyslipidemia and/or glucose intolerance awaits further clarification. In the meantime, it is of clinical interest that several of the generally available antihypertensive drugs seem to be metabolically neutral or sometimes perhaps even potentially beneficial with regard to the lipoprotein and carbohydrate metabolism.", 
    "72": "To investigate whether excessive reduction of blood pressure (BP) by antihypertensive medications correlates with myocardial infarction, especially during sleep in elderly patients, we used telemetry and cuvette dye-dilution methods to assess the direct BP and the hemodynamics of 68 inpatients with essential hypertension during wakefulness and sleep. There were 25 patients greater than or equal to 60 years old (OH-group) and 43 were less than or equal to 59 years old (YH-group). Of the OH-group, 36% showed high BP during the day, with marked decreases (minimum BP less than 110/70 mm Hg) during sleep. Average cardiac index (CI) of the OH-group was low during wakefulness and extremely low during slow-wave sleep. Changes of mean BP in the OH-group correlated with changes in total peripheral vascular resistance index (TPRI) during sleep, but this correlation was not observed in the YH-group. The antihypertensive effects on nocturnal BP of the various medications was: central adrenergic inhibitors less than or equal to beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity less than or equal to alpha (alpha beta) blockers less than or equal to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less than or equal to calcium antagonists. Because BP and CI were found to be very low and TPRI seems to play an important role in BP regulation in sleeping elderly patients, excessive antihypertensive medication may be harmful to this subgroup. However, because the effects on nocturnal BP differ among various antihypertensive treatments, further research is required on the relation between antihypertensive medication and the hemodynamics of sleeping elderly hypertensive patients.", 
    "73": "Left ventricular dysfunction can be improved with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition started 1 week after myocardial infarction or later. To see whether earlier intervention may confer greater benefit, a double-blind study was carried out in which 100 patients with Q wave myocardial infarction, but without clinical heart failure, were randomly allocated treatment with captopril 50 mg twice daily or placebo starting 24-48 h after onset of symptoms. Left ventricular volumes were measured regularly during 3 months of treatment and after a 48 h withdrawal period by means of two-dimensional echocardiography. The placebo group showed significant increases in left ventricular end-diastolic (LVEDVI) and end-systolic (LVESVI) volume indices, with the ejection fraction unchanged. By contrast, the captopril group showed a slight but not significant rise in LVEDVI and a significant reduction in LVESVI with ejection fraction increased significantly. At 3 months there was a 4.6% difference in the change in ejection fraction from baseline between the groups (p less than 0.0001). Most of the treatment benefit was evident at 1 month and there were no changes in left ventricular volumes after 48 h withdrawal of treatment at 3 months. Heart failure requiring treatment with frusemide developed in 7 patients in each group during the study period; 3 of these (1 captopril-treated, 2 placebo-treated) had to be withdrawn from the trial with severe heart failure requiring open treatment. Thus early treatment with captopril is effective in preventing the ventricular dilatation that can occur after Q wave myocardial infarction.", 
    "74": "Three cases of captopril-associated neutropenia are described, which illustrate the clinical presentation, variable predisposing factors and outcome of this rare but potentially serious adverse event. Particular risk factors of renal failure and collagen vascular disease were present in only 1 patient, while a second patient had reversible mild renal impairment. The doses of captopril used ranged from 25 mg to 50 mg 3 times a day. Two patients recovered after withdrawal of the drug but the third died of septicaemia. Captopril-associated agranulocytosis is reviewed.", 
    "75": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II, EC 3.4.15.1) was quantified in selected areas of the rat brain by 3 different methods. The enzyme activity was quantified by an enzymatic assay in homogenates of discrete brain areas with the use of the artificial substrate hippuryl-His-Leu-[14C]glycine. Binding of the specific ACE inhibitor [125I]351A was quantified after incubation of thin brain sections followed by quantitative autoradiography with comparison to [125I]standards. The antigenic sites of the enzyme were quantified by immunoautoradiography, using a polyclonal antibody to ACE in combination with [125I]protein A followed by quantitative autoradiography. There was a good correlation between the ACE activity, as determined by the quantitative enzymatic method, and both the enzyme inhibitor binding and the [125I]protein A binding, as determined by quantitative autoradiography, in brain areas and in anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland. The present data demonstrate that ACE activity and ACE binding can be quantified in discrete tissue areas with different methods in a variety of conditions and with a high degree of accuracy.", 
    "76": "The effect of peptidase inhibitors on neuropeptide release from peripheral endings of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons was studied in cerebral superior sagittal and transverse sinuses of guinea-pig. Capsaicin (1 microM)-evoked release of substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI) was increased in a concentration-dependent manner by thiorphan (0.1-10 microM). Captopril (10 microM) or a mixture of bestatin (10 microM), leupeptin (10 microM) and bacitracin (10 microM) did not affect the capsaicin-evoked SP-LI release. Thiorphan (10 microM) increased also the capsaicin-evoked release of neurokinin A-like immunoreactivity (TK-LI) and calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactivity (CGRP-LI) by 228% and 172%, respectively, while captopril (10 microM) was without effect. Thiorphan (10 microM), but not captopril (10 microM), enhanced by 239% CGRP-LI release induced by bradykinin (10 microM). In the cerebral venous vessels neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11, NEP)-like activity was 58.8 +/- 6.1 pmol/mg protein/min, while angiotensin converting enzyme-like activity was below the detection limit of the assay. A thiorphan-sensitive mechanism, putatively attributable to NEP, plays a major role in the inactivation of peptides released from or acting on capsaicin-sensitive sensory fibres of cerebral venous sinuses of guinea-pig.", 
    "77": "Angiotensin-1-converting enzyme inhibitors have an effective and established role in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure. However, a small number of such patients will subsequently develop renal insufficiency. These patients may be identified prior to, or shortly after, commencement of therapy by recognized criteria. This report describes 4 patients with congestive heart failure who developed severe renal insufficiency secondary to either enalapril or captopril therapy in the absence of any currently recognized predisposing factors. One patient died.", 
    "78": "The renin-angiotensin aldosterone system does appear to have a central role in the haemodynamic and metabolic response to declining ventricular function. Human heart failure usually occurs in the setting of preceding disease, which may itself influence the underlying activity of the system. Studies of the renin-angiotensin system after myocardial infarction are in agreement with animal models, that transient activation of the renin-angiotensin system occurs. This may be sustained if the cardiac insult is severe and especially if diuretic therapy is initiated. In those patients in whom the insult is less severe, activity of the renin-angiotensin system wanes. The finding that patients with stable untreated heart failure do not have markedly activated renin-angiotensin systems is not surprising, but correction of the plasma and extracellular volume (for instance with a diuretic) will result in reappearance of activation of these systems. Since the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, several new peptides have been discovered (atrial natriuretic peptide, endothelin etc.) that have important effects on cardiovascular function. New potential therapeutic agents with actions on neuroendocrine systems, such as the atrial peptidase inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists and renin inhibitors, are on the horizon. Such exciting new discoveries will give as much insight into the pathophysiology of heart failure as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have done.", 
    "79": "The effects of inhibiting angiotensin converting enzyme with perindopril and aldosterone with spironolactone were tested in hypertensive patients over fifty. Accordingly, 75 patients with mild hypertension aged 50 to 70 were randomly divided into three groups for a double-blind 8 week comparison of the actions of placebo, 4 to 8 mg/day perindopril, and 37.5 to 75 mg/day spironolactone. Side-effects caused one patient to withdraw from placebo and one from spironolactone treatment. Mean blood pressure rose by 2.4 mm Hg after placebo but dropped by 7.4 and 8.6 after perindopril and spironolactone (P less than .01). Placebo, perindopril, and spironolactone did not alter blood glucose or plasma potassium, but induced, respectively, variations of -0.09, 0, and +0.34 mmol/L in cholesterol (P = .04), and -0.02, -0.05, and +0.27 mmol/L in triglycerides (P less than .01). After the three treatments, changes in angiotensin converting enzyme activity averaged -1, -6, and -1 mU/mL (P less than .01), in active renin -2, +18, and +28 pg/mL (P less than .01), and in aldosterone, +15, +8, and +95 pg/mL (P less than .01). Placebo, perindopril, and spironolactone did not alter microalbuminuria, but reduced urinary kallikrein activity by 0.9, 1.8, and 5.4 mU/mmol creatinine (P = .04). Although short-term administration of spironolactone raised renin and aldosterone markedly and lipids moderately (possibly because of volume contraction), the present results show that perindopril and spironolactone are both safe and effective for treating hypertension at the age of 50 or older.", 
    "80": "Several patients with essential hypertension manifest an abnormal (greater than 30 mg/24 h) urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Since microalbuminuria is considered an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, studies are currently being undertaken to determine the effect of various antihypertensive agents on UAE, on the assumption that a reduction of UAE might result in improved prognosis in patients with essential hypertension. Twenty-four patients with essential hypertension were randomly divided into two groups of 12. The first group received 20 mg/day enalapril for 8 weeks, followed by 20 to 40 mg/day nitrendipine for 8 more weeks. The second group received nitrendipine for 8 weeks, followed by enalapril. Mean arterial pressure decreased similarly during both therapeutic regimens in the two groups of patients. In patients of group 1, UAE decreased significantly (P less than .01) from 74 +/- 7.0 to 33 +/- 5.8 mg/24 h after 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril; during the following 8 weeks of treatment with nitrendipine, UAE increased to 58 +/- 5.3 mg/24 h (P less than .02). In patients of group 2, UAE did not change during the first 8 weeks of therapy with nitrendipine despite a significant reduction in blood pressure; subsequently, after 8 weeks of therapy with enalapril, UAE decreased from 62 +/- 9.2 to 31 +/- 4.8 mg/24 h (P less than .01). This study demonstrates that enalapril but not nitrendipine may reduce UAE in patients with essential hypertension despite similar antihypertensive efficacy. The significance of microalbuminuria and the impact of the normalization of UAE on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with essential hypertension remains to be determined.", 
    "81": "The distribution of neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP; 'enkephalinase') activity was studied on tissue sections of the guinea pig trachea using a histochemical method based on the catalytic activity of the enzyme. The specificity for NEP of the histochemical reaction was verified by application of an array of peptidase inhibitors. NEP activity was most prominent on the respiratory epithelium, but occurred also in submucous glands, connective tissue of the lamina propria, perichondrium and chondrocytes. The findings suggest that NEP in the trachea is involved in various functions, cleavage of neurally released peptides being only one of them.", 
    "82": "1. The efficacy and acceptability of enalapril were assessed in a double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled cross-over study in 21 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. 2. Skin temperature was assessed by thermocouples in response to a 15 degrees C cold water challenge as an index of digital blood flow. 3. Following enalapril there were no significant changes in the number and severity of Raynaud's attacks, and no subjective benefit from treatment as measured by visual analogue scales, 5 point rating scales, and skin temperature response to cold challenge when compared with placebo. 4. Enalapril in a dose of 20 mg daily is ineffective in the management of primary Raynaud's phenomenon.", 
    "83": "1. The currently available evidence shows that thiol containing ACE inhibitors are free radical (FR) scavengers in vitro; in particular the OH. radical is effectively scavenged by these compounds. There is also good evidence that, in vivo, ACE inhibitors can preserve myocardial contractile function following a period of reversible ischaemia (by directly protecting myocytes and/or preserving coronary flow through protection of endothelial cells). These in vivo benefits are probably also due to FR scavening, mainly due to the presence of a thiol group but, also as a consequence of augmented prostanoid production. 2. Use of more relevant animal models and testing of a range of doses of ACE inhibitors might be undertaken before clinical investigation is considered. Because of its nature, however, the existence and importance of reperfusion injury in man will only be proven or disproven by pharmacological intervention. One option is to compare a thiol containing agent with absent or minimal haemodynamic effects with placebo as an adjunct to thrombolysis. This is the simplest approach. An alternative approach is to conduct a comparative study of a -SH containing ACE inhibitor and a non -SH containing ACE inhibitor given prior to thrombolysis. There are many problems with either approach. The lack of reliable measures of FR activity in man and difficulty in measuring accurately left ventricular function post-myocardial infarction means that mortality is likely to be the only reliable end-point in such a study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "Sixteen patients who had essential hypertension were stabilized on either captopril or enalapril monotherapy and had 24-hour blood pressure profiles monitored by using one of two automatic, non-invasive ambulatory systems: Spacelabs 5300 (Squibb, Princeton, NJ) or PAR Physioport II (Kardiotec, Mannheim). In four subjects (group 1), ambulatory pressures were repeated 4 to 6 weeks later using the same equipment and the same drug. In four subjects (group 2), the drug was changed (dose ratio: captopril:enalapril, 5:1) after the first measurement, but the monitoring equipment was not changed. In four subjects (group 3), the drug was constant, but the equipment was changed for the second measurement of ambulatory pressure. In four subjects (group 4), both drug and equipment were reversed after the first measurement. The results showed that both drugs (given once daily) controlled blood pressure during the 24-hour period, with no clinically significant difference between them.", 
    "85": "This open crossover study in eight hypertensive patients defined a possible additive effect of oral guanabenz and captopril and determined a safe and effective dose range. Each group of four patients received placebo followed by ascending doses (on alternate days) of either guanabenz (2, 4, 8 mg) or captopril (6.25, 12.5, 25 mg) as initial monotherapy and were subsequently crossed over to the alternate monotherapy. Guanabenz and captopril were given concomitantly in increasing doses--the highest dose for both groups being 8 mg guanabenz/25 mg captopril. When guanabenz and captopril were given concomitantly, blood pressure decreased, both from the values during placebo administration and from the lead-in values recorded before each dose. Mean supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures after combination therapy decreased significantly (P less than .05) in a dose-related manner at most evaluations. The authors conclude that guanabenz and captopril have an additive effect when administered in combination to patients with hypertension.", 
    "86": "We studied a possible relation between stroke and an enhanced susceptibility to rupture of the arterial internal elastic lamina by comparing stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats, which have a very low incidence of stroke. We quantified interruptions in the internal elastic lamina in certain arteries and studied the effect of beta-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of cross-link formation in collagen and elastic fibers, on rupture of the internal elastic lamina and on mortality in these two substrains. To eliminate any influence of higher blood pressure in the stroke-prone rats on the parameters studied, we used antihypertensive treatment to obtain equivalent blood pressures in the two substrains. Results showed that stroke sensitivity was associated with an enhanced early spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the caudal artery, an increased susceptibility to beta-aminopropionitrile-induced rupture of the internal elastic lamina, and earlier mortality, mainly from aortic rupture, under beta-aminopropionitrile treatment. These findings suggest that stroke-prone rats have an enhanced minor connective tissue defect that is expressed by rupture of the internal elastic lamina and may be related, at least in part, to their greater vascular fragility and increased susceptibility to stroke.", 
    "87": "In recent years, studies of the regulation of the airways have focused to an increasing degree on the roles of neuropeptides. Several peptides have been shown to be present in airways and mediate such diverse responses as ion transport, mucus secretion, bronchospasm or relaxation, edema, cough, changes in vascular permeability, and neutrophil chemotaxis. More recently, studies have described the roles of peptidases, most notably neutral endopeptidase (NEP, also known as enkephalinase, or E.C. 3.4.24.11) and kininase II (also known as angiotensin-converting enzyme, or E.C. 3.4.15.1) in modulating peptide-induced responses. The enzymes cleave a wide variety of peptides, generating metabolites that are inactive in the systems studied to date. Thus inhibitors of NEP potentiate responses to peptides that are cleaved by it. Therefore, NEP plays roles in modulating peptide-induced effects analogous to the role of acetylcholinesterase in modulating cholinergic neurotransmission. In several experimental respiratory diseases, the activity of neutral endopeptidase is decreased, resulting in increased responses to peptides. The therapeutic application of recombinant NEP protects the airways from the adverse actions of stimuli that release inflammatory peptides, and induction of the NEP gene expression by glucocorticoids suggest a possible mechanism for the action of these steroids in treating airway diseases such as asthma, chronic bronchitis, or cystic fibrosis.", 
    "88": "There is activation of the renin angiotensin system after both complicated and uncomplicated myocardial infarction. Angiotensin II increases myocardial oxygen consumption whilst reducing coronary flow and is also directly toxic to the myocardium. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce beneficial haemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes in patients with acute left ventricular failure, and may have a role in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. There is evidence to suggest that they might prevent the development of late cardiac failure by limiting the extent of post infarction ventricular dilation. Further research is necessary to define their role in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "89": "Interpretation of renin-angiotensin blockade with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is potentially confounded by their multiple effects. We used a selective renin inhibitor (enalkiren, A-64662) to explore the renal and endocrine effects of angiotensin II in healthy men. Each received 90-minute enalkiren infusions at 2-day intervals, on a low (10 mmol, 16 subjects) and high (200 mmol, 12 subjects) salt diet. Plasma renin activity, immunoreactive plasma angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations, inulin, and p-aminohippurate clearance were measured by standard methods. Plasma renin activity fell at 0.1 micrograms/kg, but the threshold for biologic effect was 256 micrograms/kg, where plasma immunoreactive angiotensin II and aldosterone concentration fell, and renal plasma flow rose (p less than 0.01). The maximal renal vascular response (+152 +/- 23 ml/min/1.73 m2) occurred at 512 micrograms/kg (p less than 0.01). Diastolic and mean blood pressure fell modestly but significantly (p less than 0.05). Responses were limited on a high salt diet. We confirm that conventional plasma renin activity measurement is misleading in humans receiving a renin inhibitor. The renal vascular response to renin inhibition in this study appeared to substantially exceed reported responses to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, perhaps reflecting a crucial and relatively inaccessible intrarenal locus.", 
    "90": "The inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme by ramipril, ramiprilat, enalapril, enalaprilat, and captopril was studied in the plasma and various tissues (lung, heart, renal cortex, renal medulla) of normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Displacement curves for [3H]ramiprilat were established on each tissue with the converting enzyme inhibitors, and their potencies were expressed as the concentration that inhibited 50% of the specific [3H]ramiprilat binding. In the plasma, lung, and heart, the order of activities was: ramiprilat greater than enalaprilat greater than captopril greater than ramipril greater than enalapril. This order was different in the kidney (cortex and medulla): ramiprilat greater than enalaprilat greater than ramipril greater than captopril greater than enalapril. For ramiprilat, enalaprilat, and captopril, there were no differences in their respective potencies between tissues or between rat strains. However, the two prodrugs ramipril and enalapril were 10-30 times more active in the kidney than in the other tissues in both groups of rats. This was due to the deesterification of the prodrugs: in the presence of an esterase inhibitor (diethyl nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 microM), the potencies of ramipril in the kidney were not different from that obtained in the lung, which was not affected by the presence of the esterase inhibitor. These results suggest that the variations in the tissue activities of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor are probably not due to differences in tissue affinities of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor but depend on the concentration of this angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor in each tissue.", 
    "91": "The purpose of the present study was to assess the inhibitory effect of DuP 753, an orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonist, on the pressor action of exogenous angiotensin I and II in healthy male volunteers.", 
    "92": "In the first study (single-dose study), eight volunteers were included in a 2-day protocol repeated four times at 1-week intervals. In each phase, a different dose of drug (2.5, 5, 10, 20, or 40 mg) or placebo was given. The peak systolic blood pressure response to a test-dose of angiotensin I was determined serially before and after oral administration of DuP 753 by continuously monitoring finger blood pressure using a photoplethysmographic method. DuP 753 reduced the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin I in a dose-dependent fashion. Three, 6, and 13 hours after the 40-mg dose, blood pressure response decreased to 31 +/- 5%, 37 +/- 6%, and 45 +/- 3% of the control values (mean +/- SEM, n = 7), respectively. In the second study, 29 volunteers were treated for 8 days with either a placebo or DuP 753 (5, 10, 20, or 40 mg p.o. q.d.) and challenged on the first, fourth, and eighth days with bolus injections of angiotensin II. Again, the inhibitory effect on the systolic blood pressure response to angiotensin II was clearly dose dependent. Six hours after 40 mg DuP 753, the systolic blood pressure response to the test-dose of angiotensin II was reduced to 37 +/- 7%, 40 +/- 4%, and 38 +/- 6% of baseline values (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) on days 1, 4, and 8, respectively. With this latter dose, there was still a blocking effect detectable 24 hours after the drug. Similar to angiotensin converting enzyme and renin inhibitors, DuP 753 induced a dose-dependent increase in plasma renin that was more pronounced on the eighth than on the first day of drug administration. In these normal volunteers, no consistent clinically significant side effects were observed. There was no evidence for an agonist effect.", 
    "93": "DuP 753 appears to be a well-tolerated, orally active, potent, and long-lasting antagonist of angiotensin II in men.", 
    "94": "Sublingual captopril (25 mg) was compared with sublingual nifedipine (10 mg) to determine their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. In nine of 10 patients who received sublingual captopril, mean (+/- SD) systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure dropped from 245 +/- 39 to 190 +/- 25 mm Hg (P less than .0025) and from 144 +/- 8 to 115 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than .001) at 50 minutes, respectively. The hypotensive effect of the drug was maintained for a mean of 4 hours. In six of nine responders to sublingual captopril, blood pressure-lowering effect was associated with a clear improvement of end-organ failure within 60 minutes. There were no side effects, including a dangerous fall in blood pressure or reflex tachycardia. Sublingual nifedipine lowered diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure in eight of 10 patients. The hypotensive effect of nifedipine was more rapid than that of captopril (10 vs 20 minutes for diastolic blood pressure and 20 vs 30 minutes for systolic blood pressure, respectively), but no difference was observed in the time or in the magnitude of peak hypotensive effect between the two treatments, nor was a difference observed in the duration of hypotensive effect. In six of eight responders to nifedipine therapy, a clear improvement of symptoms and signs of end-organ failure was observed within 60 minutes. In three patients, minor side effects were observed. We conclude that sublingual captopril effectively and safely lowers arterial blood pressure in patients with hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "95": "Early functional disturbances in nerve, retina, and lens in diabetes mellitus appear to result from a common mechanism involving increased polyol-pathway activity with an associated effect on tissue myo-inositol metabolism. We tested the role of increased polyol-pathway activity in the early glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities in experimental diabetes in rats with dietary myo-inositol supplementation or the administration of sorbinil, an aldose reductase inhibitor. Each maneuver prevented the glomerular hyperfiltration of early streptozocin-induced diabetes and reversed the hyperfiltration of established diabetes of 10 days' duration. We also found that the abnormal response to captopril in diabetic rats was improved by dietary myo-inositol supplementation or sorbinil administration. Although nonhypotensive doses of captopril lowered glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic rats on a 0.01% myo-inositol diet, GFR increased substantially after captopril infusion in diabetic rats treated with sorbinil or myo-inositol supplementation. These data suggest that normalization of tissue myo-inositol metabolism restores normal responsiveness to angiotensin II; this may contribute to the reduction in GFR with the two experimental maneuvers. We also tested the interaction between polyol-pathway activation and high dietary protein intake. Aldose reductase inhibition and dietary myo-inositol supplementation had no effect on the component of increased GFR due to 50% dietary protein intake but specifically inhibited the hyperfiltration attributable to diabetes. These results suggest that hyperglycemia acts through increased polyol-pathway activity and its effects on tissue myo-inositol metabolism to play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of the glomerular hyperfiltration characteristic of early diabetes.", 
    "96": "The beneficial effects of coronary thrombolytic therapy may be enhanced by certain adjunctive therapies. Some of these are of proven value, some appear to offer no benefit in spite of theoretical advantages, and some remain to be evaluated in clinical trials. Acetylsalicylic acid markedly enhances the mortality reduction of thrombolytic therapy and should be used routinely. There is a strong theoretical rationale for the use of heparin, but evidence for its benefit exists primarily in small angiographic trials, and convincing clinical benefit has not yet been demonstrated. Early intravenous beta-blockers were shown in the prethrombolysis era to confer modest benefit, but extensive data on their adjuvant use with thrombolysis are available from only one trial. Intravenous nitrates were demonstrated to reduce mortality in the prethrombolysis era, and are soon to be evaluated in trials employing thrombolytic therapy. The calcium channel blockers, in spite of a variety of theoretical benefits, have proved to be of no value acutely, and in the subacute setting, only diltiazem appears to confer benefit in the subgroup of patients with non-O-wave infarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are likely to be of value in survivors of acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, and benefits observed with acute use in experimental infarction are now being evaluated in clinical trials.", 
    "97": "Effects of exogenous angiotensin I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) on action potential and contractile force of isolated atrial trabeculae obtained at cardiac surgery were studied by means of a standard microelectrode technique. In trabeculae driven electrically at a cycle length of 1 s, AII (8.4 nM - 8.4 microM) increased the contractile force with a peak effect occurred near 0.84 microM. The inotropic effect of AII was markedly inhibited by 1 microM saralasin or 1 microM diltiazem. AI (0.65 nM - 6.5 microM) also induced positive inotropic effect in a concentration-dependent manner. This inotropic effect was decreased significantly after 3 microM captopril pretreatment. In trabeculae active spontaneously in normal Tyrode solution, AI and AII increased significantly rate of diastolic depolarization and spontaneous discharges as well as force of contraction. These chronotropic effects were inhibited by captopril and saralasin, respectively. Captopril (0.3 nM - 3 microM) or saralasin (0.001 - 1 microM) alone also induced dose-dependent negative chronotropic effects. The present findings suggest the existence of functional AII receptors in human atrial tissues. The stimulatory effects of angiotensin appear to be related to an increase in cellular calcium.",

In an attempt to prevent nitrate tolerance, this study evaluated the interaction of nitroglycerin with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with and without a sulfhydryl group.", 
    "99": "Thirty-four subjects were randomized to a 7-day regimen of enalapril 10 mg b.i.d., captopril 25 mg t.i.d., or placebo. Venodilator response to nitroglycerin was assessed with forearm plethysmography by measuring the change in venous volume after administration of 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerin. Plethysmographic measurements were obtained serially 1) at baseline, 2) after 4 days of ACE inhibitor or placebo, 3) 2 hours after application of a 10 mg/24 hr nitroglycerin patch, and 4) 74 hours after continuous nitropatch application. ACE inhibition alone caused no significant change in the response to sublingual nitroglycerin. Nitrate response remained unchanged after 2 hours (\"acute\") of nitropatch exposure in all three groups. After 74 hours (\"chronic\") of continuous nitropatch application, the venodilator response to sublingual nitroglycerin was reduced by 40% in the placebo group, 10% in the enalapril group, and 2% in the captopril group. This attenuation was significant only in the placebo group (p less than 0.01). Pairwise comparison of nitrate response between groups was significantly different between the captopril and placebo groups (p less than 0.01) and between the placebo and enalapril groups (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin levels increased equally in the enalapril and captopril groups. Body weight increased only in the placebo group, suggesting prevention of nitrate-induced volume expansion in the ACE inhibitor groups.",

The patient was 75-year-old hypertensive male and was admitted to a hospital because of rt. hemiplegia which developed 2 weeks earlier. On admission, his blood pressure was 200/100 mmHg and serum creatinine level was 2.9 mg/dl with urinalysis 1+ both for protein and hematuria. 2 weeks later, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitor, delapril 15 mg/day) was given to control high blood pressure. Immediately after this medication, his renal failure rapidly progressed with a fall in blood pressure (110/60 mmHg) and oliguria (100 ml/day). Although he was transferred to our hospital and was treated with hemodialysis, he died of an attack of acute myocardial infarction in a week. At post-mortem examination, microscopic findings of the kidney disclosed numerous occlusions of medium-sized artery by cholesterol emboli. These emboli were also observed in other organs, but not so prominent as in the kidney. The coronary arteries exhibited severe sclerosis. In this presented case, acute deterioration of renal function was caused by ACE-inhibitor, although which was administered in a volume depleted condition. Therefore, further study would be necessary whether or not ACE-inhibitors predispose the patients with this disease to acute renal failure.", 
    "109": "Hoe 065 is a compound structurally related to the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and capable of increasing central cholinergic activity. The effects of this compound were studied on alcohol intake and on the reduction in alcohol intake produced by abutapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. Hoe 065 failed to alter alcohol intake or to modify the reduction in alcohol intake produced by abutapril. These findings suggest that enhanced cholinergic activity may not play a role in the control of alcohol consumption and may not be part of the mechanism by which the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors reduce alcohol intake.", 
    "110": "Physiological and pharmacological intervention for the purpose of determining organ functional reserve is a familiar concept in medical testing and in nuclear medicine. Nephrourologic applications include established procedures such as diuretic scintigraphy for determination of urinary outflow obstruction and captopril scintigraphy for determination of renovascular hypertension. Subtle renal dysfunction may exist among some individuals with essential hypertension, induced by provocative exercise renography, and not observed at rest. The strength of nuclear medicine resides in its ability to assess disorders of organ function for the diagnostic, prognostic, or pathophysiological information provided. Nephrourologic interventions are reviewed with an emphasis on the functional changes caused by the intervention.", 
    "111": "The purpose of this investigation was to compare the chronic effects of converting enzyme inhibition with captopril to direct blockade of angiotensin II (AII) with DuP 753 in the rat model of heart failure. Rats with chronic heart failure postinfarction were treated for 2 weeks with either captopril (2 g/L, N = 9) in their drinking water or with DuP 753 (40 mg/kg/day for two weeks by gastric gavage, N = 10), or placebo (N = 9). At this dose, DuP 753 shifted the log dose-pressor response curve to AII parallel to the right by two orders of magnitude in both chronically treated normal and heart failure rats. In rats with heart failure, DuP 753 and captopril reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 26.7 +/- 1.5 to 14.2 +/- 3.0 (P less than .01) and 15.8 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than .05), respectively, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index from 2.71 +/- 0.10 to 2.03 +/- 0.17 (P less than .05) and 2.18 +/- 0.15 (P less than .05), respectively; venous compliance increased from 2.27 +/- 0.06 to 2.80 +/- 0.18 (P less than .05) and 3.02 +/- 0.21 mL/mm Hg/kg (P less than .01), respectively. There were no significant changes in left ventricular weight/body weight ratio, mean aortic pressure, heart rate, or right atrial pressure. There was a trend, but not significant, for a reduction in total blood volume from 65.8 +/- 1.1 to 59.4 +/- 3.0 and 64.9 +/- 3.9 mL/kg, respectively. Thus, direct blockade of AII with DuP 753 or with converting enzyme inhibition with captopril produces similar hemodynamic changes in rats with heart failure after myocardial infarction.", 
    "112": "We used the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753, which lacks the agonist and kinin/prostaglandin-inducing properties of saralasin and captopril, respectively, to examine the role of endogenous angiotensin II in regulating transport in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) and whole kidney. During in vivo microperfusion in the Munich-Wistar rat, a maximally effective dose of DuP 753 (10 mg/kg, intravenously) powerfully inhibited absorption of bicarbonate (370 +/- 3 to 200 +/- 9 pEq/mm.min, P less than .001), chloride (214 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 9 pEq/mm.min, P less than .001), and water 5.2 +/- 0.1 to 2.8 +/- 0.2 nL/mm.min, P less than .001) in the S1 subsegment of the PCT. DuP 753 was significantly more effective than captopril (3 mg/kg, intravenously) in inhibiting sodium chloride transport and is the most potent diuretic ever described in this segment. Consistent with the axial decline of angiotensin II receptor density in the PCT, DuP 753 was a less effective transport inhibitor in the S2 subsegment of the PCT, similar to captopril. Using free-flow micropuncture and clearance techniques, though inhibition in the earliest segment of the nephron is partially compensated by downstream reabsorption, DuP 753 induces a substantial diuresis, natriuresis, and chloruresis. In conclusion, DuP 753 markedly decreases S1 PCT fluid and electrolyte absorption, indicating that endogenous angiotensin II exerts significant tonic support of proximal transport in vivo.", 
    "113": "Perfusion of substrate via only the hepatic artery with simultaneous substrate-free perfusion of portal vein or hepatic vein [hepatic artery portal vein-hepatic artery hepatic vein] was used to examine the enzymic distribution of carboxylesterases towards the hydrolysis of enalapril to enalaprilat in the perfused rat liver preparation. In this single-pass method, [14C]enalapril was delivered by the hepatic artery at 2 ml/min into the liver, whereas drug-free perfusate entered the portal vein or hepatic vein at 10 ml/min for HAPV and HAHV perfusions, respectively. During steady state, a multiple indicator dose of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells (vascular marker), [58Co]EDTA (interstitial space marker, which behaves similarly to labeled tracer sucrose), and 3H2O was given into the hepatic artery. Labeled enalapril and the reference indicators entering via the hepatic artery will reach virtually all sinusoidal spaces during HAPV, and will be confined to the peripheral region during HAHV. By defining the steady-state extraction ratios of enalapril (Etot) and segregating the components of biliary excretion and metabolism, and by assessing the intracellular water spaces and the corresponding transit times during HPAV and HAHV, the metabolic sequestration rate constant (metabolic intrinsic clearance per unit accessible cell water space) for the periportal region/whole liver (HAHV/HAPV) was 0.344. The data suggest that the carboxylesterase activity for enalapril conversion to enalaprilat is primarily localized in the perihepatic venous region of the rat liver.", 
    "114": "This study was conducted to examine the role of bradykinin in the persistence of the renal vasodilator effect of captopril during angiotensin II receptor blockade. Blood pressure and renal blood flow were monitored in eight groups of pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbits. In group 4, captopril alone was administered, and it decreased blood pressure by 14 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 21 +/- 4 ml/min. After a bolus injection and a constant intravenous infusion of the imidazole derivative angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 (group 5), captopril decreased blood pressure by 9 +/- 2 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 8 +/- 1 ml/min (12 +/- 1% change in renal blood flow, p less than 0.05 versus group 4). In the presence of a constant intravenous infusion of saralasin (group 6), captopril decreased blood pressure by 13 +/- 5 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 7 +/- 2 ml/min (17 +/- 5% change in renal blood flow, p less than 0.05 versus group 4). These results did not differ from those in group 5. During a constant intrarenal arterial infusion of a B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist, DArg0, [Hyp3-Thi5,8-DPhe7]-bradykinin (BkA) (group 7), captopril decreased blood pressure by 14 +/- 4 mm Hg and increased renal blood flow by 10 +/- 4 ml/min. Combined administration of DuP 753 intravenously and BkA intra-arterially (group 8) eliminated the effect of captopril. In group 8, captopril caused insignificant changes in blood pressure and renal blood flow. The results indicate that DuP 753 and saralasin antagonize the renin-angiotensin system to a comparable extent in vivo. Although blockade of the latter system accounted for a significant part of the increase in renal blood flow caused by captopril, the remaining component was contributed by endogenous bradykinin.", 
    "115": "The currently accepted drug of choice for treatment of hypertensive crisis is sublingual nifedipine. We compared the effects of sublingual captopril (25 mg) to those of nifedipine (10 mg) in 54 patients with this complication who came to the emergency room. Five min after administration of captopril, blood pressure decreased from 197.5 +/- 32.7/118.3 +/- 8.2 to 156 +/- 27.2/95.8 +/- 12.9 mmHg and heart rate decreased from 87.9 +/- 15.1 to 74.7 +/- 10.9 (p < 0.05). Blood pressure in the nifedipine group decreased from 198 +/- 27.3/120 +/- 9.8 to 147.7 +/- 17.8/86 +/- 17.9 (p < 0.05), while no change was observed in heart rate. Delayed measurements showed lower diastolic pressures at 60 and 75 min and lower systolic pressure at 120 min in the nifedipine group (p < 0.054). Few and not significantly different side effects were observed with both drugs. Thus, sublingual captopril is useful for treatment of hypertensive crisis.", 
    "116": "Aim of this study was to evaluate if captopril treatment may directly alter the trial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration. Six patients (2 male and 4 female) aged 53 +/- 11 years, with mitral stenosis, and atrial fibrillation, underwent cardiac catheterization in our Institution. The following parameters were evaluated: heart rate, right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, aortic and pulmonary pressure, cardiac index, pulmonary and systemic resistances and ANF concentration in coronary sinus, pulmonary, artery, aorta, peripheral vein. All these parameters were measured before and 30 and 60 min after captopril administration (50 mg orally). No hemodynamic changes occurred after captopril administration. No changes in ANF concentration occurred in comparison with baseline levels, after 30 and 60 min in coronary sinus (199.8 +/- 151.5 vs 181.9 +/- 102.5 fmol/ml; 178.4 +/- 95.2 vs 181.9 +/- 102.5 fmol/ml), in pulmonary artery (58.3 +/- 36.6 vs 51.4 +/- 48.8 fmol/ml; 35.5 +/- 16.9 vs 51.4 +/- 48.8 fmol/ml), in aorta (29.7 +/- 22.7 vs 37.5 +/- 26.3 fmol/ml; 25.2 +/- 9.8 vs 37.5 +/- 26.3 fmol/ml); and in peripheral vein (14.6 +/- 7.9 vs 17.3 +/- 9.7 fmol/ml; 16.2 +/- 12.2 vs 17.3 +/- 9.7 fmol/ml). In conclusion our data show that, providing no hemodynamic changes occur, captopril administration does not alter ANF concentration.", 
    "117": "In addition to inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, chronic converting enzyme inhibition may affect other blood pressure modulating factors. The influence of an 8 week treatment phase with cilazapril on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems, the pressor reactivity to infused angiotensin II or norepinephrine, the chronotropic response to isoproterenol, and body sodium and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations was assessed in 11 normal subjects and 12 patients with essential hypertension. As compared to a 4 week placebo phase, cilazapril decreased arterial pressure in both study groups (from 124/83 +/- 9/6 to 114/77 +/- 9/5 mm Hg and from 143/102 +/- 13/7 to 137/96 +/- 10/10 mm Hg; P less than .025); exchangeable sodium (-158 mmol and, respectively, -104 mmol) and upright plasma aldosterone (-24% and -15%) also tended to fall. Heart rate, the chronotropic response to posture or isoproterenol, plasma norepinephrine levels, the concentration/pressor response curve to norepinephrine, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, plasma angiotensin II and the responses of blood pressure or plasma aldosterone to angiotensin II were unchanged after 8 weeks of cilazapril. Plasma renin activity increased (+175% to +650%). These findings indicate that the blood pressure lowering effect of cilazapril in the stable phase of pharmacological intervention is not associated with modifications of sympathetic-dependent pressor reactivity or beta-adrenergic sensitivity. Plasma angiotensin II concentration and angiotensin II-dependent pathways including the pressor and aldosterone responsiveness to angiotensin II are also unchanged.", 
    "118": "Single-dose kinetics of fosinopril, a new phosphorus-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and its active diacid, fosinoprilat, were investigated in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment and in those with normal renal function. After an intravenous dose of 14C-fosinoprilat (7.5 mg), total body clearance of fosinoprilat was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in patients with normal renal function than in renally impaired patients but was not related to the degree of renal impairment in patients with creatinine clearance values of 11 to 72 ml/min/1.73 m2. Decreases in renal clearance were compensated for by increases in hepatic clearance, so that total clearance was maintained. After oral 14C-fosinopril (10 mg), plasma kinetics and bioavailability of fosinoprilat were similar for the three groups of renally impaired patients. The dual elimination of fosinoprilat by the liver and the kidney distinguishes fosinopril from other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "119": "To establish if the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy in retarding progressive diabetic renal injury is due to a specific intrarenal effect of the systemic hypotensive effect, we studied the effect of long-term ramipril treatment on blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary protein excretion in streptozotocin-diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats. The hypotensive effect of ramipril was prevented by a high salt diet, which did not alter the degree of renal angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Three weeks after uninephrectomy and induction of diabetes, rats were allocated to three groups. Groups 1 and 2 were given 1% NaCl, whereas group 3 was given water as drinking solution. One week later, groups 2 and 3 received 0.4 mg/kg/day ramipril in their drinking solution, which was continued over a 2-month period. Ramipril produced a blood pressure fall only in water-drinking rats (group 3) despite a similar reduction in plasma and renal angiotensin converting enzyme activity in groups 2 and 3. Salt-loaded rats had a progressive increase in urinary protein excretion over the duration of study. Ramipril treatment prevented an increase in protein excretion only in animals given water and with a reduced systolic blood pressure. Glomerular filtration rate was similar in all three groups. Ramipril treatment improved animal survival independently of a reduction in blood pressure or an effect on proteinuria. Although it is possible that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have specific intrarenal effects reducing progression of diabetic proteinuria, concomitant control of systemic blood pressure appears to be necessary to demonstrate a benefit.", 
    "120": "LV enlargement is an important determinant of survival after AMI. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to LV dilatation after an AMI include early thinning and stretching of the infarcted segment (e.g., infarct expansion) and hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium. Such LV dilatation may adversely affect subsequent cardiac function, leading to heart failure and death. Experimental data in animals and preliminary studies in humans have demonstrated that early administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, may limit infarct expansion and will attenuate progressive LV dilatation. This article discussed the clinical importance of the dilated left ventricle and reviewed advances and ongoing research in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the chronic phase after AMI.", 
    "121": "Immediate and short-term cardiovascular effects of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, fosinopril, were assessed in 10 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. Administration of a 10 mg oral dose of fosinopril reduced mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.001) as a result of a 24% fall in total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001). Short-term therapy (12 weeks) maintained the decrease in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05) by decreasing total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.01), without reflexive cardiac stimulation or expanding intravascular volume. Renal vascular resistance decreased (p less than 0.05) while renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction remained unchanged. The response pattern to mental, isometric and orthostatic stress was similarly unchanged. Left ventricular mass diminished by 11% (p less than 0.01); myocardial contractility was unaffected. Afterload was reduced (p less than 0.05), and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and stroke volume increased (p less than 0.05). Thus, arterial pressure reduction produced by fosinopril was associated with improved systemic and renal hemodynamics and reduced left ventricular mass.", 
    "122": "Alacepril is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that possesses sympatho-inhibitory action. We evaluated the effect of alacepril on blood pressure and progression of diabetic nephropathy in hypertensive type II diabetics in an open multicenter trial. Eighty-nine type II diabetics with mild hypertension were treated with 50 mg of alacepril daily and observed for 12 weeks. Blood pressure was reduced significantly at 4 weeks; this reduction continued throughout the study. Urinary excretion of albumin also was reduced significantly at 12 weeks. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and serum total cholesterol showed significant reduction with alacepril. We confirmed the beneficial effect of alacepril on blood pressure and diabetic nephropathy, and found that glucose and lipid metabolism improves in the diabetic state with this ACE inhibitor.", 
    "123": "The influence of alacepril (50 mg/day) on arterial blood pressure and microproteinuria in 26 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients was studied for 16 weeks. Alacepril reduced blood pressure gradually from 175/88 (standard error of mean [SEM] 2.6/1.7) to 152/81 (3.3/2.0) mm Hg (P less than .005) and albuminuria from 160.6 (SEM 29.1) to 98.1 (14.1) mg/g Cr (P less than .05), while serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, HbA1c, and fructosamine (FRA) remained stable. No significant changes occurred in the urinary beta 2 microglobulin and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase levels. As compared with the effects of a calcium antagonist (nicardipine, 60 mg/day) that reduced blood pressure from 170/92 (SEM 2.5/1.4) to 154/84 (2.5/1.5) mm Hg (P less than .001) and albuminuria from 162.2 (SEM 33.9) to 95.4 (25.0) mg/g Cr (not significant), it is suggested that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (alacepril) may have an advantageous renal effect in spite of its mild antihypertensive effect.", 
    "124": "The present study evaluated the effect of the intracerebroventricular injection of the tachykinins, substance P, neurokinin A and [Asp5.6,MePhe8]substance P(5-11) (also referred to as NH2-senktide), on the alcohol intake of genetically selected, alcohol-preferring rats. Animals were offered both water and 8% ethanol 2 h/day; tachykinins were administered just before access to fluids. Neurokinin A and substance P did not modify alcohol intake at doses up to 1000 and 2000 ng/rat, respectively. On the other hand, NH2-senktide potently suppressed alcohol intake at doses of 31.2-500 ng/rat. At the same doses, however, it did not significantly affect water intake. This finding suggests that its effect on alcohol intake might be rather selective and not due to general impairment of the behavior. Activation of tachykinin NK-3 receptors, for which NH2-senktide is a highly selective agonist, produces angiotensin II release in the brain; however, the effect of NH2-senktide on alcohol intake is probably not mediated by angiotensin II, as suggested by the fact that it is not modified by captopril pretreatment.", 
    "125": "1. Intragastric pressure (IGP) was used as an index, of the effect of serosal application of captopril (SQ 14,225; D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropanoyl-L-proline) on the contractility of rat stomach in vitro. 2. Captopril, at concentrations greater than 0.3 microM, enhanced the spontaneous gastric motility (GM) in a concentration-dependent manner whereas concentrations less than 0.3 microM selectively potentiated 4 nM bradykinin (BK)-evoked gastric contractions without significantly affecting the spontaneous GM. 3. The kallikrein inhibitor, aprotinin (100 u ml-1), markedly antagonized the enhanced GM to 1.4 microM captopril and BK (4 nM)-evoked contractions, without affecting the contractions evoked by angiotensin 1 (10 nM) and acetylcholine (0.4 microM). The angiotensin II antagonist, saralasin (50 microM) failed to mimic aprotinin. 4. The enhanced GM to captopril was markedly inhibited by tetrodotoxin (1 microM), and partially inhibited by atropine (1 microM). 5. These results indicate that in vitro, captopril (greater than 0.3 microM) enhances gastric contractility through kininase/ACE inhibitory action, presumably by increasing the concentration of undegraded tissue kinins and substance P. This motor response seems to be predominantly due to activation of the cholinergic neurones but non-cholinergic excitatory neurones are also involved.",

In six healthy men, net regional A-II balance was calculated from the transfemoral or transsplanchnic arteriovenous differences in plasma concentrations and the corresponding regional plasma flow. Systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics remained unchanged throughout the trial, indicating an absence of major hemodynamic effects during A-I infusion or concomitant ACE inhibition. In contrast, regional leg plasma flow significantly decreased following A-I infusion (165.2 +/- 15.7 vs. 304.7 +/- 43.7; p less than 0.01) and again gradually returned to about baseline values after ACE inhibition. Baseline net transfemoral A-II balance was equilibrated at slight formation rates in four subjects and at minimal extraction rates in two of the six subjects. Following A-I infusion, a shift toward net femoral A-II formation (average increase 2,774% above baseline) was observed in all subjects (p less than 0.01). After concomitant ACE inhibition, femoral A-II balance again returned to baseline levels. Across the splanchnic vascular bed a net baseline. A-II extraction was observed in all subjects. Following A-I infusion an average increase by 285% (p less than 0.05) in splanchnic A-II extraction was observed. During concomitant ACE inhibition splanchnic A-II extraction tended to decrease toward baseline values in four subjects, and remained rather unchanged in two subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "127": "The effect of captopril on steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin was studied in 12 patients with mild congestive heart failure (CHF; New York Heart Association functional class 1 or 2). Serum and urine digoxin concentrations were determined before and after a repeated administration of captopril in the patients on chronic digoxin therapy. The patients were taking digoxin, 0.25-0.375 mg/day, once daily, and were concurrently administered captopril, 37.5 mg/day, three times daily, for seven days. Peak serum concentration of digoxin (SCD) before and after captopril was 2.1 +/- 0.2, mean +/- SEM, and 2.0 +/- 0.1 ng/ml; the time to peak was 1.1 +/- 0.2 and 1.8 +/- 0.3 h; the terminal half-life (t1/2 alpha) was 10.9 +/- 1.0 and 8.7 +/- 0.9 h, and the area under the concentration-time curve to 24 h was 26.9 +/- 2.4 and 27.6 +/- 2.0 ng.h/ml. There was no significant difference between patients without and with captopril in SCD and its pharmacokinetic parameters. Renal digoxin clearance and creatinine clearance also showed no significant difference. After an administration of captopril, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) activity was well suppressed. These results suggest that captopril does not increase SCD in patients with CHF, and effectively suppresses ACE activity. Thus, modification in the dosage regimen of digoxin may be unnecessary in the case of coadministration with captopril.", 
    "128": "Congestive heart failure is a common syndrome with high mortality in its advanced stages. Current therapy includes the use of vasodilator drugs, which have been shown to prolong life. Despite current therapy, mortality remains high in patients with severe heart failure. Potent new inotropic vasodilators have improved ventricular performance but have not prolonged life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Serious arrhythmias are implicated in the sudden deaths of 30% to 40% of patients with severe heart failure, but the benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy have not been established. Upcoming trials will address this question. Ventricular remodeling and progressive dilatation after myocardial infarction commonly lead to congestive heart failure; early unloading of the ventricle with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may attenuate these events. These findings support the concept that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful in managing heart failure of all degrees of severity, including left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. Part of the damage that may occur with acute myocardial infarction, particularly in this era of thrombolysis therapy, is reperfusion injury, which may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals. Better knowledge of the mechanisms and treatment of myocardial infarction, the leading cause of congestive heart failure, may help prevent or attenuate the development of this syndrome.",

In anaesthetized intact Sprague-Dawley rats, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat, 1 mg/kg, had no significant effect on the pressor responses to the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (PE). Doxazosin 1 mg kg was found to be a potent alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist. 2. The combination of enalaprilat 1 mg/kg plus doxazosin 1 mg/kg was 3.3-fold more potent in antagonizing alpha 1-adrenoceptors than doxazosin 1 mg/kg alone. 3. After treatment of rats with deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) twice weekly for 5 weeks, the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist action of doxazosin in anaesthetized rats was not potentiated by enalaprilat 1 mg/kg. 4. Since DOCA treatment suppresses renin activity, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that angiotensin II can modulate the functional activity of alpha 1-adrenoceptor in vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "130": "The effect of exogenous angiotensin II (A II) and the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor captopril on plasma levels of neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) has been studied in the pithed guinea pig. Four periods of pre-ganglionic nerve stimulation (PNS, 8 Hz for 30s with 20 min intervals) were applied and the increases of mean arterial blood pressure (delta BP), heart rate (delta HR) and plasma NPY-LI (delta NPY-LI) in response to PNS were analysed in non-pre-treated and captopril pre-treated animals. Captopril (5 mg x kg-1 i.v.) reduced basal blood pressure and delta BP by 20% and 11%, respectively. Infusion of A II (0.5 microgram x kg-1 = min-1 i.v.) caused a significant increase in basal and PNS-induced maximal blood pressure response but reduced delta BP in captopril and non-pre-treated animals by 40% and 16%, respectively. A II elicited a long-lasting increase of basal heart rate by 12% but reduced delta HR by 36% in non-pre-treated animals. However, neither captopril alone nor A II infusion to captopril pre-treated animals significantly changed heart-rate values. The effects of exogenous A II on the cardiovascular responses were abolished by the A II-antagonist saralasin (a bolus injection, 40 micrograms x kg-1 i.v. followed by an infusion, 30 micrograms x kg-1 x min-1), which per se had no significant effect. Captopril pre-treatment reduced basal plasma NPY-LI levels by 38% and delta NPY-LI by 46% in response to PNS 1.

    "131": "To determine whether the increase in baroreflex sensitivity previously reported in lifetime captopril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was due to an inhibition of brain angiotensin II mechanisms, we tested the effect of intracerebroventricular administration of an angiotensin II receptor antagonist on baroreflex control of heart rate in lifetime captopril-treated and untreated male and female SHR. Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate was assessed by the slope of the relationship between changes in mean arterial pressure (delta MAP, mmHg) and changes in pulse interval (delta PI, ms). MAP was raised and lowered with infusions of phenylephrine and nitroprusside, respectively. Following basal assessment of baroreflex control of heart rate, rats received an intracerebroventricular injection (100 pmol) of Sar1Thr8 angiotensin II (sarthran) and reflex control of heart rate was reassessed. Adequacy of blockade was tested with central and peripheral administration of angiotensin II. Captopril-treated male (130 +/- 7 mmHg) and female (123 +/- 4 mmHg) rats had significantly lower MAP than untreated rats (174 +/- 4 and 173 +/- 8 mmHg, respectively) and enhanced bradycardia in response to increases in MAP. Intracerebroventricular administration of sarthran had no effect on basal blood pressure or heart rate but enhanced the bradycardia in response to increases in MAP in both untreated and captopril-treated rats. The increase in the slope of the line relating delta MAP to delta PT was greater for untreated than captopril-treated SHR (male untreated 2.7-fold versus captopril-treated 1.5-fold; female untreated 1.6-fold versus captopril-treated 1.5-fold).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

At pH 7.9, and in the presence of 50 mM NaCl, specific binding of [3H]ramiprilat was saturable with a dissociation constant KD = 5.05 nM and maximum number of binding sites of 1.52 pmol/mg prot. [3H]Ramiprilat binding was completely inhibited by specific inhibitors of ACE: ramiprilat, ramipril, enalaprilat, enalapril and captopril. [3H]Ramiprilat binding was Zn2(+)- and Cl(-)-dependent. In the presence of EGTA, which chelates Zn2+ ions, ramiprilat binding was inhibited, but the addition of Zn2+ restored the initial binding. Binding was maximum in the presence of 10 mM NaCl while higher NaCl concentrations decreased the binding, corresponding to a decrease in affinity. The association and dissociation kinetics were also NaCl-dependent. In the absence of NaCl, association and dissociation kinetics were rapid and monophasic. Two-step dissociation kinetics appeared in the presence of 10, 50 and 300 mM NaCl and dissociation time increased with the NaCl concentration. These results confirmed the role of Cl- in the isomerisation and the stability of the membrane-associated ACE-inhibitor complex.", 
    "133": "In 1985, an assessment of arterial hypertension treatment in insulin-treated diabetic patient gave disappointing results. In 1988, we carried out another study in order to assess the impact of new antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists) on the management of arterial hypertension and to identify patients in whom strict normal blood pressure control is mandatory. Seven hundred and fifty four patients were selected. The prevalence of arterial hypertension was 38.4 p. 100 (n = 290). Two hundred and thirty five patients (31.2 p. 100) were on antihypertensive treatment: monotherapy: 60.4 p. 100 (n = 142), bitherapy: 30.6 p. 100 (n = 72), tritherapy: 9 p. 100 (n = 21). In descending order of frequency, the following drugs were used: angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, diuretics, cardio-selective beta-blockers, central acting agents. Blood pressure values significantly decreased (148/83 mmHg, in 1988, vs 157/85 mmHg, in 1985, p less than 0.05). However, 20 p. 100 of the patients still had blood pressure values greater than or equal to 160 and/or 95 mmHg with or without antihypertensive treatment, and on average, blood pressure values remained higher in patients with antihypertensive treatment than in those without (148/83 mmHg vs 131/77 mmHg, p less than 0.001). Patients with urinary albumin excretion above or equal 30 mg/24 h compared to those with normal albuminuria had significant higher values of blood pressure, glycosylated haemoglobin and blood lipids (p less than 0.01). Only 51 p. 100 of these patients, received an antihypertensive treatment. This study emphasizes the difficulty of antihypertensive treatment in insulin-treated diabetic patients and the necessity to improve education in patients with high risk for widespread angiopathy, and particularly those with increased urinary albumin excretion.", 
    "134": "Hydrolysis of [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin was determined in whole rat plasma in vitro by using HPLC-ECD to measure Tyr, Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly formation. Although [Leu]- and [Met]enkephalin did not differ in Tyr or Tyr-Gly accumulation, the amount of Tyr-Gly-Gly resulting from [Met]enkephalin hydrolysis was greater than that resulting from [Leu]enkephalin hydrolysis, and [Met]enkephalin's half-life in plasma was slightly shorter than that of [Leu]enkephalin. By comparing metabolite formation in the presence and absence of peptidase inhibitors with high selectivity for their respective enzymes, these studies demonstrated that aminopeptidase M and angiotensin converting enzyme are the major peptidases that hydrolyze enkephalins in rat plasma.", 
    "135": "The renal responses of magnesium lithospermate B were investigated in the presence or absence of pretreatment with the converting enzyme (kininase II) inhibitor, captopril, in rats with adenine-induced renal failure. Magnesium lithospermate B (10 mg/kg body weight) caused a marked increase in the levels of the renal functional parameters (glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow and renal blood flow), accompanied by significant increases in urinary excretions of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), kallikrein, sodium and creatinine. The administration of magnesium lithospermate B in combination with captopril (2 mg/kg body weight, 2 times) caused a further increase in renal functional parameters, urinary sodium and creatinine excretions. However, the kallikrein activity was similar to the control level. There were no significant changes between urinary PGE2 following magnesium lithospermate B alone, or in combination with captopril. In addition, angiotensin converting enzyme activity did not change following the administration of magnesium lithospermate B alone, but was significantly decreased in rats given captopril, both alone and in combination with magnesium lithospermate B. The captopril administration group (captopril alone or in combination with magnesium lithospermate B) showed a significant decrease in blood pressure. From these results, it seems that the combination of magnesium lithospermate B and captopril induces a further increase in renal function by improving the renal circulatory state.", 
    "136": "In order to clarify the role of renin-angiotensin systems on arterial wall thickening in hypertension, the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, in rats with aortic coarctation was studied. Captopril was given by intragastric instillation, 3 mg/kg B, W. twice a day, since the 2nd day after the operation, and the animals were examined 4 to 6 weeks later. Blood pressures from carotid and femoral arteries were recorded directly; the heart and standardized segments of the aorta were weighted; aorta, coronary and renal arterioles were studied morphometrically; renin activity, angiotensin II and aldosterone concentrations were assayed. The results showed that captopril reduced significantly thickening of the aortic and arteriolar wall in both the hypertensive forequarters and the normotensive hindquarters. This suggests that renin-angiotensin system plays a role in the development of arterial wall thickening in hypertension.", 
    "137": "Comparative effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were assessed in rats infused chronically with synthetic endothelin. When 50 mg/kg/day of captopril orally or 6 mg/kg/day of enalapril intraperitoneally was administered simultaneously with 60 micrograms/kg/day of endothelin, the systolic blood pressure was on Day 1 142.7 +/- 5.9 mmHg (p less than 0.05) or 128.7 +/- 6.7 mmHg (p less than 0.05), respectively, compared to the rise to 163.8 +/- 4.7 mmHg when endothelin alone was infused. The antihypertensive effect of captopril or enalapril was sustained for the entire experimental period and was not associated with a significant change in urinary sodium excretion, whereas both drugs induced a significant increase in urine volume. Chronic infusion of angiotensin II intraperitoneally at a subpressor dose (400 micrograms/kg/day) reversed the antihypertensive effect of captopril in endothelin-infused rats. When 6 mg/kg/day of benidipine or 10 mg/kg/day of nilvadipine orally was administered simultaneously with 60 micrograms/kg/day of endothelin, the systolic blood pressure was on Day 1 137.0 +/- 2.4 mmHg (p less than 0.05) or 119.7 +/- 5.9 mmHg (p less than 0.05), respectively, compared to the rise when endothelin alone was infused. The antihypertensive effect of benidipine or nilvadipine was sustained for the entire experimental period and was not associated with any significant changes in urine volume and urinary sodium excretion. These results indicate that the reduced sensitivity of the peripheral arteries to endothelin may be involved in the mechanism of the hypotensive action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, dependent on the suppressed angiotensin II formation.", 
    "138": "The incidence and prevalence of cough related to enalapril was assessed by spontaneous reporting and a visual analogue scale during a 6 month random double-blind parallel-group study comparing enalapril with nifedipine. Cough was reported spontaneously by 6.2% of enalapril-treated patients, and by none on nifedipine (NS). No patient had to discontinue enalapril because of cough. After 24 weeks treatment increases in visual analogue scale scores for cough frequency greater than or equal to 8 mm were more common for enalapril than nifedipine (difference 21.5%, 95% CI 7.3-35.7%). Increased cough frequency by visual analogue scale was present throughout the study in women, but less consistently in men. High scores for cough were not related to the dose of enalapril. Cough with enalapril was not an important problem during the 6 months of treatment. However increased cough frequency could be detected by visual analogue scale, with a frequency consistent with that observed in open clinic-based studies of longer duration. These findings suggest that ACE inhibitor-induced cough may increase in severity over time, and that even a period of 6 months treatment is too short to evaluate this side-effect adequately.", 
    "139": "The relative contribution of the gut, liver, and lungs as sites of first-pass bioactivation (hydrolysis) of the orally administered ester prodrug, zofenopril calcium (SQ 26,991), to the active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, SQ 26,333, was determined. With a five-way study design, two dogs each received a single 1.6-mg/kg dose of zofenopril [as its soluble potassium salt (SQ 26,900)] via the following routes of administration: intraarterial, intravenous, intraportal, and oral. Each dog also received an equimolar oral dose of zofenopril calcium (1.5 mg/kg). Concentrations of zofenopril in plasma were quantitated with a GC/MSD assay. Extraction ratios (E) for zofenopril by the gut, liver, and lungs were calculated based on the ratios of the area under the curve (AUC) values of zofenopril in arterial plasma after administration by the various routes. As individual eliminating organs, the gut and liver each had a high intrinsic capability to hydrolyze zofenopril; E values ranged from 45 to 89%. The lungs were found to have low, but measurable, hydrolytic activity with estimated E values that ranged from 5 to 26%. Overall, about 95% of the orally administered dose of zofenopril calcium was hydrolyzed during the first pass. Because the prodrug is sequentially exposed to the gut, liver, and lungs, the contribution of the gut to the overall first-pass hydrolysis (ca. 87%) was estimated to be significantly greater than that of the liver (less than 10%) or lungs (less than 2%). Zofenopril was rapidly eliminated after parenteral administration; mean residence time values were 2 min and the elimination half-life values (intraarterial route only) were 9 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "140": "Diabetic nephropathy is the main cause of the increased morbidity and mortality in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients. Elevated blood pressure accelerates and effective blood pressure reduction with beta-blockers and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors delays the progression of nephropathy and reduces albuminuria. All previous reports dealing with the natural history of diabetic nephropathy demonstrated a cumulative death rate between 50 and 77% 10 yr after onset of nephropathy. Effective antihypertensive treatment reduced the cumulative death rate to 15-20% 10 yr after onset of nephropathy. Recent randomized control studies indicate that ACE inhibition may delay and even prevent the development of diabetic nephropathy in normotensive IDDM patients with persistent microalbuminuria. Several cross-sectional and prospective studies suggest an association between elevated blood pressure and the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, carotid insufficiency or other causes of unilaterally or bilaterally reduced retinal blood flow (pressure) diminish the development of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by abnormal leakage of fluorescein through the blood-retinal barrier, an abnormality that can be reversed during antihypertensive treatment. It is well documented that elevated blood pressure, poor metabolic control, and diabetic microangiopathy independently enhance the endothelial leakage of plasma proteins in diabetes mellitus. A link between capillary hypertension, increased extravasation of plasma proteins, and the development and progression of diabetic microangiopathy has been suggested. Blood pressure reduction diminishes the extravasation of plasma proteins. The above results strongly support the case for early and effective treatment of arterial blood pressure elevation in diabetes.", 
    "141": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been regarded as a classical hormonal system, with angiotensin II (ANG II) being the circulating effector peptide. In recent years, evidence for additional RAS in various organs, including vascular wall, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, and brain, has been obtained. Drugs interfering with the RAS such as the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors may, therefore, not only inhibit the plasma RAS but also inhibit these tissue RAS. Such a \"tissue\" RAS inhibition has been repeatedly demonstrated in animal experiments, and in some cases it correlated better with the cardiovascular actions of the CE inhibitors than did inhibition of plasma RAS. In the vascular wall, a local inhibition of ANG II synthesis may contribute not only to the reduction of vascular tone but also to the marked regression of media hypertrophy seen after CE inhibitor treatment. Vascular ANG II generation by CE appears to occur almost exclusively at the luminal surface of the endothelium. Locally formed ANG II may then contribute to the pool of circulating ANG II (endocrine ANG II) or feed back to adjacent cells without being transported by the blood (paracrine ANG II). Thus, CE inhibitors may not have to penetrate into deeper layers of the vascular wall to inhibit the vascular RAS, but may rather prevent the paracrine actions of locally generated ANG II.", 
    "142": "The systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been investigated using different experimental methods (pulsed Doppler, radioactive microspheres), either in rats (normotensive NT or genetically hypertensive SHRs) or in humans (healthy volunteers or patients with congestive heart failure CHF). All ACEIs decreased systemic vascular resistance but the profile of their peripheral vasodilating properties was heterogeneous. ACEI-induced vasodilation primarily affected the kidney in rats and in humans and this effect was accompanied by a strong and consistent increase in renal blood flow. This occurred even at non-hypotensive doses in SHRs and CHF patients and resulted in a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the kidney. In the muscular vascular bed, ACEIs also decreased local vascular resistance in rats and in humans, whether normotensive or hypertensive. In humans, this vasodilation affected both the arterioles and the large conductance vessels, more markedly in CHF patients than in normotensive subjects. Muscular blood flow was increased and a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the muscle occurred. Cerebral blood flow in SHRs and carotid blood flow in humans were augmented, whereas hepatosplanchnic blood flow was increased in rats but not modified in humans. There was no major difference between the regional vasodilating profiles of the different ACEIs, but captopril was somewhat less active at the muscular level. In conclusion, ACEI-induced regional vasodilation is heterogeneous, preferentially affecting the kidney and the muscle. In the latter, both arterioles and large conductance vessels are dilated.", 
    "143": "Food restriction or chronic converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) both limit age-related glomerulosclerosis and the associated proteinuria which occurs spontaneously in rats with renal mass ablation. Since hyperfiltration consecutive to the decreased number of nephrons may be damaging to the kidney, we investigated how fasting and CEI compare in lowering glomerular filtration rate in partially nephrectomized rats. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 3/4 nephrectomy and chronically catheterized. A week after surgery, the animals were separated into two groups, one control and one treated with the converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (1 mg/kg/24 h) for ten days. In the control untreated 3/4 nephrectomized rats, successive measurements of kidney function in the same animal showed that renal blood flow and glomerular filtration were 30 to 50% higher in fed than in fasted animals. In the group treated with perindopril, there was no longer any such difference in the renal blood flow and filtration rate. These results indicate that, by blunting postprandial hyperfiltration, chronic converting enzyme inhibition is as effective as food restriction in reducing the load delivered to the kidney.", 
    "144": "As chronic hypertension shifts the lower limit of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation to higher pressure levels, we studied the effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, perindopril on mean arterial pressure (mean BP), basal CBF, and CBF autoregulation in awake renovascular hypertensive (2 kidneys, 1 clip model) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Blood pressure was measured via a chronically implanted arterial cannula and CBF by hydrogen clearance. Chronic renovascular hypertension, like spontaneous hypertension, caused a marked shift in the lower limit of CBF autoregulation but did not alter basal CBF. In SHR, acute administration of perindopril did not diminish CBF in spite of the fact that BP fell to a level below the lower limit of CBF autoregulation (determined by hypotensive hemorrhage). Chronic treatment of renovascular hypertensive rats with perindopril normalized BP and restored CBF autoregulation.", 
    "145": "Experiments were designed to study the effects of perindoprilat (S 9780) on endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxations and contractions in isolated blood vessels. Rings of either canine femoral, basilar or left anterior descending coronary arteries, pulmonary veins, or thoracic aortas from normotensive and hypertensive rats were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension measurement. Perindoprilat did not evoke endothelium-dependent or -independent relaxations of femoral arteries, basilar arteries, coronary arteries, or rat aortas. The compound did not affect the endothelium-independent relaxations induced by isoproterenol and nitroglycerin in canine femoral arteries. However, when given to rings of canine basilar and coronary arteries, increasing concentrations of perindoprilat potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin. In addition, the drug potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and thrombin in preparations of canine left anterior descending coronary arteries. In contrast, perindoprilat did not cause changes in tension when given in the presence of either adenosine diphosphate, serotonin, or arginine-vasopressin. The compound did not modify the endothelium-dependent contractions evoked by the calcium ionophore A23187 and acetylcholine in canine basilar arteries. It also did not alter endothelium-dependent contractions to arachidonic acid or to hypoxia in canine pulmonary veins or to acetylcholine in the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "146": "During the development of hypertension in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) vascular resistance is increased, particularly in the renal circulation, and, to a lesser extent, in the splanchnic bed. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in young SHR reverses the renovascular abnormalities more effectively than simple vasodilators, suggesting that the resistance changes may depend on angiotensin II. Perindopril treatment during the development of hypertension causes a reduction in blood pressure as a result of a fall in total peripheral resistance, which persists long after treatment is stopped. These long-term effects can be prevented by replacing angiotensin during perindopril treatment. Not all organs share the long-term resistance changes following perindopril treatment, which are most marked in the renal, splanchnic, and cerebral circulations. The heterogeneous patterns of regional vascular resistance during the development and after prevention of hypertension with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in SHR suggest that local factors, for example, angiotensin II related to the tissue renin-angiotensin system or local adrenergic activity, may be important in the genesis of high blood pressure in this genetic model.", 
    "147": "Chronic renal insufficiency is a progressive, self-perpetuating process which is influenced in part by activation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system. Oral angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are being studied in animals and humans to determine whether they slow the decline in renal function characteristic of progressive renal disease. In animals that have reduced renal mass, streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus, or puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis, these agents can reduce proteinuria, decrease the frequency of sclerotic glomeruli, and normalize intrarenal hemodynamics. They also may decrease glomerular hypertrophy that occurs after renal ablation. In human trials, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors decrease proteinuria by altering the glomerular capillary permeability. The effect of these agents on progressive disease may be influenced by how soon therapy is begun and how long it is continued.", 
    "148": "Eleven patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure were studied before and three months after the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was added to their frusemide medication. The following were measured: left ventricular pressure and volume with transient occlusion of the inferior vena cava, radionuclide angiography, and hormone concentrations in plasma. As in other reported studies, the clinical condition of the patients improved and their exercise tolerance increased moderately. Addition of enalapril reduced end diastolic and systolic pressure, reduced ventricular volume, and concomitantly increased the ejection fraction. The end systolic pressure-volume relation shifted to the left as it did in a similar animal study. In the animal study unloading by a vasodilator did not induce a leftward shift, so it can be inferred that in the present study unloading combined with a decrease in the angiotensin concentration was instrumental in remodelling the heart. Though unloading was expected to have a beneficial effect on the oxygen supply/demand ratio of the heart, the patients still showed the same drop in the ejection fraction during exercise as they did before treatment with enalapril, and early diastolic filling did not improve. Normally, regression of cardiac dilatation is only found if pump function improves; the present study showed that unloading in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reshapes the ventricle without improving intrinsic pump function.", 
    "149": "Benazepril hydrochloride is a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In a multicenter study, 206 patients with mild to moderate hypertension were randomized to receive benazepril at a dose of 2, 5, 10, or 20 mg, hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg, or placebo once daily for 4 weeks. The 20 mg dosage of benazepril lowered blood pressure to a degree equal to that of 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide: -12.2/7.7 mm Hg and -13.4/-7.5 mm Hg, respectively. Hydrochlorothiazide proved to be more effective in black subjects. At lower dosage levels of benazepril (2, 5, and 10 mg), blood pressure reduction was not significantly different from that with placebo. In those patients who failed to achieve goal diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg with monotherapy after 4 weeks, the addition of open-label hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg/day) to benazepril, hydrochlorothiazide, or placebo produced a substantial additional decrease in blood pressure over a 2-week period. No definite adverse effects on hematologic measurements, serum biochemistry test results, or urinalyses were noted. Subjective adverse experiences were common in all groups but except in three or possibly four instances were not considered causally related to the study drug.", 
    "150": "In a case of neonatal hypertension, radiographic findings showed multiple thromboembolism from the ductus arteriosis diverticulum. Hypertension was well controlled by captopril during the neonatal period. The long-term follow-up of 8 years with normal cardiovascular and renal function indicates a good prognosis for acquired renovascular neonatal hypertension.", 
    "151": "It is generally agreed that moderate and severe hypertension in the elderly should be treated, but it is not clear which drug or drugs are most appropriate. Thiazide diuretics are inexpensive and effective, but they are associated with metabolic side effects that are becoming less acceptable as newer agents become available. Beta blockers are effective, but can be associated with central nervous system side effects and are often contraindicated by coexisting disease. Recently, attention has been focused on the newer agents, including calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The advantage of calcium antagonists is that they do not produce metabolic side effects. However, they are expensive and may cause vasodilatory side effects. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are effective and relatively free of side effects and may be particularly useful for elderly hypertensive patients with congestive heart failure.", 
    "152": "The subjects were 36 hypertensive patients aged 61 to 79 years (mean, 66 years). After a placebo run-in period of one month, each patient was randomly assigned to two months of treatment with 100 mg of metoprolol, 50 mg of captopril, or 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide plus 2.5 mg of amiloride daily, or placebo. The doses were doubled if diastolic pressure was above 95 mm Hg after one month of treatment. Blood pressure, heart rate, and physical fitness (endurance during a standard cycle ergometer exercise) were measured and side effects assessed after each two-month treatment period. Mean blood pressures were significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (154/92 mm Hg), captopril (157/92 mm Hg), and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (152/91 mm Hg) than after placebo (170/101 mm Hg). Heart rate was significantly lower after treatment with metoprolol (64 beats/minute) than after placebo (77 beats/minute). Exercise endurance was lower after treatment with metoprolol (498 seconds) and hydrochlorothiazide-amiloride (519 seconds) than after placebo (529 seconds) and higher after captopril (541 seconds). More patients reached the target exercise work load after captopril than after the other treatments. No patients withdrew from treatment because of side effects or abnormal laboratory test results. All three active treatments benefited the elderly hypertensive patients and did not lower their physical fitness. Captopril appeared to be more effective than the other two treatments.", 
    "153": "To determine recent changes in physicians' practices for cardiovascular disease risk reduction, a randomly selected sample of practicing primary care physicians in the upper Midwest was interviewed by telephone in 1987 and again in 1989 (response rates, greater than 90%; N = 241). The reported mean cutoff levels for labeling a total serum cholesterol level as abnormal dropped from 5.84 to 5.43 mmol/L (226 to 210 mg/dL) and for initiating medication, from 7.34 to 6.54 mmol/L (284 to 253 mg/dL). The proportion of physicians using diuretics as preferred step 1 antihypertensive agents dropped from 60% to 32%. Preferences became evenly divided among diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Advice about physical exercise changed little, but consensus among practicing physicians was high. Substantial improvements were found in smoking cessation activities. Practicing physicians are proving to be responsive to new scientific evidence and education in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "154": "The metabolic changes which accompany hyperglycemia in a person with diabetes are thought to cause renal hyperperfusion and intraglomerular hypertension, especially in the person with a predisposition to essential hypertension. Intraglomerular hypertension causing deposition of protein in the mesangium leads to glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. Screening for microalbuminuria can predict which type I diabetic patients will develop nephropathy. The decline in renal function in established diabetic nephropathy can be slowed with aggressive treatment of hypertension. The use of ACE inhibitors may also decrease intraglomerular hypertension. Whether similar treatment in the person with preclinical diabetic nephropathy would delay or prevent the onset of diabetic nephropathy is being investigated. Restricted protein intake, anti-platelet and rheolitic drugs may have a role in the treatment of established diabetic nephropathy. In end stage renal failure, renal transplantation is the treatment of choice. When transplantation cannot be performed, chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is preferable to hemodialysis.", 
    "155": "The effects of the new arterial and venous vasodilator flosequinan have been evaluated in a variety of ways in different groups of patients with chronic heart failure. Flosequinan improved the central hemodynamic effects of heart failure in one group, with benefits still apparent up to 24 hours after a single oral dose. In another group it also improved calf blood flow and, therefore, blood flow to skeletal muscle. Also, using a number of different tests, it improved the exercise performance of the patients. In a further group the improvement in exercise tolerance produced was similar to that of captopril. Flosequinan has the necessary properties of a drug that is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure.", 
    "156": "Vasodilator therapy has become a major pharmacologic approach for improving left ventricular function, and consequently, vasodilator drugs are being used increasingly in the treatment of heart failure. Ideally, vasodilator drugs used in the long-term management of heart failure should show clearly defined pharmacodynamic effects. These include reduced impedance to left ventricular ejection, increased venous capacitance, increased left ventricular ejection fraction and reduced heart size, absence of neurohormonal stimulation, and slowed progression of left ventricular dysfunction. The mechanisms of action and sites of activity of the various vasodilator drugs currently available vary considerably, and none as yet has proved ideal for the treatment of heart failure or hypertension. The complexity surrounding the multiple vasoconstrictor mechanisms involved in heart failure has led to a rationale for combined vasodilator therapy and certain combinations are discussed. From a therapeutic standpoint, the development of drugs with multiple mechanisms of action is particularly attractive. Flosequinan is a new vasodilator agent whose cellular mechanism of action remains uncertain. Flosequinan has the advantage of being able to relax both arterial and venous beds and as such may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "157": "We studied total exchangeable sodium, ion transport activity at maximal rate, and erythrocyte Na+ content in response to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in mild-to-moderate essential hypertensive patients with normal renal function. Twenty-five patients (mean age 56 years, range 40-62 years) who had abnormal red blood cell Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport or red blood cell Li(+)-Na+ countertransport were treated with either enalapril (20 mg daily) or hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg daily) during a 30-day period. During the period of enalapril treatment, Na(+)-K+ pump and Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport increased significantly from 4,282 +/- 255 to 5,236 +/- 325 mumol/l red blood cell/hr (p less than 0.01) and 166 +/- 21 to 220 +/- 24 mumol/l red blood cell/hr (p less than 0.05), respectively. Mean intracellular Na+ content in erythrocytes decreased from 11.4 +/- 0.40 to 10.0 +/- 0.33 mmol/l (p less than 0.01) and exchangeable Na+ from 39.8 +/- 0.6 mmol/kg to 35.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/kg (p less than 0.001). Sodium reduction correlated with the recovery of Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport activity (r = -0.65, p less than 0.01). During treatment, systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced significantly (p less than 0.01). In 12 patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide, Na(+)-K(+)-Cl- cotransport, Na(+)-K+ pump, Na(+)-Li+ countertransport, and Na+ permeability did not change significantly while Na+ content decreased from 11.7 +/- 0.3 to 10.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/l (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "158": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of angiotensin II (Ang II) in mediating renal responses to chronic intrarenal norepinephrine infusion. Norepinephrine was continuously infused for 5 days into the renal artery of unilaterally nephrectomized dogs at progressively higher daily infusion rates: 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, and 0.40 micrograms/kg/min. In three additional groups of dogs, norepinephrine infusion was repeated during chronic intravenous captopril administration to fix plasma Ang II concentration at 1) low levels (no Ang II infused), 2) high levels in the renal circulation (Ang II infused intrarenally at a rate of 1 ng/kg/min), and 3) high levels in the systemic circulation (Ang II infused intravenously at a rate of 5 ng/kg/min). In the control group of animals with intact renin-angiotensin systems, there were progressive increments in mean arterial pressure (from 96 +/- 4 to 141 +/- 6 mm Hg) and plasma renin activity (from 0.4 +/- 0.1 to 10.9 +/- 4.5 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr) and concomitant reductions in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow to approximately 40% of control during the 5-day norepinephrine infusion period. In marked contrast, when captopril was infused chronically without Ang II, mean arterial pressure was 20-25 mm Hg less than that under control conditions, and the renal hemodynamic effects of norepinephrine were greatly exaggerated; by day 3 of norepinephrine infusion, both glomerular filtration rate (16 +/- 2% of control) and renal plasma flow (12 +/- 4% of control) were considerably lower than values in control animals (86 +/- 4% and 80 +/- 8% of control, respectively). Similarly, when a high level of Ang II was localized in the renal circulation during captopril administration, mean arterial pressure was depressed, and again there were pronounced renal responses to norepinephrine. Conversely, when Ang II was infused intravenously during captopril administration, mean arterial pressure was not reduced, and the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow responses to norepinephrine were similar to those that occurred under control conditions. These findings indicate that the renin-angiotensin system prevents exaggerated renal vascular responses to chronic norepinephrine stimulation by preserving renal perfusion pressure.", 
    "159": "The effects of specific renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, indomethacin, and prostaglandin I2 analogue on the release of angiotensins from isolated and Krebs-Ringer-perfused rabbit mesenteric arteries were examined. Three different renin inhibitors suppressed release of angiotensins in dose-dependent manners. At the highest concentration (10(-7) M), the inhibitors EMD 52,620, EMD 54,388, and EMD 52,742 induced 46%, 52%, and 48% decreases, respectively, in the basal rate of immunoreactive angiotensin II release. These results provide clear evidence that released angiotensins are produced by the specific action of vascular renin and that the renin inhibitors suppress the vascular renin-angiotensin system as well as the circulating renin-angiotensin system and appear to provide a useful mode for the treatment of hypertension. Nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors cilazapril and delapril were more effective than captopril, and ramipril was equipotent to captopril, suggesting that the effectiveness of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors on the vascular renin-angiotensin system cannot be explained only by its inhibitory effect on angiotensin converting enzyme. Indomethacin, which was reported to suppress angiotensin II release from rat hind limbs, elicited a dose-dependent increase of angiotensin release from rabbit mesenteric arteries. These results suggest that a difference exists in the regulatory mechanisms in the release of angiotensins from diverse vascular beds.", 
    "160": "Previous studies have shown that global left ventricular function is depressed after myocardial infarction. However, little is known about the effects of myocardial infarction on contractility and the passive-elastic properties of residual myocardium.", 
    "161": "We evaluated isometric function and passive myocardial stiffness in isolated, noninfarcted left ventricular papillary muscle from rats 6 weeks after sham operation or myocardial infarction. Maximal developed tension and peak rate of tension rise (+dT/dt) were significantly decreased in untreated rats with large myocardial infarction compared with controls (3.3 +/- 1.1 versus 4.3 +/- 0.6 g/mm2 and 49.5 +/- 17.5 versus 72.5 +/- 10.5 g/mm2/sec, respectively). Time to peak tension was prolonged (120 +/- 8 versus 102 +/- 4 msec) and myocardial stiffness was increased in untreated myocardial infarction rats compared with controls (35.2 +/- 4.9 versus 24.2 +/- 3.7). Rats with smaller myocardial infarctions differed from controls only with respect to a prolongation of time to peak tension. Papillary muscle myocyte cross-sectional area was increased by 44% (p less than 0.05), and myocardial hydroxyproline content was increased by 160% (p less than 0.05) in rats with large myocardial infarctions compared with controls. To determine whether treatment that improves left ventricular function after myocardial infarction also improves myocardial function, rats were treated with captopril beginning 3 weeks after myocardial infarction and continuing for 3 weeks. Treatment with captopril attenuated the prolongation in time to peak tension in the myocardial infarction rats; however, developed tension, +dT/dt, and muscle stiffness remained abnormal. Compared with untreated myocardial infarction rats, captopril-treated myocardial infarction rats had a 9% decrease in myocyte cross-sectional area (p = 0.1) but a persistent increase in myocardial collagen content. In summary, large myocardial infarction in rats causes contractile dysfunction, increased stiffness, myocyte hypertrophy, and increased collagen content in the residual noninfarcted myocardium. Treatment with captopril alters the process of cardiac remodeling and hypertrophy and improves one parameter of contractility in noninfarcted myocardium; however, myocardial collagen content and myocardial stiffness remain abnormal.", 
    "162": "These findings suggest that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in the rat infarct model of heart failure improves global cardiac performance via combined effects on myocardial function and the peripheral circulation.", 
    "163": "Because of the known capacity of angiotensin II to serve as a growth factor in multiple tissues, we elected to study the effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibition on the growth of human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Cells were treated with captopril (0.05-5 mg/ml), enalapril, or enalaprilat (0.02-5 mg/ml) or saralasin (0.1-0.25 mg/ml). In all cases, statistically significant reductions in cell growth were seen over 5 days of culture. In additional experiments, captopril and enalaprilat significantly decreased thymidine incorporation into DNA in these cells. The administration of angiotensin II in the presence of captopril partially offset these suppressive effects.", 
    "164": "To determine whether inhibition of the brain renin-angiotensin system would affect baroreflexes similarly in old rats of different strains, we compared 24-month-old male Fischer 344 and Sprague-Dawley rats. Baroreflex sensitivity was tested while the rats were awake by recording reflex heart rate responses elicited as blood pressure was elevated with phenylephrine or lowered with sodium nitroprusside. Sprague-Dawley rats had higher blood pressures and lower heart rates initially. Chronic infusion of enalapril, a converting enzyme inhibitor, into a lateral cerebral ventricle (ICV) for two weeks lowered blood pressure in Sprague-Dawley but not in Fischer 344 rats. Furthermore, reflex bradycardia was unaffected in either rat strain, but reflex tachycardia was selectively suppressed in Fischer 344 rats. Thus, although time controls were not done to rule out spontaneous changes during the 14-day infusion period, these results suggest that central cardiovascular regulation does not change similarly with age in these two rat strains. As removal of the brain renin-angiotensin system lowered blood pressure in one strain and inhibited reflex tachycardia in the other, the divergence could mean that the brain renin-angiotensin system acts differently to keep blood pressure elevated in Sprague-Dawley rats and modulate reflex tachycardia in Fischer 344 rats.", 
    "165": "Although hypoalbuminemia is a fundamental characteristic of nephrotic syndrome (NS), there are many patients with massive proteinuria that do not develop hypoalbuminemia. We have studied the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 19 patients with persistent massive proteinuria (greater than 5 g/d) and normal serum albumin (group I) in comparison with 16 patients with similar proteinuria excretion, but persistent hypoalbuminemia (group II). Most of group I patients had diagnoses suggesting glomerular hyperfiltration (focal glomerulosclerosis [FGS] associated with vesicoureteral reflux [VUR], reduction of renal mass, proteinuria associated with obesity, sclerotic phase of idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis [GN] in contrast with those of group II, in which membranous GN was the most frequent diagnosis. We prospectively investigated differences in the antiproteinuric effect of captopril, an antiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI); after 6 months of treatment, proteinuria decreased clearly in group I (7.1 +/- 1.7 to 3.7 +/- 1.7 g/d; P less than 0.001), whereas no significant changes were observed in group II (8.1 +/- 2.4 to 8.8 +/- 4 g/d). Serum creatinine (Scr) remained stable during captopril treatment in group I, whereas three patients in group II showed a worsening of renal function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "166": "To determine whether the captopril-stimulated renal vein renin ratio (CSRVRR) could enable identification of patients with hemodynamically significant renovascular lesions who would respond to revascularization, the authors measured CSRVRRs in 143 consecutive patients with hypertension who had been selected because of clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension. All patients underwent conventional renal arteriography. Renovascular hypertension was the final diagnosis if revascularization resulted in cure or improvement in blood pressure. Complete data were available for 133 patients. Twenty patients had renovascular hypertension; CSRVRR was greater than 1.5 in 13 of these 20 patients (sensitivity, 65%). However, it was also greater than 1.5 in 54 of the 113 patients without renovascular hypertension (false-positive rate, 47.8%). The positive predictive value of CSRVRR was 18.6%; the negative predictive value, 89.3%. It is concluded that CSRVRR is not sufficiently sensitive to enable prediction of which patients will respond to revascularization and is not specific enough to exclude patients who do not have renovascular hypertension.", 
    "167": "The effects of captopril and placebo were compared in 18 patients with chronic heart failure and angina pectoris with use of a double-blind crossover trial design. Symptoms were assessed by patient treatment preference, visual analogue scores and nitroglycerin consumption. Exercise performance was assessed using two different treadmill protocols of different work intensity with simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption and by supine bicycle exercise and simultaneous radionuclide ventriculography. Arrhythmias were assessed by 48 h ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Patients generally preferred placebo to captopril, and this appeared to be due to an increase in symptoms of angina with captopril. Treadmill exercise time on a high intensity protocol was shorter with captopril than with placebo; on a low intensity protocol, angina became a more frequent limiting symptom even though overall exercise performance was not changed. The heart rate-blood pressure product was reduced, but largely because of a reduction in blood pressure rather than in heart rate. During supine bicycle exercise, no differences in symptoms, exercise performance, ejection fraction or changes in blood pressure were noted and ventricular arrhythmias were reduced. Captopril does not appear to be clinically useful in alleviating angina pectoris in patients with heart failure, and this effect may be related to a decrease in coronary perfusion pressure. Nonetheless, desirable metabolic effects, a reduction in arrhythmias and potential effects on survival require further study of captopril in patients with both angina and heart failure.", 
    "168": "Diabetic nephropathy is the most frequent cause of chronic renal insufficiency in adults. Its early stage, characterized by increased albuminuria, develops in susceptible subjects already manifestation of diabetes. This stage can be treated by inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme which reduce the pathologically elevated intraglomerular pressure even in normotonic subjects. Enalapril was administered for a period of 12 weeks to eight children and adolescents with a normal blood pressure and albuminuria of 30-300 mg/24 hours during repeated assessments. During treatment there was not only a significant decline of albuminuria (from 104.6 +/- 42.7 mg/24 hours to 47.2 +/- 15.4, p = 0.003) but also a drop of the pathological glomerular hyperfiltration (from 3.38 +/- 1.87 ml/s to 1.48 +/- 0.54 ml/s within six weeks - p = 0.02 and to 2.05 +/- 0.80 ml/s resp. within 12 weeks, n.s.). The favourable effect persisted also for some time after discontinuation of treatment. Treatment was relatively well tolerated by the patients. The problem remains whether it is possible to retard or prevent in this way the development of further stages of diabetic nephropathy, include chronic renal failure.", 
    "169": "The hypotensive side effect of four IgG preparations was studied in a rat model. An unmodified, chromatographically isolated preparation (prepn. C) appeared to induce a transient drop in blood pressure via the kininogen kinin system. A preparation made by ethanol fractionation (prepn. E) and an ethanol-fractionated, modified product (prepn. M) produced an action which does not depend on kininogen activation. No blocking of kininase was required for this effect and it was brought about by prepn. M was devoid of any sizeable prekallikrein activator or kallikrein like proteinase content. The effect was associated by the aggregate fraction of prepn. E, but not with IgG monomers of the same preparation. Animals given these latter types of IgG preparations were refractory to a second dose 24 hours later. The involvement of PAF in the kinin-independent hypotensive action is suggested by the finding that PAF-receptor antagonist BN 52021 prevented the effect and returned the blood pressure close to normality when given during hypotension. A blockade of Kupffer cells brought about by administration of GdCl3 was also found to prevent the effect pointing to the involvement of these type of cells in the reactions.",

    "171": "The cost-effectiveness of treating mild-to-moderate hypertension (diastolic blood pressures, 90-114 mmHg) was evaluated using the latest available information on both costs and benefits. The net health care costs of lifelong treatment for hypertension, at a 5% discount rate, ranged from 1491 pounds to 2752 pounds in men and from 1568 pounds to 2850 pounds in women in New Zealand in 1988 (1.00 pounds = $NZ 2.81). These figures take into account the savings in health care costs arising from stroke prevention. The net health care benefits, measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 5%, ranged from--2 days (a net negative effect of treatment) to 64 days in men and from--18 days to 35 days in women. The cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy discounted at 5% (excluding categories of patients for whom the ratio was undefined due to a net negative effect of treatment on QALYs) ranged from 11,058 pounds to 63,760 pounds per QALY gained in men and from 22,060 pounds to 194,989 pounds per QALY gained in women. Treatment was more cost-effective in men than in women, in older age groups and at higher levels of pretreatment diastolic blood pressure. The cost-effectiveness ratios were highly sensitive to the discount rate used (with the majority of ratios in women being undefined at a 10% discount rate) and the costs of the regimen used (diuretic monotherapy being the most cost-effective, followed by beta-blockers, then angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), as well as to the assumptions made about the impact of medication side effects on patient quality of life. These results call for a re-examination of resource allocation to antihypertensive treatment and point to the need to make assessments of the cost-effectiveness of alternative, non-pharmacological approaches to stroke prevention.", 
    "172": "1. To evaluate whether endogenous peptide release is involved in the airway responses to inhaled platelet-activating factor, we measured lung resistance and airway microvascular leakage in anaesthetized guinea pigs pretreated with inhalation of either saline or a combination of the peptidase inhibitors phosphoramidon (0.1 mmol/l: 60 breaths; 7.5 nmol), to inhibit neutral endopeptidase, and captopril (4.6 mmmol/l: 60 breaths; 350 nmol), to inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme. 2. Airway microvascular leakage was determined by the albumin marker Evans Blue dye injected intravenously (20 mg/kg) before platelet-activating factor or sham challenge. 3. Inhaled platelet-activating factor induced a maximum increase in lung resistance (1.43 +/- 0.33 cmH2O s-1 ml-1) which was not significantly different after pretreatment with phosphoramidon and captopril (1.44 +/- 0.21 cmH2O s-1 ml-1). 4. Inhalation of platelet-activating factor caused a significant increase in extravasated Evans Blue dye at all airway levels, an effect which was not potentiated by peptidase inhibition. Similar results were obtained with dye extravasated into the airway lumen and absorbed by a filter paper placed on the tracheal mucosa. Approximately 11% of the total tracheal dye was found in the lumen. There was a high correlation between tracheal tissue and tracheal lumen Evans Blue dye (r = 0.91; P less than 0.001). 5. We found a significantly lower dry to wet weight ratio in proximal intrapulmonary airways of animals exposed to platelet-activating factor, suggesting that platelet-activating factor caused airway oedema at this airway level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "173": "Kininase II (EC 3.4.15.1) (KII) and kininase I (KI) (EC 3.4.12.7) activities of rat plasma were characterized by the hydrolysis of hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL), hippuryl-L-arginine (HLA) [expressed as carboxypeptidase N1 (CN1) activity] and hippuryl-L-lysine (HLL) [expressed as carboxypeptidase N2 (CN2) activity]. Using a spectrophotometric assay, biochemical characteristics of the three enzymes were investigated. The Michaelis-Menten constants were as follows: KII: Km 2.55 +/- 0.22 mM, Vmax 0.357 +/- 0.017 mumol/min/mL; CN1: Km 6.93 +/- 0.32 mM, Vmax 0.748 +/- 0.019 mumol/min/mL; and CN2: Km 35.8 +/- 1.52 mM, Vmax 13.11 +/- 0.40 mumol/min/mL. EDTA and O-phenanthroline inhibited the three enzyme assays at the same Ki, whereas captopril and 2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidinoethylthiopropanoic acid (MERGETPA), allowed for the demonstration of the specificity of each assay. Furthermore, Ki values of MERGETPA against both CN1 (4.75 microM) and CN2 (2.36 microM) activities do not support the hypothesis that KI activity may be accounted for by the presence of isoenzymes in rat plasma.", 
    "174": "Healthy adults were given captopril (25 mg and 75 mg) po with or without dexamethasone (DXM) pretreatment (1 mg po 2 h before and simultaneously with the captopril). We determined the serum potassium and sodium concentrations, plasma prostaglandin E2 level, PRA, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, and aldosterone level from 20 min before to 120 min after administration of captopril. DXM pretreatment stimulated the PRA response to captopril. This stimulation was suppressed by indomethacin. However, the administration of DXM did not induce a consistent rise in the prostaglandin E2 level. The administration of DXM induced a significant rise in the potassium concentration, but since simultaneous administration of indomethacin with captopril induced the suppression of PRA without affecting the potassium level, the PRA increase in response to captopril with DXM was not caused directly by the potassium increase. There were no significant differences in the PRA increase between 25 mg captopril and 75 mg captopril, or between DXM-25 mg captopril and DXM-75 mg captopril, though the inhibitions of ACE activity by captopril differed according to dose. The PRA increases, but not the captopril-induced inhibition of ACE activity, were significantly different between captopril alone and captopril with DXM pretreatment at either dose of captopril. Thus, the inhibition of ACE activity perhaps allows PRA to increase in response to captopril. These results suggest that the DXM stimulation of PRA may have been dependent on the inhibition of ACE activity by captopril.", 
    "175": "The mechanism of action of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in diabetics is controversial. In order to dissociate the hypotensive and intrarenal effects, 16 insulin-dependant diabetics with permanent microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 h) without hypertension were given Ramipril, a long acting ACE inhibitor, at hypotensive (treatment A 5 mg/day; N = 8) and at sub-hypotensive doses (treatment B, 1.25 mg/day; N = 8) over a 6 week period in parallel double-blind study. Blood pressure, UAE, glomerular filtration renal blood flow (continuous 125I-Iodothalamate + 131I-Hippurate infusion) and converting enzyme activity (Liebermann's method), before and after treatment. In treatment group A, the blood pressure fell from 133 +/- 5/79 +/- 4 (mean +/- SE) to 125 +/- 4/77 +/- 2 mmHg (p less than 0.05 for systolic blood pressure) whereas it remained stable in treatment group B (132 +/- 7/79 +/- 4 to 128 +/- 5/80 +/- 4 mmHg).

    "176": "The close relationship between diabetes and hypertension has been recognized for decades. New information indicates that resistance to insulin action on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues is a common underlying mechanism in hypertension and diabetes. In prospective trials, the effects of antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism have been evaluated. Both beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics worsen insulin resistance and deteriorate lipoprotein metabolism. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ca2(+)-channel blockers, and alpha-blockers are neutral or improve these factors. These data may explain the unexpectedly high incidence of the development of diabetes among treated hypertensives and the poor effect on risk for coronary heart disease in intervention trials.", 
    "177": "Hemodynamic and structural changes of the heart and large arterial vessels were studied in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats following 12 weeks administration of converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril, 2 mg/kg daily by gavage). In both strains, a significant blood pressure reduction was observed. In normotensive rats, the hemodynamic changes involved significant increase in systemic arterial compliance whereas slight changes in left ventricular weight and aortic medial thickness were observed. In hypertensive rats, the increase in compliance was relatively small, whereas there was a major reduction in medial thickness. Furthermore, the reduction of the media thickness was much more pronounced than that of the left ventricular hypertrophy. The present results suggest that the cardiac and arterial changes observed following long term converting enzyme inhibition do not strictly parallel the blood pressure changes in hypertensive rats. Dissociation between cardiac and arterial changes may be observed.", 
    "178": "We studied the effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, systemic and coronary hemodynamics, and mechanical cardiac performance in renovascular hypertensive rats (Goldblatt, two-kidneys, one-clip). Systemic and coronary hemodynamics, before and after carbochrome infusion, were assessed by radioactive microspheres injection via an atrial catheter in conscious rats. Mechanical performance was measured on isolated papillary muscle from the same animal. Twelve treated hypertensive rats were compared with 10 nontreated hypertensive rats and nine sham-operated normotensive rats of the same age. Perindopril treatment induced a complete control of blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 156 +/- 22 mm Hg in the untreated group to 100 +/- 24 mm Hg in the treated group (P less than .01), compared to 106 +/- 18 mm Hg in the sham group). This was associated with a nearly complete regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass/body weight 2.26 +/- 0.38 mg/g in the treated group v 3.1 +/- 0.6 in the untreated group [P less than .01], compared to 2 +/- 0.25 mg/g in the sham group [p = NS]). Minimal left ventricular coronary resistances after carbochrome were slightly higher in the hypertensive group compared both to sham and treated group. A reversal of impaired myocardial mechanical parameters towards control values was observed, except for some parameters of relaxation. We conclude that perindopril allows in this model a complete control of blood pressure, and a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with normalization of coronary hemodynamics and contractile function.",

Normalization of the blood pressure can be achieved by intervention (operation, percutaneous transluminal renal angiography; PTRA), in cases of prolonged RAS-induced hypertension long-term preservation of the organ function is most important. The purpose of this study was the validation of captopril renography as a screening test for hypertension secondary to RAS prior to PTRA. Captopril renography with 99mTc-MAG 3 has a high sensitivity (94%) and acceptable specificity (88%) for the screening of hypertensive patients.

Baseline studies were obtained only for those patients showing abnormal findings in the provocative study. All patients underwent renal arteriography. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of renal artery stenosis (RAS) greater than 50% were 89% and 91%, respectively. After Captopril administration, tracer parenchymal transit time increased significantly in ischemic kidneys (334 +/- 93 sec in baseline conditions versus 468 +/- 96 sec after Captopril, p less than 0.001) but not in kidneys with no RAS or RAS less than 50% (243 +/- 46 sec versus 271 +/- 95 sec, p = ns). False-positive responses were mostly bilateral and associated with a marked decrease in blood pressure. Technetium-99m-MAG3 is an effective compound for detecting RAS greater than or equal to 50% with Captopril renal scintigraphy. Performing the provocative test as a first step considerably reduced the number of scintigraphic studies required.", 
    "181": "The purpose of this study was to examine effects of antihypertensive treatment on structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles and the incidence of stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Treatment of hypertension was begun at 3 months of age with cilazapril (45 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or with hydralazine (18 mg/kg/day). Cilazapril and hydralazine reduced systolic arterial pressure (from 195 +/- 8 to 125 +/- 5 and 148 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively [mean +/- SEM]; p less than 0.05). To examine structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles, we measured pressure (servonull), external diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (histologically) in pial arterioles of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHRSP that were untreated or that were treated for 3 months with cilazapril or with hydralazine. Arterioles were maximally dilated with EDTA. In WKY rats, cilazapril and hydralazine did not alter pial arteriolar pressure, external diameter, or cross-sectional area of the vessel wall. In SHRSP, both cilazapril and hydralazine reduced cross-sectional area of the vessel wall to levels not significantly different from WKY rats (from 1,911 +/- 155 to 1,244 +/- 101 and 1,388 +/- 59 microns 2, respectively, compared with 1,405 +/- 95 microns 2 for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril was more effective than hydralazine in reducing pial arteriolar pressure (from 110 +/- 6 to 62 +/- 2 mm Hg with cilazapril versus 79 +/- 5 mm Hg for hydralazine compared with 60 +/- 4 mm Hg for untreated WKY rats). Cilazapril, but not hydralazine, attenuated reductions in external diameter of pial arterioles (from 91 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 4 microns for cilazapril versus 91 +/- 3 microns for hydralazine compared with 107 +/- 3 microns for untreated WKY rats).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

All three enzymes were inhibited by captopril and enalapril and their activity was potentiated by chloride ions. They were capable of degrading Leu-enkephalin-Arg6 and substance -P, but gave no conversion of neurokinin A. In all these aspects, the CSF enzymes were identical with the human pulmonary enzyme. The Mr 40,000 form of ACE is the smallest active form of the enzyme hitherto reported and is likely to represent a fragment of the C-terminal part of native ACE, where its active center is located.", 
    "183": "Effects of captopril, clonidine, hydralazine, metoprolol, and prazosin on the circadian variability of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) as well as on BP and HR rises at awakening were studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). An on-line computerized system was used for continuous intraarterial (i.a.) recording of BP and HR. Drugs were infused intravenously (i.v.) with osmotic minipumps. Circadian BP patterns were more pronounced and variable in SHR than in Wistar-Kyoto normotensive control rats. HR patterns were similar in both groups. Antihypertensive treatment resulted in differential effects on the expression of the circadian BP and HR patterns in SHR. Reductions in BP variability and reductions in the awakening increase in BP were not correlated with the BP-lowering efficacy of agents. Treatment with clonidine reduced both circadian variability of BP and HR and the awakening increase. Prazosin reduced circadian BP variability and its awakening increase, whereas metoprolol reduced circadian HR variability only. Hydralazine and captopril did not cause any major effects on the circadian variability of BP and HR. These data indicate that circadian rhythms of BP and HR are under sympathetic control in SHR and are not influenced by nonsympatholytic vasodilators.", 
    "184": "The specific neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, SQ 29,072 (7-[2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]amino]heptanoic acid), was studied in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and in DOCA/salt hypertensive rats during inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity with captopril or SQ 27,519 (the free acid of fosinopril). In the SHR, the maximal depressor responses to the combination of SQ 29,072 and SQ 27,519 (-44 +/- 4 mm Hg) were greater than the responses to any of the inhibitors given alone (-26 +/- 5, -40 +/- 10, and -28 +/- 6 mm Hg for SQ 29,072, captopril, and SQ 27,519, respectively). In contrast, the maximal antihypertensive activities of SQ 29,072 were the same in conscious DOCA/salt hypertensive rats infused with saline, captopril, or SQ 27,519 (-54 +/- 10, -51 +/- 8, and -58 +/- 11 mm Hg, respectively), indicating a lack of synergism in this model. In agreement, SQ 28,133 [N-[2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxo-3-phenylpropyl]-L-leucine], a compound that inhibits both NEP and ACE, elicited significant depressor activities in both SHR and DOCA/salt hypertensive rats. In conclusion, a selective NEP inhibitor enhanced the depressor activity of ACE inhibitors in the conscious SHR, indicating that these agents may be effectively combined for treatment of some types of hypertension.", 
    "185": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril has been shown to reverse vascular tolerance to nitroglycerin (NTG). Whether captopril reverses NTG tolerance by providing sulfhydryl (SH) groups or by inhibiting ACE is not clear. To examine this issue, we treated rat aortic rings with buffer, captopril (SH +, ACE inhibitory activity +), enalaprilat (SH-, ACE inhibitory activity +), or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, SH+, ACE inhibitory activity-) prior to their contraction with epinephrine and subsequent relaxation with NTG. Previous exposure of NTG-treated rings resulted in marked resistance to the vasorelaxant effect of a subsequent exposure to NTG in buffer-treated rings. Both NAC and captopril, but not enalaprilat, potentiated the vasorelaxant effects of NTG during the first exposure of vascular rings to NTG and also prevented the development of tolerance to NTG during a second exposure. Buffer-treated rings showed an inability to accumulate cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in response to a second exposure to NTG. In contrast, both NAC and captopril-pretreated rings demonstrated a persistence of cyclic GMP accumulation during the second NTG exposure. The endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACh) caused relaxation of the NTG-tolerant rings and also induced cyclic GMP accumulation in these rings. In other experiments, we found that prior exposure of vascular rings to ACh did not cause resistance to the subsequent vasorelaxant effects of ACh. NAC, captopril, and enalaprilat did not modulate the effects of ACh during either the first or subsequent exposures to ACh. In addition, indomethacin did not influence the \"protective\" effects of NAC or captopril against NTG tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "186": "We have investigated the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system to the damage caused by 40-min global ischemia in the isolated rat heart. A converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat (70 nM), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, compound 89 (2 microM), and an inhibitor of rat renin, CGP 44099A (20 nM), given before ischemia reduced the median duration of ventricular fibrillation on reperfusion to a similar extent (5.53, 5.72, and 5.14 min, respectively, compared to 13.98 min in the control group) but had no effect on creatine phosphokinase release (22.2 +/- 2.6, 22.1 +/- 6.8, and 24.1 +/- 3.6, IU/30 min, respectively, compared to 19.9 +/- 1.9 IU/30 min) or recovery or left ventricular developed pressure (67 +/- 6, 73 +/- 7 and 71 +/- 6%, respectively, compared to 66 +/- 3% after 30 min reperfusion). The increase in coronary resistance and left ventricular diastolic pressure on reperfusion was not affected by any of the agents. All three agents also tended to reduce the duration of ventricular fibrillation when given only on reperfusion. We conclude that angiotensinogen is present in the rat heart and it is converted to angiotensin I by a renin or a renin-like aspartic proteinase. The angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by converting enzyme. The angiotensin II formed is an important mediator of postreperfusion ventricular fibrillation in the isolated rat heart but does not contribute to the reduction in mechanical function produced by global ischemia in this preparation.", 
    "187": "Quinapril is a monoethyl ester which is hydrolysed after absorption to form an active metabolite, quinaprilat, which is a more potent angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor than the parent drug. Quinaprilat has a short elimination half-life but a potent binding affinity for ACE which enables once daily administration. Data from clinical studies indicate that quinapril 10 to 40 mg daily, given as a single dose, is an effective antihypertensive agent, suitable as monotherapy for reducing high blood pressure and maintaining satisfactory control during long term treatment of mild to severe hypertension. Dosages of 80 mg daily have been used in some patients. Concomitant diuretic therapy usually elicits a response in patients who fail to respond adequately to monotherapy. Initial studies suggest that quinapril also has a role in the treatment of mild to severe congestive heart failure. In the few long term studies conducted the beneficial acute haemodynamic effects were maintained during long term treatment and were accompanied by symptomatic and functional improvement. The majority of these patients responded to twice daily administration. Adverse effects associated with the antihypertensive action of quinapril are generally mild, well tolerated and are similar to those of other ACE inhibitors. Thus, quinapril appears to be a useful alternative ACE inhibitor for the treatment of mild to severe hypertension and congestive heart failure.", 
    "188": "The chronotropic responses to angiotensins I and II (5 micrograms in 1 mL Tyrode's solution) injected into the sinus node artery were assessed before and after the intravenous administration of captopril (2 mg/kg) and saralasin (20 micrograms/kg) in anaesthetized dogs. The effects of angiotensin II given intravenously were also observed. The animals (n = 8) were vagotomized and pretreated with propranolol (1 mg/kg, i.v.) to prevent baroreceptor-mediated responses to increases in blood pressure. Injection of angiotensin I into the sinus node artery induced significant increases in heart rate (114 +/- 6 vs. 133 +/- 6 beats/min) and in systemic systolic (134 +/- 13 vs. 157 +/- 14 mmHg; 1 mmHg = 133.3 Pa) and diastolic (95 +/- 10 vs. 126 +/- 13 mmHg) blood pressures. Similar results were obtained when angiotensin II was injected into the sinus node artery, but intravenous injection induced changes in systolic (138 +/- 8 vs. 180 +/- 25 mmHg) and diastolic (103 +/- 8 vs. 145 +/- 20 mmHg) blood pressures only. Captopril induced a significant decrease in systolic (118 +/- 11 vs. 88 +/- 12 mmHg) and diastolic (84 +/- 9 vs. 59 +/- 9 mmHg) blood pressures without affecting the heart rate (109 +/- 6 vs. 106 +/- 6 beats/min). Saralasin produced a significant increase in systolic (109 +/- 7 vs. 126 +/- 12 mmHg) blood pressure only. Increments in heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures in response to angiotensins I and II were, respectively, abolished by captopril and saralasin. It was concluded that angiotensin II has, in vivo, a direct positive chronotropic effect that can be blocked by saralasin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

We compared the effects, after 3 weeks oral therapy, of xamoterol 200 mg twice daily and enalapril 2.5, 5 or 10 mg twice daily on home and clinic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow, stroke and minute distances, linear resistance and on plasma renin activity in 19 patients with mild to moderate heart failure in a single-blind randomised crossover study. 2. Enalapril reduced mean home blood pressure by 17/7 mm Hg compared with xamoterol (P less than 0.0001) and by 19/7 mm Hg compared with placebo. Compared with placebo xamoterol had no effect. Enalapril reduced predose blood pressure, compared with xamoterol, on average by 15/5 mm Hg (P = 0.02 systolic, 0.09 diastolic) and by 20/7 mm Hg compared with placebo. At 4 h post-dose the mean differences were: xamoterol-enalapril 13/10 mm Hg (P = 0.01 systolic, 0.0007 diastolic) and placebo-enalapril 23/9 mm Hg. 3. Stroke and minute distances were marginally less 4 h following xamoterol than following enalapril: mean (s.e. mean) values were 9.4 (0.7) vs 10.4 (0.8) cm (P = 0.23) and 699 (51.7) vs 767 (62.1) cm (P = 0.04) respectively. Linear resistance was reduced by enalapril, from the placebo value of 13.2 (1.2) to 11.0 (0.9) mm Hg m-1 and marginally increased by xamoterol, to 14.2 (1.2) mm Hg m-1, the difference between active treatments being statistically significant (P = 0.03). 4. Renal plasma flow, GFR and filtration fraction were not influenced by enalapril or xamoterol therapy. There were no significant correlations between glomerular filtration rate and either blood pressure or stroke distance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "190": "Ideally, an antihypertensive agent should have a neutral effect or, preferably, produce a favorable shift in the serum lipid and lipoprotein profile, which is associated with a decrease in coronary heart disease risk. The thiazides and loop diuretics increase total lipid levels, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. beta-Blockers without beta 2-agonist properties increase triglycerides and decrease high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and combined alpha/beta-blockers are generally thought to have little effect on the lipid profile, although some studies have indicated a modest beneficial effect. alpha-Adrenoceptor antagonists are known to reduce LDL cholesterol levels modestly and to increase HDL cholesterol levels. The overall results of the currently available studies with celiprolol, a selective beta 1-antagonist with ancillary beta 2-agonist and vasodilating properties, indicate a favorable effect of the drug on serum lipid and lipoprotein profiles.", 
    "191": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of lisinopril (L), a novel ACE inhibitor, was compared to captopril (C), the known and already approved drug in our country in a multicenter double-blind Yugoslav trial. The study included 91 mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients of both sexes. Forty-six patients were randomized to receive captopril and 45 lisinopril. After a 2 week placebo, the examinees were administered either L in increasing dose of 10, 20, or 40 mg per day (amount necessary to achieve normotension), or C in a dosage of 25, 50, or 100 mg per day. During the 8 week formal trial L decreased the systolic blood pressure by an average of 14.9% from the initial values, and the diastolic pressure by some 15.2%. The same parameters were lowered on C by 11.2%, and 11.7%, respectively. Although the L effects were more pronounced, the observed differences did not reach the level of statistical significance (except for the dose-to-normotension relationship which was significantly better in the L group). It is concluded that both ACEIs under study showed comparable efficacy and tolerability, L being marginally more potent, and longer acting.", 
    "192": "Helodermin (HDM) belongs to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) family of polypeptides. Degradation of HDM in the tracheal tissue isolated from a guinea-pig and by an isolated enkephalinase was studied and compared with the degradation of VIP. The tracheal relaxing activity of VIP was potentiated by enkephalinase inhibitors, thiorphan and phosphoramidon, while the activity of HDM was not potentiated. On the other hand, bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, and captopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, did not influence the activity of VIP and HDM. The data suggests that the degradation of VIP but not HDM in the trachea was done by enkephalinase. Enkephalinase was then purified from the lung and the striatum membrane fraction through a DEAE-cellulose column, chromatofocusing column and hydroxyapatite column. The purified enkephalinase from the lung hydrolyzed VIP but not HDM. HDM and VIP were, however, hydrolyzed by the striatum enkephalinase. There was only a partial degradation of HDM by the striatum enkephalinase and the hydrolysis rate of HDM was slower than that of VIP. The degradation of VIP and HDM was inhibited by thiorphan. In conclusion, we found that VIP but not HDM was degraded by enkephalinase present in the respiratory system such as the trachea and the lung. Furthermore, enkephalinase, which hydrolyses HDM, was present in the brain.", 
    "193": "The pulmonary and hepatic clearances of the synthesized angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) substrate, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) were evaluated by applying the multiple sites of input method and the recirculation pharmacokinetic model. Rats received a constant rate infusion via the carotid artery, jugular vein or portal vein in the absence or presence of the ACE inhibitor, captopril. Blood samples were collected from the femoral artery. The organ extraction ratio was calculated from the steady-state plasma concentrations and the mean organ transit time was computed as the difference in the mean residence times for various administration routes. Pronounced elimination in the lung and liver was observed in the absence of captopril. Pulmonary metabolism was completely depressed in the presence of captopril while the hepatic elimination was little affected. This suggests that the pulmonary elimination was entirely ascribed to ACE while there exists an alternative elimination process in the liver. The mean cardiopulmonary transit time was very short, indicating the pulmonary elimination of HHL may take place on the surface of the vascular endothelium. The evaluation of the pulmonary elimination of HHL described in this paper indicates a simple in vivo method for assessing the pharmacological effect of ACE inhibitors. The present pharmacokinetic approach will be useful for the quantification of drug disposition in individual organs in vivo.", 
    "194": "Increasing evidence in recent years suggests an important role of the central renin-angiotensin system in cardiovascular regulation. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a pivotal element in this system, little is known about the enzyme in human brain. Thus, the regional distribution and biochemical properties of ACE were investigated in human brain. The highest activity was found in the hypothalamus (1.23 +/- 0.22 units/mg protein), followed by the caudate nucleus (1.06 +/- 0.23), substantia nigra (0.97 +/- 0.20), medulla oblongata (0.59 +/- 0.17), cerebral cortex (0.30 +/- 0.07), and cerebellum (0.08 +/- 0.02). A high activity was also detected in the pituitary (0.66 +/- 0.12). This enzyme activity was almost completely (70-90%) suppressed by a specific antibody raised against pure human kidney ACE, indicating that the majority of the activity measured is due to true ACE. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 290,000 on gel-exclusion chromatography, 152,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and 158,000 by an immunoprecipitation technique coupled with SDS-PAGE. The optimum pH was 8.0-8.5. The enzyme activity was elevated by increasing concentrations of NaCl, indicating a chloride ion dependency of the enzyme. Most of the enzyme (greater than 80%) was bound to concanavalin A, suggesting the presence of carbohydrate residues. These findings provide evidence for the presence of specific ACE in discrete areas of human brain and suggest that angiotensin II could be generated locally in these structures to exert cardiovascular effects in humans.", 
    "195": "The role of angiotensin system in the development of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, in nine pigs (50 +/- 8 kg) were studied. A Swan-Ganz Catheter and an arterial catheter were inserted into the pulmonary artery and aorta, pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), Cardiac output (CO) and arterial blood gases were monitored before and after hypoxia and captopril injection (7.3 mg/kg.iv). Plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin II (AT-II) were measured by RIA. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was measured by fluorometry. Results showed that during hypoxemia (PaO2 6.3 +/- 0.2 kPa, PaCO2 5.4 +/- 0.2 kPa), PAP increased from 2.43 +/- 0.17 to 3.76 +/- 0.2 kPa, (P less than 0.05) and right ventricle stroke work index (BVSWI) from 55.7 +/- 7.2 to 91.3 +/- 9.3 mJ/m2 (P less than 0.05). PRA increased from 0.56 +/- 0.19 to 1.28 +/- 6.30 mol. L-1/h (P less than 0.02) and AT-II from 62.4 +/- 17.4 to 133.3 +/- 31.8 ng/L (P less than 0.01); but ACE decreased from 77.6 +/- 5.6 to 58.4 +/- 4.2 mumol.min-1/L (P less than 0.02). After Captopril injection ACE was reduced to 26.7 +/- 3.4 mumol.min-1/L (P less than 0.001) and AT-II dropped to 61.9 +/- 15.5 ng/L (P less than 0.01), as compared with those during hypoxemia. There was significant correlation between PAP and PRA (r = 0.5643 P less than 0.01). We surmise that angiotensin system may play a part in acute hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, and captopril Inhibits AT-II, leading to the drop of pulmonary arterial pressure.", 
    "196": "The pattern of inhibition of tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was studied in rats after acute and chronic (14 days) oral administration of perindopril. Free and total tissue ACE were measured by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using [125I]-351A as a radioligand and compared with plasma ACE and pressor responses to angiotensin I. Following oral perindopril, plasma perindoprilic acid and the pattern of inhibition of plasma ACE activity were maximal at 1 to 2 h, but recovered over 24 h. However, inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I was more prolonged, being 95% at 4 h, but had not fully recovered by 24 h. Acutely, ACE was markedly inhibited in renal proximal tubules, lung parenchyma, and aortic wall. At 24 h, ACE in these tissues had only partially recovered. Angiotensin converting enzyme in vascular endothelium of other organs showed a similar pattern of inhibition. In contrast, ACE in testicular seminiferous tubules was unaffected by perindopril. After chronic (14 days) administration of perindopril, total plasma ACE increased 3-fold, of which 49% was occupied by the inhibitor. Total tissue ACE in kidney and aorta did not change, and the pattern of inhibition observed acutely was maintained during chronic treatment. These results demonstrate a prolonged effect of ACE inhibitors on tissue ACE that may better explain the time course of these drugs than the changes in plasma ACE or plasma levels of the drugs.", 
    "197": "Studies on the effects of peptidase inhibitors on substance P-like immunoreactive material (SPLI) released by K(+)-induced depolarization from slices of the rat spinal cord showed that bacitracin was the most potent agent to protect SPLI from degradation. Captopril and thiorphan which inhibit, respectively, angiotensin I converting enzyme and endopeptidase-24.11 also protected SPLI from degradation. However other inhibitors of these two enzymes, kelatorphan for endopeptidase-24.11 and enalaprilat for angiotensin I converting enzyme were essentially inactive, indicating that both enzymes are probably not involved in the degradation of endogenous substance P. Instead, the non-additive protecting effect of bacitracin, captopril and thiorphan might be due to the blockade of some 'bacitracin-sensitive enzyme' playing a key role in the catabolism of SP within the rat spinal cord.", 
    "198": "Since 1984 25 cases of enalapril induced angioedema have been reported to the Netherlands Center for Monitoring of Adverse Reactions to Drugs. Two patients with enalapril induced angioedema are described. The pathophysiological mechanism of this potentially life-threatening adverse effect is probably not a direct allergic response to the drug itself. Enalapril inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, which not only metabolizes angiotensin I but also bradykinin and 'substance P'. Bradykinin and 'substance PH may then accumulate and cause angioedema in a direct or indirect way. It is of great importance that instances of oropharyngeal swelling are considered a possible result of an adverse reaction to ACE-inhibitors.", 
    "199": "[125I]Iodocyanopindolol binding sites were characterized by autoradiography in the superior cervical ganglia of Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. A high concentration of (-)-[125I]iodocyanopindolol binding sites, characterized as beta-adrenoceptors by (-)-propranolol displacement, was distributed throughout the ganglia and in the postganglionic (internal carotid) nerve. ICI 118,551, a beta 2-selective antagonist, displaced more than 85% of the binding sites, whereas CGP 20712A, a beta 1-selective antagonist, displaced less than 10% of the binding sites, indicating that the beta-adrenoceptors were primarily of the beta 2-subtype. Emulsion autoradiography demonstrated that at least part of the binding sites were associated with principal ganglion cells. Unilateral deafferentation did not modify the number of binding sites in the superior cervical ganglia of WKY or spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). These results suggest that at least part of these receptors may correspond to prejunctional beta 2-adrenoceptors originated in principal ganglion cells. The concentration of beta 2-receptors was increased in the superior cervical ganglia of young and adult SHR when compared to age-matched WKY rats (49% and 39%, respectively). There were no differences in beta 2-adrenoceptor number in the stellate ganglia of young and adult WKY and SHR. These results suggest that beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation may be selectively enhanced in some peripheral sympathetic ganglia in SHR and this could play a role in the development and maintenance of the increased sympathetic activity in this strain.", 
    "200": "The effects of antihypertensive drugs on mortality from stroke, coronary artery disease (CAD), and nonvascular causes have been studied in 14 trials involving more than 37,000 patients. In the treated patients, blood pressure was 5 to 6 mm Hg lower than that in placebo-treated patients, and whereas mortality from stroke was reduced by 42%, CAD mortality was reduced by only 14%. A major reason for this lack of effect on CAD mortality is apparently the adverse effects of the primary drugs used in these trials (diuretics and beta blockers) on glucose tolerance, lipid levels, and insulin resistance. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors favorably influence many CAD risk factors, and their use can be expected to reduce CAD mortality in patients treated for hypertension.", 
    "201": "During the past few years, dry cough has been described as a possible adverse effect of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. There have been several studies of the effect of long-term administration of ACE inhibitors on pulmonary function. We examined spirometrically the effect of a single oral dose of captopril (25 mg) on bronchial tonus in those who had not received the drug previously, in 4 patients who had previously had dry cough during ACE inhibitor therapy, in 20 patients with obstructive pulmonary disease and in 20 control subjects without pulmonary disease. 1 hour after ingestion of captopril there were no significant changes in the spirometric tests of any group. These findings supplement the results of similar tests done during longterm administration of ACE inhibitors, indicating that the pathogenesis of cough elicited by ACE inhibitor therapy does not seem to have an asthmatic basis.", 
    "202": "Electrical stimulation of the isolated rat mesenteric vascular bed resulted in a frequency-dependent pressor response, which could be potentiated by increasing concentrations of renin substrate (synthetic tetradecapeptide). This potentiating effect appeared to be mediated by tissue conversion of renin substrate to angiotensin II because the response 1) could be mimicked by angiotensin II, 2) was accompanied by an increase in angiotensin II production and 3) was blocked by the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor quinaprilat and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist saralasin ([Sar1,Ile5,Ala8]angiotensin II). To assess the role of this tissue renin-angiotensin system in contributing to blood pressure regulation, spontaneously hypertensive rats were administered the prodrug ACE inhibitor quinapril at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days. Such administration resulted in a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 48 +/- 3 mm Hg, a greater than 95% inhibition of serum ACE activity, and a significant attenuation of the potentiating effect of renin substrate on electrically evoked contractions of isolated mesenteric beds. Significant reductions in blood pressure and the potentiating effect of renin substrate on the isolated mesenteric vasculature were still observed 24 and 48 hr after the last dose of quinapril. In contrast, serum ACE activity returned to normal levels within 48 hr after the last dose of quinapril. These results suggest that the changes in tissue renin-angiotensin system, and not the circulating system, are closely related to the blood pressure lowering effect of the ACE inhibitor, quinapril.", 
    "203": "Cough is one of the possible untoward adverse drug effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. We describe the available information on 50 cough episodes attributable to captopril and 18 episodes attributable to enalapril reported to the Spanish Drug Surveillance System. Cough represented 37% and 39% of the reports of side effects of captopril and enalapril, respectively. There was a remarkable female predominance among the patients with cough. Cough developed at very low doses (15 mg of captopril and 5 mg of enalapril daily), although the patients on captopril who developed cough were receiving higher doses than those who presented other side effects. A high proportion of patients (29%) continued with the drug for more than six months after cough had developed, suggesting the need for a wider knowledge of this side effect.", 
    "204": "Exposure to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been associated with increased ACE activity in vivo and in vitro. In the current study, we examined the effects of ACE inhibitors on ACE gene expression and activity in brain and primary neuronal cultures prepared from brains of neonatal spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. ACE mRNA levels were increased in brain and neuronal cultures following ACE inhibitor exposure. A concomitant increase in ACE activity was evident in brain, but ACE activity was decreased in neuronal cultures following ACE inhibitor exposure. Since ACE has been localized to several cell types in the brain, including endothelial cells and glia, as well as neurons, the differences in ACE activity between whole brain and neuronal cultures following exposure to ACE inhibitors may be related to differential regulation of the ACE gene in these cell types. These findings and the observation that ACE mRNA levels are >20-fold higher in cultured neurons from neonatal SHR than in those from WKY support the conclusions that the activity of the brain renin angiotensin system is enhanced in SHR and that blockade of this system by chronic ACE inhibitor treatment contributes to the sustained antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors in this model.", 
    "205": "After myocardial infarction, the renin-angiotensin system is found to be activated. While this response may be beneficial in acute failure, it could be detrimental in chronic stages. Therefore effects of captopril therapy were investigated during early and later phases after myocardial infarction in conscious rats, chronically instrumented for hemodynamic measurements. Hemodynamics were measured at baseline and after stimulating the heart by a volume load (cardiac function curve). Myocardial infarction decreased baseline cardiac output and impaired cardiac function, without effects on baseline mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure and heart rate. Captopril given 3 to 5 weeks after infarction improved cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner by increasing stroke volume, whereas stroke work was not affected. In contrast, captopril given from 1 to 21 days after infarction did not lead to improved cardiac function; instead, tachycardia together with a decreased stroke volume suggested deterioration, rather than improvement, of cardiac function. These data indicate that captopril therapy in chronically infarcted conscious rats improved cardiac function when treatment was started after completion of the healing process, but that early treatment not only failed to improve ventricular function, but may have a deleterious effect of the heart.", 
    "206": "To assess the effects of ACE-inhibition on insulin action in Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus associated with essential hypertension, 12 patients with Type 2 diabetes (on diet and oral hypoglycaemic agents) and arterial hypertension were examined on two occasions, in a single blind, cross-over study after two days of treatment with either captopril or a placebo. The study consisted of a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp (two sequential steps of insulin infusion at the rates of 0.25 mU.kg-1.min-1 and 1 mU.kg-1.min-1, 2 h each step), combined with an infusion of 3-3H-glucose to measure the rate of hepatic glucose production and that of peripheral glucose utilization. The results show that blood pressure was lower after captopril (sitting, systolic 148 +/- 5 mm Hg, diastolic 89 +/- 2 mm Hg) compared to placebo (155 +/- 6 and 94 +/- 2 mm Hg) (p less than 0.05). Captopril treatment resulted in a more suppressed hepatic glucose production (2.7 +/- 0.4 vs 4.94 +/- 0.55 mumol.kg-1.min-1), and a lower plasma non-esterified fatty acid concentration (0.143 +/- 0.05 vs 0.200 +/- 0.05 mmol/l) (captopril vs placebo, p less than 0.05) at the end of the first step of insulin infusion (estimated portal plasma insulin concentration 305 +/- 28 pmol/l); and in a greater glucose utilization (36.5 +/- 5.1 vs 28 +/- 3.6 mumol.kg-1.min-1, p less than 0.001) at the end of the second step of insulin infusion (arterial plasma insulin concentration of 604 +/- 33 pmol/l).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "207": "1. The disposition of [14C]-labelled benazepril HCl, an ACE-inhibitor, was studied in four normal adult volunteers after a single oral dose of 20 mg and after repeated doses of 20 mg once daily for 5 days. Radioactivity was measured in plasma, urine and faeces. The prodrug ester benazepril and the pharmacologically active metabolite benazeprilat were determined quantitatively in plasma and urine by a g.c.-m.s. method. The pattern of metabolites in urine was analysed semiquantitatively by h.p.l.c.-radiometry. 2. After a single oral dose at least 37% was absorbed, as indicated by urinary recovery. The peak plasma concentration of benazepril (0.58 +/- 0.13 nmol/g (SD] was observed at 0.5h after dose, indicating rapid absorption. Peak concentrations of radioactivity (1.88 +/- 0.48 nmol/g) and of active benazeprilat (0.84 +/- 0.25 nmol/g) were observed at 1 h after dose, demonstrating rapid bioactivation. 3. The area under the plasma curve (AUC0-96 h) of total radioactivity amounted to 9.7 +/- 1.1 (nmol/g)h, 5% of which was accounted for by benazepril and about 50% by benazeprilat. 4. Over 9 days 96.8 +/- 0.5% of the dose was excreted in urine and faeces. Urinary excretion accounted for 37.0 +/- 6.0% of the dose, 80% of which was recovered in the first 8 h after dosing. 5. In urine, only 0.4% of the dose (1% of the radioactivity) was excreted as unchanged benazepril, indicating that the compound was extensively metabolized. Benazeprilat accounted for 17% of the dose (about half of the radioactivity; 0-96 h). Glucuronide conjugates of benazepril and benazeprilat constituting approximately 11% and 22% of the radioactivity (about 4% and 8% of the dose; 0-48 h) were tentatively identified. 6. Repeated oral treatment with benazepril HCl did not influence the pharmacologically relevant kinetics and disposition parameters.",

The effects were assessed by treadmill exercise tests performed before and repeatedly 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after the single dose of a drug or placebo. C, ID, and N were given in doses of 50, 10, and 20 mg, respectively. The drugs were equally effective in lowering systolic blood pressure at rest. Unlike ID and N, C failed to affect the duration of exercise testing until an anginal episode occurred and the magnitude of ST-segment depression at the same exercise intensity. ID and N caused a significant increase in the duration of exercise and a decrease in ST-segment depression during exercise 1-3 h later. An individual analysis has shown that C, ID, and N produced an antianginal effect only in 2, 9, and 10 patients, respectively. Thus, C is unable to show a substantial antianginal effect.", 
    "209": "After screening a local population in the northern part of The Netherlands for hypertension, 125 patients (116 of whom had not previously used antihypertensive drugs) with a five times elevated diastolic pressure (DP) of between 95 and 130 mmHg were randomized and treated daily either with atenolol 50 mg o.d. (n = 62) or with captopril 25 mg b.i.d. (n = 63) for 2 months under double-blind conditions. During this period the DP fell by 9 mm under atenolol (from 107 +/- 8 to 98 +/- 8) and by 8 mm under captopril (from 107 +/- 7 to 99 +/- 9). The number of responders with a DP = less than 90 mmHg was 21% and 20%, respectively. After 2 months the double-blind period was ended and the patients were submitted to a medication protocol for another 4 months in which an increased dose and additional nifedipine were given to non-responders. The response rate rose to 76% (atenolol/nifedipine combination) and to 60% (captopril/nifedipine combination) - NS. It is concluded that low doses of atenolol and captopril are equally effective in lowering blood pressure in uncomplicated mild to moderate hypertension.", 
    "210": "1. The role of the macula densa in renin synthesis was studied using mice with one hydronephrotic kidney. 2. Renin synthesis was assessed by measurement of renal renin, renal mRNA for renin and plasma renin. 3. Sodium depletion stimulated mRNA and renal renin to a similar extent in the hydronephrotic and contralateral kidney. 4. Enalapril stimulated mRNA concentration in both kidneys but renal renin did not rise in the hydronephrotic kidney. 5. Propranolol did not alter the response to sodium depletion in either kidney. 6. The macula densa is not crucial for the stimulation of renin synthesis following sodium depletion. However, it may regulate renin production after mRNA synthesis, possibly by controlling the conversion of prorenin to renin.", 
    "211": "Active renin is composed of multiple forms with variable isoelectric points. In this study, the relative proportions of five major active renin forms in human peripheral venous plasma were compared before and 2 h after stimulation of renin secretion with both converting enzyme inhibition (quinapril) and upright posture in five patients with essential hypertension. The five major active renin forms were separated by shallow gradient isoelectric focusing and quantitated by radioimmunoassay of generated angiotensin I. Plasma renin activity increased from 1.2 to 5.1 ng AI/mL/h (P less than .05). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the proportions of the two most basic renin forms and a significant decrease in the proportion of the most acidic form in venous plasma. Although the mechanism cannot be determined from this study, the altered renin form profile observed could have resulted from preferential renal secretion and/or altered hepatic extraction of the more basic forms. An altered renin form profile in response to acute stimulation has important physiologic implications. Since the relatively basic renin forms are preferentially degraded they possess shorter half-lives. Additionally, the multiple forms of active renin may be functionally heterogenous. Thus, acute stimulation of renin secretion may result in circulating renin with a shorter duration of action and different functional effects than renin released under steady state conditions.", 
    "212": "Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) was degraded by neuronal and glial cells cultured from fetal rat brain. The degradation of LHRH by neuronal cells was strongly inhibited by a metal chelator. Captopril only inhibited by generation of fragment (1-3) from fragment (1-5). In the presence of captopril, fragment (1-5) accumulated in the highest amount among the N-terminal fragments identified. The initial cleavage of LHRH, as determined by following the loss of the LHRH peak, was strongly inhibited by thiol-blocking reagents, as well as metal chelators. The results with glial cells were almost the same as those seen with neuronal cells. Thus, we propose that a thiol-dependent membrane-bound metallo-endopeptidase plays a major role in the initial stage of degradation of LHRH at the Tyr5-Gly6 bond in both neurons and glia. Angiotensin-converting enzyme is involved in the secondary process of the LHRH degradation in both cells.", 
    "213": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, particularly enalapril and captopril, have been shown to decrease proteinuria in diabetic animals and human subjects. Since heparan sulfate proteoglycan confers a negative charge on the glomerular basement membrane, and either decreased synthesis or loss of this charge causes albuminuria in diabetic animals, we examined the possibility that enalapril prevents albuminuria through glomerular preservation of heparan sulfate in long-term diabetic rats. A total of 22 male Wistar rats were used in the study. Diabetes was induced in 15 rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). The remaining 7 rats received buffer. One week following induction of diabetes, 8 diabetic rats were allowed to drink tap water containing enalapril at a concentration of 50 mg/liter; the remaining 7 diabetic and 7 nondiabetic rats were given only tap water. The drug treatment was continued for 20 weeks. Systolic blood pressure and 24-hr urinary excretion of albumin were measured at 2, 8, 16, and 20 weeks. At the end of 20 weeks, all rats were killed, kidneys were removed, and glomeruli were isolated by differential sieving technique. Total glycosaminoglycan and heparan sulfate synthesis was determined by incubating glomeruli in the presence of [35S]sulfate. Characterization of heparan sulfate was performed by ion-exchange chromatography. Systolic blood pressures were significantly lower in enalapril-treated diabetic rats compared to untreated diabetic rats. Diabetic glomeruli synthesized less heparan sulfate than glomeruli from nondiabetic rats. Also, glomerular heparan sulfate content of diabetics was significantly lower than that of nondiabetics. Further characterization of heparan sulfate showed that the fraction eluted with 1 M NaCl was significantly lower and the fraction eluted with 1.25 M NaCl significantly higher in diabetic than in normal rats. Enalapril treatment normalized not only glomerular synthesis and content but also various fractions of heparan sulfate in diabetic rats. Diabetic rats excreted increased quantities of heparan sulfate and albumin than nondiabetic rats. Enalapril therapy prevented both these increases in diabetic rats. These data suggest that enalapril treatment improves albuminuria through preservation of glomerular heparan sulfate and prevention of its urinary loss in diabetic rats.", 
    "214": "The effect of treatment with enalapril (10 days at 10 mg/d followed by 4 weeks at 20 mg/d) on forearm hemodynamics was assessed in eight normotensive patients and eight patients with hypertension affected by Type II diabetes as well as in eight patients with essential hypertension and normal glucose tolerance. The ACE inhibitor decreased regional vascular resistances and increased the maximum arteriolar-vasodilating capacity and venous distensibility in the three groups of patients. Thus, this study shows that ACE inhibition by enalapril improves regional hemodynamics in patients with Type II diabetes.", 
    "215": "Chorea is a rare complication of major cardiac surgery, which has been related to profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest. We describe a case of choreic syndrome in a child which followed normothermic cardiac bypass and only became apparent clinically when the child was treated with captopril.", 
    "216": "The captopril test has been suggested as a sensitive and specific noninvasive tool for the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension. We applied the test to 72 consecutive hypertensive patients in whom renal artery stenosis was suspected. The test was positive in seven cases (9.7%), of whom four were true positive and three false positive. The captopril test has value in screening for renovascular hypertension, but its limitations should be recognized. False positive results are not uncommon and false negative results have been reported under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, when properly applied to appropriate patients, the test can enhance the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.", 
    "217": "A new proteinase, which preferentially cleaves the Gln-Gly bond, was isolated from Escherichia coli. Because of this narrow specificity, the enzyme was called metalloendopeptidase QG. The proteinase is a monomer and consists of a single polypeptide chain of Mr 67,000, which is significantly smaller than the other known metalloendopeptidases of E. coli. It is found in the cytoplasm, but not in the periplasm. The enzyme cleaves the substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-Gln-Gly-Pro 2-naphthylamide between the glutamine and glycine residues, as well as its extended homologues including a nonapeptide, but it does not hydrolyse either the oxidized A and B chains of insulin or azo-casein. The pH-dependence of substrate hydrolysis gives a bell-shaped curve with pK1 = 6.6 and pK2 = 8.8. The metallopeptidase is inhibited in Tris and imidazole buffers, the basic components of which are presumably liganded to the essential Zn2+ ion. 2-Aminobenzoyl-Gln-Gly-Pro 2-naphthylamide, designed as a fluorescent substrate for the metallopeptidase, proved to be a strong inhibitor. Bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases in the micromolar concentration range, inhibits the metalloendopeptidase only in the millimolar concentration range. Captopril, the widely used inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, is a fairly good inhibitor of the metalloendopeptidase. The simplest inhibitor that can be used to protect recombinant proteins from degradation by the metalloendopeptidase may be EDTA, which is effective at low millimolar concentration.", 
    "218": "The pathophysiological consequence of targeted production of SV-40 T-antigen to renin-expressing cells in the kidney of transgenic mice is reported. A histopathologic analysis of the kidney from adult transgenic mice (12-16 wk old) revealed the presence of severe vascular lesions manifested by marked atypical hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle. The levels of plasma renin, kidney renin, and kidney renin mRNA were examined in 6- and 9-wk-old transgenic mice and were found to be significantly lower than their age-matched non-transgenic littermates and were nonresponsive to captopril treatment. However, there was no significant difference in conscious mean arterial pressure between transgenic and non-transgenic mice. The levels of renal renin mRNA in transgenics and nontransgenic littermates were compared throughout ontogeny and were found to be equal in newborns, elevated 3- to 5-fold in 1-wk-old transgenics, and yet decreased 10-fold by 6 wk of age in transgenic mice. Expression of the transgene in the kidney exhibited the proper developmental pattern and was properly restricted to juxtaglomerular cells in neonatal mice. Nevertheless, in adult mice, T-antigen-containing cells were found throughout the entire renal arterial tree. The observed ability of renal vascular cells to be recruited to express both renin and T-antigen suggests a mechanism that can explain the development of the renal pathology in these mice.",

    "220": "A randomized, open-label, parallel controlled trial was conducted. After completing a 4-week placebo phase, 79 elderly (65 years or older) patients with an average standing diastolic blood pressure (BP) 95 mm Hg or above and 114 mm Hg or less were randomized to receive a 12-week course of either labetalol or enalapril in an open-label design. The patients' BP and heart rate were evaluated biweekly by trained observers unaware of the treatment status, and drug dosage was titrated (up to 400 mg twice a day of labetalol or 40 mg daily of enalapril) to achieve a standing diastolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg and a decrease of 10 mm Hg from baseline. Patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) at the end of the placebo phase and again after 8 weeks of active treatment.", 
    "221": "The treatment groups were comparable in their reduction of supine diastolic BP, with no significant differences between the two treatments. Labetalol demonstrated a significantly greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in standing diastolic BP at the end of the titration period compared to enalapril, but this difference was not significant by the end of the study period. Based on 24-hour ABPM readings, labetalol reduced mean 24-hour diastolic BP (p less than 0.05) and mean heart rate (p less than 0.05) more than enalapril. The labetalol-treated patients were significantly less often above their diastolic BP goal throughout the 24-hour ABPM period (p less than 0.01). The two treatments were equally well tolerated.",

    "223": "The conformation of perindoprilat, an antihypertensive drug, is studied in the solid state by X-ray analysis. The resolution of its structure reveals important analogies between its observed conformation and that of several ACE inhibitors of the same family. This comparison points out a constant relative orientation of the functional groups, regardless of the molecular environment. This angular constancy appears to us as not being accidental and is a good argument for the spatial design of the ACE binding site. Although ACE is a carboxydipeptidase, the binding site may not contain two but one unique hydrophobic pocket receiving the C-terminal end of the inhibitors.",

The modified, C-terminal dipeptide portions and the phenylpropyl fragments in both crystal structures adopt similar conformations. The binding positions for several pharmacophores are defined by the constraint of the tricyclic system in the crystallographic structure of MDL27,467A hydrochloride. Conformational energy calculations show that the phenyl ring of the tetrahydro-3-isoquinoline system of quinapril does not fit into the S2 hydrophobic pocket of angiotensin converting enzyme.", 
    "225": "We encountered a renal transplant recipient who developed an unexplained 0.09 decrease in hematocrit value while taking enalapril for hypertension, which reversed when the drug was stopped. This experience, and a previous similar case report, prompted a review of all our 27 transplant patients treated with enalapril. Of these, 10 patients (37%) had developed an otherwise unaccounted for anemia: the pre-enalapril hematocrit value was 0.42 +/- 0.01 and it decreased to the nadir value of 0.33 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001) within 12.3 +/- 0.9 weeks after initiation of 9 +/- 2.4 mg of enalapril daily; enalapril was stopped in seven patients and their anemia resolved within 9.1 +/- 0.7 weeks to a final hematocrit value of 0.40 +/- 0.01. The remaining three patients were maintained on enalapril at their physicians' discretion, without further decrease in hematocrit values. No appreciable changes in drug regimens, clinical course, or other laboratory parameters were noted during this period. A causal relationship between enalapril and anemia was suggested by the effect of drug withdrawal and rechallenge on hematocrit in one of the patients. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics between those patients who did (group I) and those who did not (group II) develop enalapril-associated anemia, with the exception of a normal hematocrit value of 0.42 +/- 0.01 in group I versus a lower hematocrit value of 0.36 +/- 0.02 in group II (P less than 0.05). We conclude that enalapril should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia following renal transplantation. Susceptibility to this effect might emanate from the immunosuppressed state.", 
    "226": "Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by circulating autoantibodies directed against the keratinocyte cell surface. The two variants, pemphigus foliaceus and pemphigus vulgaris, can be distinguished at the molecular level by immunochemical studies. The large majority of patients with pemphigus develop the disease spontaneously; however, there is a small group of patients who develop pemphigus after treatment with certain medications, of which penicillamine and captopril are the best documented. Most patients with drug-induced pemphigus have circulating and/or tissue bound epidermal cell surface autoantibodies; however, the molecular specificity of these autoantibodies has not been studied. We performed immunoprecipitation studies utilizing extracts of 125I-labeled suction blister epidermis and the sera of three patients with drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus (two due to penicillamine and one due to captopril) and one patient with captopril-induced pemphigus vulgaris. We found that the three patients with drug-induced pemphigus foliaceus had circulating autoantibodies that are directed against the pemphigus foliaceus antigen complex and that the one patient with drug-induced pemphigus vulgaris had circulating autoantibodies that are directed against the pemphigus vulgaris antigen complex. This study demonstrates that autoantibodies from drug-induced pemphigus patients have the same antigenic specificity, on a molecular level, as do autoantibodies from other pemphigus patients.", 
    "227": "Treatment of female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with captopril was carried out by the addition of the drug in the drinking water throughout pregnancy and lactation and after weaning. At 28 weeks of age, average systolic blood pressure of treated SHR was 113 +/- 3 mm Hg, which was below that of control SHR (188 +/- 3 mm Hg) and WKY rats (124 +/- 3 mm Hg). Body weight and heart rate of the SHR were not affected by the treatment. Tissue level of catecholamines was increased by captopril treatment in the superior cervical ganglia but remained unchanged in the plasma, heart, mesenteric arteries, and the adrenal glands of both SHR and WKY rats. Left ventricular weight, wall thickness, and internal diameter of the left ventricle in the SHR were reduced by the treatment. Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that vascular alterations present in the control SHR were prevented by the treatment. In the superior mesenteric artery and large mesenteric artery, smaller lumen size at maximal relaxation found in the control SHR was normalized to the level of the WKY rats. Hypertrophy of the medial wall in the superior mesenteric, large and small mesenteric arteries, and an increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large mesenteric artery of the SHR were prevented by the treatment. Perfusion study of the mesenteric vascular bed showed that reactivity of these vessels to norepinephrine was reduced, and sensitivity to norepinephrine (as determined by the effective dose that causes 50% of maximal response) was increased in the SHR by captopril treatment. Sensitivity of the tail artery in response to norepinephrine was not altered by the treatment. We conclude that long-term treatment with captopril of SHR before and after birth prevented the development of hypertension, structural and functional alterations of the mesenteric arteries, and cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "228": "Renovascular hypertension is caused by two distinct conditions with different causes, fibromuscular dysplasia and atheroma. Diagnosis of the former is both simpler and more rewarding, whereas atheromatous lesions of the renal artery may be secondary to essential hypertension. It is therefore important to establish existence of functional renal ischemia as well as an anatomical lesion. Universal screening of all hypertensive patients is not recommended because of the relatively low prevalence of the disease and insufficient accuracy of available screening tests. When renovascular hypertension is clinically suspected, an oral captopril test is the most reliable office screening test. After this, digital subtraction angiography with renal vein renins or captopril renography are appropriate steps. However, the latter procedure, while promising, requires further evaluation. Duplex scanning of the renal arteries also comes into this category. Arteriography is done last, so that if renal ischemia is indicated, angioplasty can be attempted at the same time as arteriography.", 
    "229": "The acute hemodynamic effects of captopril were evaluated at cardiac catheterization in 16 children (age, 0.3-18 years) with cardiomyopathy. Twelve children had congestive cardiomyopathy, whereas four had restrictive cardiomyopathy. Hemodynamic measurements were obtained 30 and 60 minutes after the oral administration of captopril (0.5 mg/kg). Blood pressures were measured in the aorta, pulmonary artery, right atrium, and pulmonary capillary wedge position; cardiac outputs were measured by the thermodilution technique. Hemodynamic data could not be obtained after the administration of captopril in one child with congestive cardiomyopathy because of an immediate, severe hypotensive response. In 11 of 12 children with congestive cardiomyopathy, cardiac index increased by 22%, from 2.3 to 2.8 l/min/m2 (p less than 0.05), and stroke volume increased by 22%, from 23 to 28 ml/m2 (p less than 0.05). Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 32 to 21 units.m2 (p less than 0.01), but the mean aortic pressure did not change significantly. In contrast, four children with restrictive cardiomyopathy had no change in cardiac output after captopril, but there was a trend toward significant arterial hypotension (mean aortic pressure decreased from 78 to 59 mm Hg). Thus, captopril acutely reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased both cardiac output and stroke volume in children with congestive cardiomyopathy. In children with restrictive cardiomyopathy, however, captopril did not affect cardiac output, but it did decrease aortic pressure. These data indicate that captopril may benefit children with a congestive cardiomyopathy but that captopril probably should not be used in children with restrictive disease.", 
    "230": "Approximately 60 million people in the United States have hypertension. More than half are either untreated or treated without blood pressure control, despite the well-known risks of hypertension and the established benefits of treatment. The major reason for inadequate control of hypertension is poor adherence to treatment. Approximately 50% of patients with hypertension fail to keep follow-up appointments, and only 60% take their medications as prescribed. Barriers to effective therapeutic adherence include poor doctor-patient communication, cost of antihypertensive therapy, and side effects of the drugs. To increase control of hypertension, compliance with therapy must be improved. Physicians and patients must be mutually committed to achieving control of blood pressure. Physicians should communicate instructions clearly and prescribe therapies that are effective, affordable, and have minimal or no adverse effects on patient quality of life or overall cardiac risk profile. The needs of special hypertensive populations (i.e., elderly, black, and young patients) must also be recognized and addressed. Patients must follow recommendations and alert their physicians to any problems with their medications--particularly those relating to side effects and cost. When selecting drug therapy it should be noted that older patients are sensitive to volume depletion and sympathetic inhibition. In this group of patients, initial drug doses should be low and increments smaller and more gradual than in younger patients. Black patients with hypertension show an accentuated response to diuretics and blunted responses to beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as monotherapy. However, when used with a diuretic, there are no racial differences in the blood pressure lowering effects of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "231": "We studied the effects of a unique vasoactive agent, S-nitrosocaptopril (SnoCap), in an anesthetized canine preparation. We have previously demonstrated that this agent manifests the properties of both a direct nitrovasodilator and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor in vitro. The present investigation was performed to evaluate the effects of SnoCap in vivo. Intravenous administration of SnoCap produced immediate reductions in blood pressure and significantly attenuated the pressor response to angiotensin I. Equieffective doses of SnoCap had a greater duration of action after intravenous bolus administration compared with nitroglycerin (15.3 +/- 2.6 min vs. 3.2 +/- 0.5 min, respectively; P less than .01); importantly, this effect was apparent despite the relatively short plasma half-life of the compound (T1/2 alpha = 0.48 min, T1/2 beta = 5.54 min) and did not appear to be the result of inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme. Another unexpected property of SnoCap was that its nitrovasodilator effect was 10- to 30-fold less potent than nitroglycerin when administered as a bolus, but more efficacious when given by continuous infusion. These data support the view that SnoCap is a vasoactive substance with the properties of a nitrovasodilator and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, as well as the unique properties of an extended duration of action and greater potency when administered by continuous intravenous infusion than by bolus injection. The clinical utility of this compound in humans and in individuals with specific disease states remains to be demonstrated.", 
    "232": "The efficacy and tolerance of captopril was prospectively studied as monotherapy for blood hypertension (BH), as well as combined modality with thiazides diuretic and nifedipine as a third drug. 95 cases of BH were followed up for a period of 6 months. 43.15% of the patients who received monotherapy with captopril were controlled (diastolic BP less than 95 mmHg). Those patients who had a diuretic added showed a response of 71.75% and those administered 3 drugs showed a response of 81.25%. The decrease of BH was significant in all groups (p less than 0.01). There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.01) between the response to monotherapy and severity of BH (mild BH 67.50% and severe BH 35.20%). 6.5% of patients abandoned the treatment because of secondary effects. No alterations were noted in the blood test. Monotherapy with captopril is effective in control of mild and moderate BH. In resistant patients, the addition of a diuretic and nifedipine retard as a third drug is useful and well-tolerated in any type of BH severity.", 
    "233": "1. Cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is localized in high concentration in cardiac valves, coronary vessels, right and left atrium and right and left ventricle. 2. Cardiac ACE is functionally active in converting angiotension I to angiotensin II. 3. The level of cardiac ACE measured by radioinhibitor binding or by quantitative in vitro autoradiography was greatly increased after experimental myocardial infarction in the rat. The increase was greatest in the fibrous scar tissue of the free left ventricular wall infarct, but there were also significant increases in the ACE concentration in the four chambers of the heart. 4. Treatment with enalapril for 4 weeks following coronary ligation inhibited cardiac ACE, including the high levels found in the scar in the left ventricular free wall. 5. There was a close relationship between the systolic blood pressure and left ventricular mass in several models of experimental hypertension, despite varying degrees of activation of the renin-angiotensin system. However no relationship between the degree of left ventricular hypertrophy and changes in cardiac ACE could be determined. 6. Inhibition of cardiac ACE may contribute to the beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors in cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling, and may play a part in the cardioprotective role of ACE inhibitor.", 
    "234": "1. Single guinea-pig ventricular myocytes were voltage-clamped and cell length was measured with a photodiode array. 2. Captopril (1 x 10(-5) M) reduced both peak early current and active shortening in response to a depolarizing clamp pulse along a similar time course. 3. From a holding potential of around -45 mV peak early inward current was reduced by 37 +/- 9% (P less than 0.001) on exposure to captopril. The early current-voltage relationship was shifted outwards by captopril indicating a reduction in membrane conductance through the L-type calcium channel (ICa). 4. The amplitude of cell shortening in response to depolarizing voltage steps was reduced but the voltage-dependence of contraction after captopril was unchanged. 5. A small negative shift of the potential at which ICa was half-activated was observed after captopril. There was no change in the voltage-dependence of the inactivation variable or in the time-dependence of repriming for ICa. 6. The actions of captopril on ICa and developed shortening were dose-dependent and took place in the same proportion when Ica was increased by isoprenaline. 7. These results are discussed in relation to the effects of captopril on Ica and contraction and to its clinical usage.", 
    "235": "The costs and potential savings associated with switching patients in a hypertension clinic from enalapril maleate to lisinopril were analyzed. Patients taking enalapril were randomized to receive lisinopril or to continue taking enalapril. For the 47 patients randomized, data were collected for 25 patients switched to an equal milligram dosage of lisinopril and for 21 patients who continued to receive a constant dosage of enalapril. To maintain blood pressure control, it was necessary to double the dosage of lisinopril in five patients (20%) and have it in one patient (4%), while the enalapril dosage was doubled in two patients (9.5%). The total direct cost of switching patients to lisinopril was $66.33 per patient. The annual drug cost savings per patient for switching to lisinopril would be $52.08, $46.80, and $120.24 for therapy with one 5-, 10-, and 20-mg tablet per day, respectively. A patient would have to receive 15, 17, or 7 months of therapy with 5-, 10-, or 20-mg tablets of lisinopril, respectively, before a net cost savings would be realized. In the evaluation of a less expensive therapeutic alternative, the total cost of switching must be considered.", 
    "236": "An open, randomized, cross-over study was undertaken to assess the effects of lisinopril and nifedipine on albumin excretion, renal haemodynamics and segmental tubular reabsorption in overt diabetic nephropathy. The study consisted of a 4-week run-in period, a 3-week active treatment period, a 4-week wash-out period and a second 3-week active treatment period. Twelve patients with type 1 diabetes with albuminuria, mild to moderate hypertension and a serum creatinine level of less than 200 mumol l-1 were included. Lisinopril reduced albumin excretion from 1343 +/- 337 micrograms min-1 to 879 +/- 299 micrograms min-1 (P less than 0.01), whereas nifedipine was without effect, 1436 +/- 336 micrograms min-1 vs. 1319 +/- 342 micrograms min-1. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was unchanged by either drug. Both drugs increased effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) by about 20%. No differences between the drugs were observed with regard to their effect on renal haemodynamic parameters. By contrast, nifedipine exerted an inhibitory effect on several proximal tubular transport markers, whereas lisinopril was without effect. The different actions on tubular transport mechanisms exerted by lisinopril and nifedipine may contribute to the observed effect on albumin excretion.", 
    "237": "We measured the concentrations of three principal products of the renin-angiotensin system and seven of their metabolites in the plasma of anesthetized normal dogs and in dogs 24 hours after bilateral nephrectomy. The levels of the angiotensin peptides were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with radioimmunoassay using three specific antibodies that recognized different epitotes in the sequences of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin-(1-7). The analysis revealed that angiotensin-(1-7) is present in the plasma of intact (4.9 +/- 2.2 fmol/ml) and nephrectomized (0.5 +/- 0.5 fmol/ml) dogs. An intravenous injection of purified hog renin (0.01 Goldblatt unit/kg) increased plasma levels of angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and angiotensin-(1-7) both before and after nephrectomy. These changes were associated with parallel increases in the concentrations of fragments of the three parent peptides. Administration of MK-422 led to the disappearance of circulating angiotensin II and its fragments both before and after a second injection of the same dose of renin. In contrast, MK-422 augmented the plasma levels of both angiotensin I and angiotensin-(1-7). The concentrations of these two peptides, but not the blood pressure, were again augmented by a second injection of renin given after blockade of converting enzyme. These effects were observed both before and after bilateral nephrectomy. These findings show that angiotensin-(1-7) circulates in the blood of normal and nephrectomized dogs. In addition, we found that angiotensin-(1-7) is generated in the blood from the cleavage of angiotensin I through a pathway independent of converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1).", 
    "238": "Acute lethal cocaine intoxication in the rat induces significant increases of plasma dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine concentrations associated with cardiac functional and morphologic changes. Nitrendipine (a calcium channel antagonist) administered 5 min following cocaine administration lowers catecholamine concentration and restores cardiovascular function to normal, while preventing lethality, and so does enalaprilat (an enzyme-converting inhibitor) administration with diazepam. Cocaine cardiac toxicity in the rat appears to be associated with a significant stimulation of the sympathoadrenal and a sustained elevated plasma concentration of epinephrine. The renin angiotensin system also appears to be activated.", 
    "239": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is found in the adrenal gland, but the role of adrenal ACE in the formation of angiotensin II (AII) and subsequent stimulation of aldosterone is unclear. We examined the effect of adrenal ACE activity on aldosterone secretion by superfusing rat adrenal capsules with angiotensin I (AI) in the presence and absence of the ACE inhibitor, lisinopril. Angiotensin I (10 microM) stimulated aldosterone secretion from 914 +/- 41 to 1465 +/- 118 pg/min/capsule (P less than 0.05). Simultaneous superfusion of AI plus lisinopril (100 microM) inhibited the stimulation of aldosterone by 73% (P less than 0.05). Perfusion of the capsules with angiotensin II (1 microM) stimulated aldosterone from 893 +/- 180 to 1466 +/- 181 pg/min/capsule (P less than 0.01). In contrast, simultaneous superfusion of AII plus lisinopril (100 microM) did not inhibit the AII stimulation of aldosterone. The failure of lisinopril to inhibit AII stimulation of aldosterone argues against a toxic or nonspecific action of lisinopril. The inhibition of AI stimulation of aldosterone release by lisinopril is mostly due to lisinopril inhibition of ACE and resulting decreased conversion of AI to AII. These results demonstrate that adrenal ACE may generate AII from AI in the adrenal gland, and this locally produce AII stimulates aldosterone.", 
    "240": "The long-term effects of perindopril or chlorothiazide therapy were studied in rats after the induction of myocardial infarction by coronary artery ligation. Rats with infarction developed marked cardiomegaly, indicating the presence of chronic left ventricular dysfunction. The ratio of the norepinephrine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylene glycol (DHPG) to norepinephrine (NE) was elevated in the right ventricle of rats with infarction, suggesting a chronic increase in cardiac sympathetic activity. Perindopril therapy commenced either immediately following infarction or 4 weeks following infarction reduced DHPG/NE ratios toward normal levels, and prevented or reversed cardiac hypertrophy. In contrast, chlorothiazide therapy significantly reduced DHPG/NE ratios but did not decrease cardiac hypertrophy. Perindopril reverses or prevents cardiac hypertrophy and chronic cardiac sympathetic hyperactivity following myocardial infarction, while chlorothiazide reduces cardiac sympathetic activity without influencing cardiomegaly.", 
    "241": "M-mode echocardiograms were recorded in 22 Type 1 diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (n = 10) or early persistent proteinuria (n = 12). Eight (36%) had both an increased left ventricular mass (males greater than 131 g m-2; females greater than 100 g m-2) and a systolic blood pressure above the 75th centile of the normal blood pressure distribution. These eight patients were treated with antihypertensive drugs, predominantly enalapril, for 1 year. Echocardiograms were repeated after 3 and 12 months. Systolic blood pressure at recruitment was 155 +/- 14 (+/- SD) mmHg, and was significantly lower after 3 months (146 +/- 12 mmHg; p less than 0.05) and 12 months (139 +/- 8 mmHg; p less than 0.005). Diastolic blood pressure did not change significantly. Both intraventricular septal width and left ventricular posterior wall thickness fell progressively and were significantly lower after 12 months treatment (15.0 +/- 2.7 vs 13.0 +/- 2.6 mm, and 10.3 +/- 1.9 vs 8.8 +/- 1.3 mm; both p less than 0.05). Left ventricular mass index was 148 +/- 29 g m-2 at recruitment, but lower after 3 months (131 +/- 25 g m-2; p less than 0.05) and 12 months (132 +/- 26 g m-2; p less than 0.005) antihypertensive therapy.", 
    "242": "Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist with a high degree of selectivity for the coronary, cerebral, and skeletal muscle vasculature. The drug has minimal depressant activity on sinoatrial node automaticity and negligible negative chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic actions. Isradipine reduces blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance without changes in cardiac output and stroke volume. Renal blood flow is maintained while renal vascular resistance is reduced; this is accompanied by both short- and long-term diuretic and natriuretic effects. Doses of 1.25 to 5 mg twice daily lowers blood pressure effectively over 24 h. In open as well as placebo-controlled trials, 2.5 to 10 mg isradipine twice daily was safe and well tolerated, and reduced systolic and diastolic values in up to 85% of patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Efficacy is similar to those of nifedipine and nitrendipine, and potentially superior to those of propranolol, atenolol, prazosin, hydrochlorothiazide, and diltiazem. The drug can be safely combined with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and diuretics. Adverse effects are dose-dependent and secondary to arterial vasodilatation, such as headache, flushing, ankle edema, dizziness, palpitations, and tachycardia. At the recommended dose of 2.5 mg twice daily, the total incidence of side effects does not differ from that with placebo. The antiatherosclerotic, antitrophic, and cerebroprotective effects seen in experimental animal models are promising for the drug in the treatment of human hypertension. Isradipine may not only reduce blood pressure, but may also reduce the risk for the consequences of this peril, namely, cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction.", 
    "243": "This multicenter trial compared the efficacy and safety of isradipine and enalapril in 160 patients with essential hypertension. Patients received isradipine or enalapril for 10 weeks after a placebo wash-out period of three to five weeks. Dosage was titrated for six weeks on the basis of blood pressure (BP) response and was then maintained for the remainder of the study. Isradipine reduced systolic and diastolic BP by 12 and 9 mm Hg, respectively, and enalapril by 10 and 7 mm Hg, respectively (between-treatment difference P less than .05 for diastolic BP). Overall, isradipine resulted in a higher responder rate, particularly among patients who had higher entry BPs. Fifteen enalapril-treated patients and four isradipine-treated patients discontinued treatment (four taking enalapril and none taking isradipine withdrew because of lack of efficacy). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, and edema in the isradipine group, and cough, headache, and chest pain in the enalapril group. Both drugs produced significant reductions in BP, but, in this study isradipine was more effective. The drugs were similarly well tolerated.", 
    "244": "The antihypertensive effects of isradipine and captopril were studied in 140 patients (70 men) with mild-to-moderate hypertension, aged 26 to 74 years, in a double-blind, randomized, between-patient comparative trial. Initial treatment started with 1.25 mg isradipine twice daily or 12.5 mg captopril twice daily. If normotension was not achieved after four weeks, doses were increased to 2.5 mg twice daily or 25 mg twice daily, respectively. If the maximum dose as monotherapy did not result in normotension, captopril (12.5 mg or, if necessary, 25 mg twice daily) was added to regimens of the isradipine-treated patients or isradipine (1.25 mg or, if necessary, 2.5 mg twice daily) was given in addition to the captopril-treated patients. After 24 weeks of active treatment, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced (P less than .001) with isradipine (from 168 +/- 18 to 144 +/- 14 mm Hg) and with captopril (from 168 +/- 20 to 143 +/- 10 mm Hg). Diastolic blood pressure also fell significantly (P less than .001) in both groups (isradipine: from 105 +/- 5 to 84 +/- 5 mm Hg; captopril; from 105 +/- 4 to 85 +/- 4 mm Hg). With isradipine as monotherapy, diastolic blood pressure was normalized in 49% of patients compared with 56% with captopril as monotherapy (P = NS). Combining both drugs resulted in an increased rate of normalization (to 87%). The results indicate that combined treatment with a calcium antagonist and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor is effective in lowering blood pressure and is well tolerated during long-term therapy.", 
    "245": "To elucidate the effect of natriuretic and antinatriuretic factors on the excretion of an intravenous sodium load, we observed the natriuretic responses of 12 patients with essential hypertension (EHT) and 7 age- and sex-matched normotensive (NT) subjects following the intravenous administration of 1500 mL of normal saline over a 3 h period. After saline infusion, both groups showed increases in urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). The increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and urinary dopamine excretion (UDAV) and the suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) were similar in both groups. However, no significant change in blood pressure (BP) was seen in either group. Since significant negative linear correlations between the basal level of PRA and percent change in UNaV or GFR were seen only in EHT, we observed the influence of suppressing the renin-angiotensin system with a converting enzyme inhibitor. After a 7 day treatment with enalapril, GFR and UNaV in EHT after saline infusion were comparable to data obtained in the absence of enalapril, despite a reduction in preexpansion BP. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the basal BP and the percent increase in UNaV was seen among EHT after enalapril treatment. These results suggest that the state of the renin-angiotensin system is important in renal sodium excretion in EHT.", 
    "246": "The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, after treatment for 5-6 weeks with 25 mg t.i.d., were studied in 12 patients with stable moderate heart failure. Five patients received placebo treatment, and the two groups were comparable at baseline. Angiotensin II levels decreased in response to captopril therapy. Skeletal muscle potassium, magnesium and chloride levels did not differ from reference values. Calcium was subnormal (P less than 0.0001), but increased to the reference range during captopril treatment. Phosphofructokinase, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, was in the lower reference range and increased (P less than 0.04) in response to captopril therapy. In conclusion, stable moderate heart failure is associated with low levels of skeletal muscle calcium and phosphofructokinase activity, these metabolic changes tending to return to normal levels with captopril treatment.", 
    "247": "The systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of arginine vasopressin receptor antagonism (AVPA) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEi) were examined in rabbits with acute left ventricular failure induced by repetitive direct current (DC) shock. Hemodynamic measurements in 24 rabbits 24 h after DC shock compared with 6 sham-operated controls demonstrated a lowered cardiac output (602 +/- 26 vs. 920 +/- 35 ml/min, P less than 0.01), increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP, 13.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.5 mmHg, P less than 0.01) and a raised peripheral resistance (9,734 +/- 495 vs. 6,479 +/- 305 dyn.s.cm-5, P less than 0.01). Cerebral blood flow was not altered in rabbits with acute left ventricular failure but intestinal (29 +/- 2 vs. 53 +/- 9 ml/min, P less than 0.01) and renal (82 +/- 6 vs. 130 +/- 8 ml/min, P less than 0.01) blood flows were significantly reduced. No hemodynamic changes were observed after AVPA alone in the acute heart failure group and ACEi alone reduced LVEDP and increased renal vascular conductance. Treatment with both drugs (i.e., AVPA + ACEi) resulted in a significant increase in cardiac output (21%) and a decrease in blood pressure (19%) and peripheral resistance (34%) and restored renal and intestinal blood flows to near normal levels. Thus both vasopressin and angiotensin contribute to the overall increase in peripheral resistance in this model and to the decrease in intestinal and renal blood flow observed. Presumably blockade of one system produced little hemodynamic change because of compensatory increases in the other system.", 
    "248": "To study the effect of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) on airway ciliary motility, we measured ciliary beat frequency by a photoelectric method in response to ANF in cultured tracheal epithelial cells from rabbits. Addition of ANF but not [Tyr8]ANF-(5-27) decreased ciliary beat frequency in a dose-dependent fashion; the maximal decrease from the baseline value was 24.1 +/- 1.5% (+/- SE, P less than 0.001), and a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 3 x 10(-12) M. Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase activity by phosphoramidon (10(-6) M) or thiorphan (10(-6) M) potentiated the effect of ANF so that the dose-response curve for ANF was shifted to lower concentrations by approximately 0.5 log units (P less than 0.05, in each case). The inhibition of ciliary motility induced by ANF was not affected by the blockade of arachidonic acid metabolism with indomethacin, piroxicam, or nordihydroguaiaretic acid, but it was blocked by methylene blue, a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, and was potentiated by M & B 22948, a guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase inhibitor. The intracellular cGMP levels were increased by ANF, an effect that was further potentiated by phosphoramidon or thiorphan. These results suggest that ANF inhibits ciliary motility presumably through a guanylate cyclase-dependent regulatory pathway and that neutral endopeptidase may play a role in modulating the ANF effect on airway mucociliary transport function.", 
    "249": "The adjunctive use of intravenous captopril with tissue plasminogen activator early during acute myocardial infarction offers theoretic advantages of diminishing left ventricular volume, preventing ventricular dilation and improving patient survival. To test the safety and efficacy of combined early administration of intravenous captopril and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), 38 patients treated with rt-PA 3 +/- 0.3 h (mean +/- SE) after the onset of myocardial infarction were randomized to intravenous followed by oral captopril or placebo therapy. They underwent cardiac catheterization with measurement of hemodynamic variables and left ventricular function and determination of serum renin, angiotensin and aldosterone levels on days 1 and 7. Oral administration of the selected agent was continued for 3 months along with other antianginal medications, including nonangiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor vasodilators. Repeat measurements of left ventricular function were obtained before hospital discharge and at 3 months. There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between groups. One patient in the captopril-treated group became hypotensive during intravenous therapy, requiring discontinuation of treatment. Compared with the placebo-treated group, the captopril-treated group had significant reductions at day 7 in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (22.5 +/- 1.5 versus 16.3 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and mean systemic arterial pressure (93.6 +/- 3.3 versus 86.2 +/- 2.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "250": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical and renal hemodynamic effects of cilazapril in 10 hypertensive patients with moderate-to-severe chronic renal failure (creatinine clearance 14-50 ml/min). After 2 weeks of placebo, cilazapril 0.5 mg/day was given, and the dose was increased up to 5 mg/day if sitting diastolic blood pressure (SDBP) was not normalized (less than or equal to 90 mm Hg). Once a normal SDBP value was achieved, the patients remained on the given dose regimen for 6 months. After this period SDBP decreased from 107 +/- 2 to 95 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). At the end of treatment, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained unchanged in five patients, improved in four patients, and slightly decreased in one patient, the slope from baseline being 0.137 and the variation of GFR per unit of GFR at baseline being between -0.20 and 0.47. Likewise, effective renal plasma flow increased not significantly, showing considerable variability. Urinary protein excretion was reduced significantly from 2.51 +/- 0.75 to 0.51 +/- 0.10 g/L (p less than 0.05), suggesting that converting enzyme inhibition may exert a renal protective effect. In conclusion, it appears that cilazapril does not induce functional damage in the kidney of predialysis hypertensives.", 
    "251": "Postischemic myocardial dysfunction in canine myocardium has been reported to be reduced by scavengers of oxygen-derived free radicals. One potential source of oxygen-derived free radicals in canine myocardium is xanthine oxidase, but human and rabbit myocardium either lack or possess very low levels of this enzyme. Therefore, the effects of scavengers of oxygen-derived free radicals on postischemic myocardial dysfunction produced by 15 min of ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion were evaluated in vivo in the rabbit. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (45,000 U/kg) and catalase (55,000 U/kg) were given into the left atrium 10 min before ischemia, and followed by an additional 45,000 U/kg of SOD and 55,000 U/kg of catalase given over 85 min. This treatment reduced postischemic myocardial dysfunction, as did sulfhydryl-containing free radical scavengers N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine (4 mg/kg, i.v.) and captopril (3 mg/kg, i.v.) given 5 min before and 60 min after reperfusion. SOD given alone at the same dose was ineffective, as was enalaprilat (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that does not scavenge oxygen-derived free radicals. Thus, postischemic myocardial dysfunction was reduced by scavengers of oxygen-derived free radicals in vivo in a species that is deficient in myocardial xanthine oxidase. This suggests that oxygen-derived free radicals derived from a source other than xanthine oxidase play a role in postischemic myocardial dysfunction.", 
    "252": "There are reports of an increase in renin release after the administration of fenoldopam which probably results from the activation of dopamine (DA)-1 receptors located on juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney. However, the functional significance of this finding in terms of modulating the tubular response to DA-1 receptor stimulation remains to be determined. In this study we have examined the effect of an increase in renin-angiotensin system activity during the administration of fenoldopam on the natriuretic and diuretic action of this compound. Intravenous infusion of fenoldopam (0.5 microgram/kg/min) for 30 min produced significant increases in urine output and urinary sodium excretion without causing any changes in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow and mean arterial blood pressure, a phenomenon suggestive of a direct tubular site of action. In animals treated with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, both the diuretic and natriuretic effects of fenoldopam were potentiated markedly. In comparison with fenoldopam infusion in control animals, urine output, urinary sodium excretion and potassium excretion increased by approximately 4-fold (375 +/- 24 vs. 97 +/- 3 microliters/30 min, P less than .01), 9-fold (50 +/- 5 vs. 6 +/- 1 microEq/30 min, P less than .001) and 2-fold (46 +/- 8 vs. 24 +/- 2 microEq/30 min, P less than .05), respectively, in animals receiving a bolus injection of captopril (1 mg/kg i.v.) 30 min before onset of fenoldopam infusion. Whereas no significant changes in renal blood flow occurred when fenoldopam was given to control rats, in animals treated with captopril, fenoldopam produced a modest but significant increase in renal blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "253": "The objective of treating patients with hypertension is not simply to reduce blood pressure but rather to prevent the associated morbidity and mortality. Recent assessments of clinical trials have shown that while the risk of stroke is consistently lower with antihypertensive therapy, the same degree of success has not been demonstrated for coronary artery disease (CAD). Although there are many explanations of why we have not done as well in preventing CAD, one possibility is that the therapy used in clinical trials, primarily thiazide diuretics and beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, has increased the patient's risk of developing coronary atherosclerosis or lethal arrhythmias. Four classes of antihypertensive agents are recommended for initial therapy--thiazide diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium entry blockers. The metabolic effects of thiazide diuretics include electrolyte disturbances (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyponatremia), dyslipidemia (increased triglycerides), abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance), and hyperuricemia. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers have many of the same metabolic adverse reactions. beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) also cause dyslipidemias (lowered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased triglycerides) and abnormalities of glucose metabolism (hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and peripheral insulin resistance). beta-Adrenoreceptor blockers with ISA and third-generation beta-blockers with selective partial agonist activity (celiprolol and dilevalol) do not cause dyslipidemia and to date do not appear to induce abnormalities in glucose metabolism. ACE inhibitors may decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and captopril may improve insulin sensitivity. Calcium entry blockers are metabolically neutral.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "254": "The factors to be considered in selecting antihypertensive agents have traditionally centered around balancing efficacy against adverse side effects. The former can be achieved by a variety of agents alone or in combination. The latter not only involves safety but is also concerned with whether an otherwise safe agent is tolerated by the patient so compliance with the treatment regimen can be achieved. A relatively new consideration is how antihypertensive agents affect other disease states that may or may not be associated with hypertension. For example, how a drug may affect diabetes, gout, myocardial hypertrophy, atherosclerosis, and coronary events must be evaluated. These concerns taken together answer the question of why yet another antihypertensive agent may be needed in the pharmacologic armamentarium.", 
    "255": "The physiological importance of interactions between angiotensin II and sympathetic neurotransmission was studied in an in vivo model with constant flow blood perfused gracilis muscle in situ in dogs pretreated with desipramine and atropine. Sympathetic nerve stimulation-(2 and 8 Hz, 480 pulses) evoked over-flow of endogenous noradrenaline and vasoconstriction, and vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous noradrenaline (0.5 nmol, locally i.a.) were evaluated. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition by benazeprilat (10 mg i.v.; n = 8) reduced arterial angiotensin II levels from 26 +/- 8 to 2 +/- 1 pM and reduced mean arterial and basal muscle perfusion pressures. Subsequent resubstitution of angiotensin II (3, 30 and 90 ng kg-1 min-1 i.v.) elevated arterial angiotensin II dose-dependently (to 67 +/- 14, 622 +/- 63 and 1940 +/- 251 pM, respectively), as well as mean arterial and muscle perfusion pressures. Nerve stimulation-evoked noradrenaline overflow was unchanged following benazeprilat (-4 +/- 4 and +1 +/- 8% at 2 and 8 Hz, respectively) and during subsequent infusions of angiotensin II. Vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation and exogenous noradrenaline were also uninfluenced by these treatments. Thus, angiotensin II did not enhance sympathetic neurotransmission at the postjunctional level. Another group of animals was pretreated with noncompetitive alpha-adrenoceptor blockade locally by phenoxybenzamine and benextramine (0.5 mg kg-1 i.a. of each; n = 7), which abolished vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation. The effects of benazeprilat and subsequent angiotensin II infusions (3 and 30 ng kg-1 min-1 i.v.) on circulating angiotensin II levels, mean arterial and muscle perfusion pressures were similar in this group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

There was no evidence of a pharmacokinetic interaction between agents. The concentration-time profiles remained unaltered by coadministration of both agents. 4. Plasma ACE inhibition by ramiprilat was unaffected by concurrent felodipine. The trend towards increased fractional sodium excretion after felodipine was not influenced by ramipril. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone and catecholamines remained unaltered. 5. Combination therapy produced a statistically significant fall in blood pressure supine and erect which was not evident with monotherapy. The reflex tachycardia associated with felodipine monotherapy was significantly attenuated by the coadministration of ramipril. 6.

    "265": "Bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, was also a potent inhibitor of leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase. On isolated enzyme its effects were immediate and reversible with a Ki = 201 +/- 95 mM. With erythrocytes it inhibited LTB4 formation greater than 90% within 10 min; with neutrophils it inhibited LTB4 formation by only 10% during the same period, increasing to 40% in 2 h. Bestatin inhibited LTA4 hydrolase selectively; neither 5-lipoxygenase nor 15-lipoxygenase activity in neutrophil lysates was affected. Purified LTA4 hydrolase exhibited an intrinsic aminopeptidase activity, hydrolyzing L-lysine-p-nitroanilide and L-leucine-beta-naphthylamide with apparent Km = 156 microM and 70 microM and Vmax = 50 and 215 nmol/min/mg, respectively. Both LTA4 and bestatin suppressed the intrinsic aminopeptidase activity of LTA4 hydrolase with apparent Ki values of 5.3 microM and 172 nM, respectively. Other metallohydrolase inhibitors tested did not reduce LTA4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase activity, with one exception; captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, was as effective as bestatin. The results demonstrate a functional resemblance between LTA4 hydrolase and certain metallohydrolases, consistent with a molecular resemblance at their putative Zn2(+)-binding sites. The availability of a reversible, chemically stable inhibitor of LTA4 hydrolase may facilitate investigations on the role of LTB4 in inflammation, particularly the process termed transcellular biosynthesis.",

    "267": "Potassium channel activators (PCAs) open the membrane potassium channels, thus increasing the cell potassium efflux. This results in hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, the main result of which is a reduction of the penetration of calcium into cells. The resulting decrease of intracellular Ca++ produces relaxation of the smooth muscle fibres, notably in blood vessels. In animals, PCAs reduce total peripheral resistance and lower blood pressure. These vasodilator and hypotensive effects are accompanied by reflex tachycardia and stimulation of the renin-angiotensin system and they are antagonized by glibenclamide, an antagonist of ATP-dependent potassium channels. Very recent experimental data have shown that in the ischaemic myocardium PCAs tend to improve the balance between oxygen supply and demand and to exert a cardioprotective effect. Up to now, the only use of PCAs has been in arterial hypertension, and the only drugs used are pinacidil, minoxidil and diazoxide. Unfortunately, the PCAs that are available at present are rather poorly tolerated, which limits their development in this particular field. However, their combination with beta-blockers and/or diuretics reduces the incidence of their side-effects and improves their effectiveness. A synergistic effect between PCAs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is probable.",

Total airway injury scores (mean +/- S.D.) were 1.2 +/- 0.7 for ENP-Hi, 0.2 +/- 0.2 for ENP-Lo, and 21.3 +/- 16 for group C. Enalaprilat minimizes NTB lesions in neonatal piglets exposed to high frequency oscillatory ventilation. Although the origin of NTB is multifactorial, airway mucosa ischemia may play an important role. Enalaprilat may compensate for the reduction of mucosal blood flow by limiting formation of angiotensin II and/or preventing degradation of bradykinin.", 
    "269": "Hypertension was produced in cynomolgus monkeys by reducing blood flow to the left kidney by 60% via renal artery stenosis (2-kidney, 1-clip). Significant increases in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were observed within two to three weeks. Maximum increase (from 95 +/- 6 mmHg to 130 +/- 7 mmHg) occurred at about four to six weeks following renal artery stenosis and was sustained for more than 24 weeks. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was elevated concomitantly with the increase in MABP. PRA was raised to 42 +/- 3 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr six weeks after renal artery stenosis from a control PRA of 3 +/- 0.7 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr. At six months post renal artery stenosis, PRA was 33.4 +/- 4.2 ng angiotensin I/ml/hr. The angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonist saralasin, the angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor captopril, and the renin inhibitor CGP 38,560 produced sustained reductions in MABP. The antihypertensive response to the renin inhibitor CGP 38,560 was associated with a reduction in PRA of greater than 99%, and a greater than 90% reduction in immunoreactive AII. These studies demonstrate that high-renin hypertension can be induced in the cynomolgus monkey. This pathological model provides a useful method for investigating the antihypertensive effects of agents which antagonize the renin-angiotensin system in a nonhuman primate.", 
    "270": "The evaluation and treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient with an elevated blood pressure presents a diagnostic challenge. We are less able to rely on young age and resistance to treatment as indications for more extensive evaluation of secondary causes of hypertension; thus, greater reliance on history, physical examination, and clinical judgment is required if we are to identify potentially treatable causes. The treatment of hypertension in the African-American patient also presents a therapeutic challenge. Thiazide diuretics remain the drugs of first choice for treating hypertension in the African-American hypertensive. The calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are attractive alternatives to thiazides in patients uncontrolled by or intolerant of thiazides or who have specific indications for these agents (eg, angina, severe diastolic dysfunction). Beta-blockers should not be denied to African-American hypertensives if indications for their use exist. Although beta-blockers may be less effective as monotherapy, 50% of African-American hypertensives can be so controlled. Resistance to beta-blockers may be eliminated by administering them with a diuretic. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), like CCBs, are well tolerated, but also lack long-term primary prevention data. As is the case with beta-blockers, ACEIs are less effective in African-American hypertensives when used as monotherapy. ACEIs have particular value in therapy for African-American hypertensives with concomitant congestive heart failure and may protect against progression of diabetic nephropathy. Finally, all hypertensives, especially African-American hypertensives, should have access to treatment prior to the development of end organ damage. The cost of early intervention is minimal compared with the economic consequences of neglect.", 
    "271": "Two studies were undertaken to investigate the effects of acute (Study 1) or repeated (Study 2) administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril on the cognitive deficits produced by scopolamine administration in volunteers. Enalapril at doses between 2.5 and 10.0 mg p.o. produced virtually complete blockade of plasma ACE activity. However, it did not influence the effects of scopolamine on a variety of cognitive tasks, including tests of memory, attention and sedation.", 
    "272": "A double-blind, parallel, comparative study of the antihypertensive efficacy and safety of once-daily oral doses of amlodipine (5-10 mg/day) vs. twice-daily oral doses of captopril (25-50 mg twice daily) in adult patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension (supine diastolic blood pressure of 95-115 mm Hg) was undertaken in two hospital centers. Interim analysis of data from 40 patients shows that amlodipine and captopril both significantly (p < 0.05) reduced blood pressure compared with baseline. Nineteen of 21 (90.5%) amlodipine-treated patients and 15 of 19 (78.9%) captopril-treated patients had their diastolic blood pressure \"normalized\" (< 90 mm Hg) with mean final doses of 8.2 and 76.7 mg/day, respectively. At the final visit, there were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in either mean supine or standing blood pressure. Minor nonsignificant changes in standing heart rate were observed in both treatment groups. Seven of the 21 amlodipine-treated patients and 3 of the 19 captopril-treated patients reported adverse experiences. No patients in either treatment group discontinued due to adverse events; one patient in the amlodipine group required a dose reduction. These interim data indicate that the overall efficacy and safety profiles of these two drugs are comparable.", 
    "273": "The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of amlodipine in combination with enalapril were assessed in this two-center study. Patients with moderate to severe hypertension and with diastolic blood pressure > 95 mm Hg after 4 weeks of treatment with open-label enalapril 5-10 mg daily were randomized to receive amlodipine 10 mg daily or placebo, double-blind for a further 4 weeks, in combination with open-label enalapril. There were significantly larger falls in mean supine and standing blood pressure in patients treated with enalapril plus amlodipine than in those treated with enalapril plus placebo. There was no clinically or statistically significant difference between treatment groups in pulse rate, ECG, or body weight. Side effects were generally mild or moderate with a similar incidence in both treatment groups. The study showed once-daily amlodipine to be effective and well tolerated when administered as add-on therapy to enalapril.", 
    "274": "In order to validate the captopril test for identification of patients with renovascular hypertension (RVH), we performed the test with 118 patients suspected of suffering from RVH who were receiving antihypertensive medication. On the basis of 44 patients with proven RVH and 74 patients with primary hypertension (PH), the sensitivity, specificity and posterior probability for the captopril test were calculated separately for patients undergoing and not undergoing diuretic therapy. An absolute rise in plasma renin activity (PRA) and a relative rise in PRA served as discriminating indicators. The absolute increase of PRA after captopril administration in the absence of long-term therapy with diuretics yielded the best posterior probability in the one-dimensional model, with a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 97%. Linking of the variables \"absolute\" and \"relative rise of PRA\" reduced the misclassification rate to 5%. This validation allows an accurate distinction between RVH and PH on the basis of the captopril test even when antihypertensive therapy is not suspended (except for ACE inhibitors and diuretics).", 
    "275": "It is proposed that the systemic hyperinsulinemia and hepatic portal hypoinsulinemia that occurs with conventional injectable preparations of insulin currently used in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus is largely responsible for the morbidity associated with this disease. Epidemiological evidence and animal experimentation strongly support systemic hyperinsulinemia as a major factor in genesis of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. In addition, in vitro studies demonstrate a direct effect of insulin on endothelial cell and arterial smooth muscle proliferation. On the other hand, inadequate hepatic delivery of insulin is associated with overproduction of renal vasoregulatory factors leading to glomerular hyperfiltration and ultimately to glomerulosclerosis and its clinical endpoint--end-stage renal disease. In the absence of widespread success of pancreatic and islet-cell transplantation as a means to deliver insulin physiologically into the hepatic portal circulation, methods must be devised and perfected to accomplish such delivery using approaches such as orally administering insulin in intestinal-enzyme protected capsules. Until such methods of delivery are available for safe and widespread use, one should abandon the illusory goal of rigid glucose control in favor of methods that reduce insulin requirement. Along these lines, dietary restriction and aerobic exercise should be the major life style changes advised for diabetic patients. Reduction of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetic patients can be promoted with the use of low protein diets and/or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "276": "1. Streptozotocin diabetic rats were treated with captopril (50 mg l), an angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitor, in drinking water for 20 weeks. 2. Systolic blood pressure and 24-hr urinary excretions of heparan sulfate and albumin were done at 2, 8, 16 and 20 weeks. 3. At the end of 20 weeks, all rats were killed, kidneys removed and glomeruli isolated. 4. Total glycosaminoglycan and heparan sulfate synthesis were determined by incubating glomeruli in the presence of 35S-sulfate. 5. Captopril significantly lowered blood pressure in diabetic rats 8 weeks after treatment. 6. Diabetic glomeruli synthesized less total glycosaminoglycan and heparan sulfate than glomeruli from nondiabetic rats. 7. Further characterization of heparan sulfate by ion-exchange chromatography showed that the fraction eluted with 1 M NaCl was significantly lower and the fraction eluted with 1.25 M NaCl significantly higher in diabetic than in normal rats. 8. Therapy with captopril normalized not only glomerular synthesis and content but also various fractions of heparan sulfate in diabetic rats. 9. Excretions of heparan sulfate and albumin were significantly higher in diabetic than in nondiabetic rats. 10. Captopril therapy did significantly lower but not normalize both these excretions in diabetic rats. 11. The data suggest that catopril therapy improves albuminuria through preservation of glomerular heparan sulfate and prevention of its urinary loss in diabetic rats.", 
    "277": "We studied, by 48-hour Holter monitoring, 33 patients with chronic stable heart failure (radionuclide ejection fraction less than 35%), complex ventricular arrhythmias and no electrolyte abnormalities, after a period during which they were treated with digoxin and diuretics. Before Holter monitoring blood samples were analyzed for serum concentration of sodium, potassium, magnesium, urea, creatinine, digoxin, aldosterone and for plasmatic renin activity in addition to urinary aldosterone and catecholamines determination. After these investigations in 23 patients, 5-20 mg of enalapril were progressively added to the conventional therapy, while 10 patients continued the previous therapy. After 8 weeks 30 patients were subjected to a second 48-hour Holter monitoring and to the same biochemical and hormonal tests. One patient died and 2 were lost to follow up. Only the enalapril group showed a significant decrease in the number of premature ventricular complexes (PVC) (p less than 0.01), and the frequency of couplets and episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) declined significantly (P less than 0.01). In the two groups there were no significant changes in digoxin, sodium, or magnesium, while potassium concentration increased in both groups (p less than 0.01). In the enalapril group heart rate and systolic and diastolic pressure declined significantly (p less than 0.01), and New York Heart Association class (NYHA) improved (p less than 0.001). In the other group there were no significant changes in these parameters. Enalapril caused a significant increase in the plasmatic renin activity (p less than 0.01) and a significant fall of plasma and urinary aldosterone (p less than 0.01; p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "283": "This study compared enalapril maleate (Enaprin) as a single antihypertensive agent and enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide in Korean patients to determine if one regimen is superior to the other in terms of efficacy and subjective adverse effects. After a 1-week washout period, 12 patients were randomized to receive enalapril 10 mg daily and 13 patients to receive enalapril 10 mg daily plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily. After 2 weeks, enalapril was increased to 20 mg daily if diastolic blood pressure was greater than 90 mm Hg. The study period was 12 weeks. The mean changes in diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg were enalapril alone -10.7 +/- 10.5 mm Hg and enalapril plus hydrochlorothiazide -25.1 +/- 12.1 mm Hg (difference between the two groups significant at p less than 0.01). Mean dose of enalapril required to achieve goal blood pressure was 18.8 mg for monotherapy and 13.0 mg for combination therapy (p less than 0.05). Adverse effects were comparable. We concluded that enalapril in combination with hydrochlorothiazide is more effective and safe, and allows for lower dosing of enalapril than the drug as monotherapy in Korean hypertensives.", 
    "284": "In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of captopril after sublingual and peroral administration. Single 25 mg doses of captopril were administered sublingually and perorally on two different occasions in a randomised cross-over fashion to eight healthy volunteers aged 22-35 years. The kinetics of unchanged captopril, plasma renin activity (PRA). BP and heart rate were studied over three hours after both peroral and sublingual administration of captopril. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for unchanged captopril after sublingual administration were: Cmax, 234 ng.ml-1; tmax, 45 min; AUC (0-3 h), 15.1 micrograms.ml-1.min. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for unchanged captopril after peroral administration were; Cmax, 228 ng.ml-1; tmax, 75 min; AUC (0-3 h), 17.0 micrograms.ml-1.min.tmax was significantly shorter when captopril was administered sublingually; all other pharmacokinetic parameters were equivalent. The plasma captopril concentrations achieved post drug administration led to increases in PRA and reductions in BP.tmax for PRA was 86 min for sublingual captopril and 113 min for perorally administered drug. Peak PRA values were, however, not significantly different. BP, as expected, was not reduced dramatically in these healthy volunteer subjects, however, in systolic BP vs time profiles, BP was significantly lower after volunteers received sublingual captopril. Heart rate increased slightly after captopril administration; there were no differences between the two routes of administration. Administration of captopril sublingually, therefore led to a more rapid attainment of plasma captopril concentrations and had a more rapid onset of pharmacological effect when compared with peroral administration.", 
    "285": "This is a review of the effects of E on the symptoms of CHF which affect patients' (pts) quality of life and the signs associated with pts' prognosis. The review is based on clinical studies which were included in the New Drug Application for Vasotec (enalapril maleate, MSD) in the United States. There were 3 open-label (242 pts) and 4 double-blind, placebo (P)-controlled (661 pts) studies of at least 1 month and up to about 2 years duration. One of these, the CONSENSUS Trial evaluated mortality in 253 pts with class IV CHF. Dyspnea and fatigue are considered the most disabling symptoms causing pts' functional impairment and thus reducing the quality of life. Left ventricular gallop, pulmonary rales, cardiomegaly, and ejection fractions are known to adversely effect pts' prognosis. Evaluations of these signs, symptoms, and scores related to these symptoms were included in most, but not all, studies. The pts' NYHA cardiac status was evaluated in all studies. E alleviated the signs and symptoms of CHF and improved various scores in significant number of pts. Pts' quality of life improved as indicated by the number of pts \"feeling better\" after Rx with E (p less than 0.01 vs P) in a multinational study of 256 pts; reductions of cardiomegaly and increases in ejection fraction were significantly greater in E than in P treated pts; and in severe CHF (CONSENSUS Trial) the mortality was significantly reduced (p less than 0.003 vs P).", 
    "286": "Effects of commonly used antihypertensive agents like nifedipine, atenolol, propranolol and captopril on quality of life was studied. Fourty-four patients with essential hypertension entered and 26 completed the full protocol of the study. Each drug was given separately in a random fashion in fixed dosage for 4 weeks with a washout period of 2 weeks in between the drugs. Assessment of quality of life was done under following measures: satisfaction with life and sense of well being, physical state, emotional state, intellectual function, social life and sexual life; each assessed on a prestandardized 5 point scale. All the 4 drugs resulted in significant and similar blood pressure control but the incidence of adverse effects was maximum with nifedipine (40.9%), followed by atenolol (18.4%), propranolol (14.3%) and captopril (3.6%). There was significant improvement in various aspects of quality of life with all the 4 drugs. Captopril and propranolol scored significantly better than atenolol and nifedipine on measures like sense of well being and satisfaction with life, physical state, intellectual function and emotional state. Improvement in sexual life was maximum with captopril, moderate with propranolol and nifedipine and least with atenolol. In conclusion, captopril closely followed by propranolol was the most acceptable drug with fewer adverse effects and improved sexual as well as other aspects of quality of life compared to nifedipine and atenolol.", 
    "287": "In previous studies in the conscious rabbit and in isolated artery preparations, low doses of angiotensin II synergistically amplified the pressor effects of the sympathetic neurotransmitter, norepinephrine (NE). To determine whether these observations could be replicated in humans, 9 normal adult male volunteers (mean age: 34) each were given 3 i.v. doses of NE (25, 50 and 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) during consecutive 10 min infusion periods. On a second study day, the procedure was repeated during infusion of angiotensin II in a subpressor dose (1.25 ng.kg-1.min-1). The angiotensin II didn't alter the BP responses to NE, but it attenuated the heart rate (HR) decreases associated with the NE infusions by 80% (P less than 0.05), 42% (P less than 0.05) and 42% (P less than 0.1). The two study days were then repeated following 2 weeks of oral treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (which, despite significantly decreasing baseline BP, also tended to decrease HR). In the presence of captopril, the pressor responses to the NE challenges were reduced by 50% (P less than 0.05), 33% (P less than 0.05) and 13% (P less than 0.1) compared with the pre-captopril responses. Thus, angiotensin II in subpressor doses appears to enhance NE pressor effects by attenuating the compensatory HR responses, whereas inhibition of endogenous angiotensin II mechanisms weakens the BP-raising actions of NE. These findings in humans are consistent with earlier observations that the renin-angiotensin system can directly amplify sympathetic pressor effects in two separate ways: by modifying baroreceptor sensitivity and by enhancing the actions of norepinephrine on vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "288": "The decrease in renal blood flow (RBF) observed in patients with hypertension can be increased with converting enzyme inhibition (CEI). It is unknown whether the decrease in RBF observed with age can also be increased with CEI. This study compared the short- and long-term effects of captopril monotherapy in young (less than 50 years) and old (greater than 65 years) hypertensive patients. Captopril effectively decreased blood pressure in both groups (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg), with the young patients requiring a lower dose (.7 mg/kg) than the elderly patients (1.2 mg/kg). Creatinine and para-aminohippurate clearances were maintained in both groups, with a decrease in renal vascular resistance being observed in the younger patients. Serum aldosterone levels fell significantly after each dose of captopril at all phases of the study, with no change observed in plasma renin levels. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) level was increased in the elderly patients receiving placebo (48.8 +/- 8 pg/mL) when compared with the young subjects (24 +/- 3.8 pg/mL). Captopril did not alter ANP levels in either group.", 
    "289": "Recent advances in molecular biological techniques provide us with genetic approaches for studying the renin-angiotensin system. Renin and angiotensinogen cDNAs have been cloned in several species, and the sequences are highly conserved between the species. The 5'-flanking region of the human renin gene indicated putative regulatory sequences of glucocorticoid, estrogen, progesterone, and cAMP. The 5'-flanking region of the human angiotensinogen gene also had putative regulatory sequences of glucocorticoid, estrogen, acute phase protein, and cAMP. These structures may be related to the tissue specific expression of the renin and angiotensinogen genes. In this review, expression of rat renin and angiotensinogen genes in various tissues in the following conditions are described: a) different sodium intake in the liver, kidney, and brain; b) angiotensin II and converting enzyme inhibition in the liver, kidney and brain; c) renovascular hypertension in the kidney and liver; d) aging in the liver and kidney; e) adrenal steroids in the liver, kidney and brain; f) gonadotropin and testosterone in the testes, liver and kidney; g) triiodothyronine in the liver, kidney and brain; h) nephrectomy in the liver and brain; i) high potassium, angiotensin II, sodium intake and nephrectomy in the adrenal gland; j) transgenic animal. Our results suggest that the expression of the renin and angiotensinogen genes are regulated in a tissue-specific manner.", 
    "290": "A prospective study was carried out to investigate the effects of the ACE inhibitor captopril on glucose tolerance in 14 elderly patients, aged 76 to 89 years, who had co-incident cardiac failure and stable Type II diabetes mellitus. Patients were maintained on their diet and diabetic therapy and were given 12.5 mg captopril twice daily. Clinical findings, including signs of cardiac failure, body weight and blood pressure, biochemical profile and chest X-ray appearance were documented at each visit. Blood glucose tolerance testing was carried out immediately before starting captopril and again 28 days later. A reduction in symptoms of heart failure occurred in all patients and 5 of them reduced their New York Heart Association grade of heart failure. Significant improvement in glucose tolerance occurred in all patients. Four were able to reduce hypoglycaemic therapy and 1 was able to stop his hypoglycaemic agents. This potentially valuable additional benefit of captopril in improving glucose tolerance has not yet been shown to occur with other ACE inhibitors.", 
    "291": "More than 10 years of clinical experience using angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have shown that this class of drug does not have any adverse metabolic effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Rather, a number of studies on patients with essential hypertension or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have indicated minor improvements in glucose homeostasis and correction of dyslipidaemia. Some recent studies using the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique have indicated that the beneficial effect of captopril, the most extensively studied drug, is exerted on insulin sensitivity, a site with the potential to influence glucose and lipid metabolism. There is no uniform explanation for this action of captopril, but increased blood flow in skeletal muscle, accumulation of bradykinin or more efficient insulin release may be suggested as potential modes of action. It remains to be established whether this effect of captopril can be extrapolated to other ACE inhibitors, and the extent to which effects on insulin sensitivity will influence the long-term consequences for future risk of diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease in patients with essential hypertension.", 
    "292": "A simple and sensitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for determination of the active metabolite (RS-5139) of a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (CS-622) was developed. The N-succinimmidyl ester of RS-5139 was coupled with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and its conjugate was used as an immunogen. Horse radish peroxidase (HRP; EC 1, 11, 1, 7) was used as a labeled enzyme and 3, 3', 5, 5'-tetramethylbenzidine was used as a substrate. The antiserum was used at a final dilution of 1:10000 and sensitivity was 10 pg in plasma and 20pg in urine. CS-622 exhibited cross-reactivity (22.3%), but other ACE inhibitors didn't exhibit cross-reactivity. The plasma levels determined by EIA and GC/MS was good agreement (y = 6.58e-2 + 1.07x, R - 2 = 0.985, n = 52).",

Captopril 25 mg/kg b.w. and gentamicin 100 mg/kg b.w. were injected subcutaneously in a single daily dose. Three groups of Wistar male rats were studied: 1) treated with gentamicin 3 and 7 days, 2) treated with gentamicin and captopril, 3) treated with captopril. The mean serum creatinine and urea levels and proteinuria in the second group were significantly higher than in the first one. Light and electron microscopy examinations demonstrated increased renal cortex damage in the second group. There were not differences between mean urea and creatinine levels in the third examined group and normal rats. Mechanism of gentamicin nephrotoxicity enhancement in the second group is unknown.",

The biochemical mechanisms underlying VSMC proliferation and the precise chemical stimuli for the initiation and maintenance of proliferation are poorly understood. In this review, the biochemical basis for a phenotypic transition and its requirement for VSMC proliferation are discussed along with potential mechanisms for the induction of VSMC proliferation by conventional mitogens and vasoconstrictor agonists. Finally the prospect for therapeutic pharmacological intervention is reviewed.", 
    "297": "Regular drug treatment in mild hypertension (diastolic blood pressure 90-104 mm Hg) reduces death from stroke, and other non-coronary vascular events. The optimum strategy remains sequential monotherapy with the lowest effective dose, with drug combinations as an option. A beta-adrenoceptor blocker or low-dose thiazide is good value treatment for many patients. beta-Blockers are good for young (under 50 years), anxious non-smoking men, men after myocardial infarction, and renal failure patients. Older persons over about 65 years, women, smokers, stroke victims, and liver disease patients should generally take a thiazide or calcium ion-channel blocker. Pregnant women and untreated gouty patients should avoid diuretics. Calcium blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferable in severe or insulin-dependent diabetes and renal failure, and angiotensin manipulators or thiazides in heart failure or peripheral vessel disease. Hyperlipidaemia should not generally exclude thiazides or beta-blockers. Some hypertensive stroke patients without encephalopathy may not need antihypertensive drug treatment for the first 24-48 hours. Drug treatment should be tailored to individuals according to their general condition, physiological age, and any concurrent disease or medication. Unwanted drug reactions should not deter patients from fulfilling social and economic goals. The desired treatment end-point is a diastolic pressure of 85-89 mm Hg, but a compromise is usual in poorly motivated young men, and the elderly.", 
    "298": "Although experiments in the rat suggest that glomerular hemodynamic alterations following a reduction of renal mass may be implicated in the progression of chronic renal failure, we argue that the deleterious effects of similar adaptations in human renal disease are unproven. In the otherwise normal solitary kidney the supranormal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remains stable over the longterm, and in early diabetic nephropathy which is also accompanied by hyperfiltration, renal deterioration cannot be dissociated from a rise in systemic blood pressure. In patients with miscellaneous renal diseases and a depressed basal GFR there is indirect evidence that hyperfiltration might occur in some of the remnant glomeruli. However, at present there is little conclusive evidence to indicate that therapies which might normalize glomerular hemodynamics, e.g., dietary protein restriction, have any effect on progression of renal disease, or that angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors, which lower glomerular capillary pressure, have any advantage over other antihypertensive agents which are equally efficacious in lowering systemic blood pressure.", 
    "299": "A captopril challenge test (CCT) for renovascular disease in adults was described recently. We used it in 20 consecutive, untreated hypertensive children and adolescents. All had a normal urinalysis and glomerular filtration rate and non-diagnostic renal sonograms or intravenous urograms. Plasma renin activity (PRA) was measured before and 1 h after administration of captopril (0.76 +/- 0.17 mg/kg). The CCT was positive in 10 patients. Renal arteriograms were performed in 7 patients with a positive CCT and in 2 with a negative CCT. Renovascular disease was found in 4 patients, 1 of whom had a negative CCT. The PRA response to captopril was the same in patients with true- and the false-positive tests. The predictive value of the positive test was 43%. In conclusion, we did not find the CCT, as described for adults, to be of value in children and adolescents.", 
    "300": "This was a randomized double-blind, multiclinic, parallel, three treatments group study to compare the safety and efficacy of a fixed-ratio combination of enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide (E/HCTZ: 20/12.5-40/25 N = 46) to enalapril (E = 20-40 mg, N = 49) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ: 12.5-25 mg, N = 51) once daily, in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe essential hypertension (100 less than or equal to supine diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 120 mmHg). A significant decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure was shown in the 3 subgroups of patients. The decrease of blood pressure was significantly greater in the E/HCTZ subgroup. After 8 weeks of treatment, the E/HCTZ group had the greatest proportion of normotensive patients (65.9 p. cent, DBP less than or equal to 90 mmHg) and of responders (81.8 p. cent, diastolic blood pressure decrease greater than 10 mmHg). The treatment groups did not differ significantly with respect to clinical adverse events. The study results document the well-known hyperuricemic effect of diuretics and also indicate that the combination of enalapril and HCTZ ameliorates this effects. In this study plasma potassium was slightly but not significantly decreased by HCTZ. The combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide did not alter this parameter. The results support the conclusion that in the treatment of moderate to severe hypertension, the combination enalapril/HCTZ 20/12.5 to 40/25 mg, taken once daily, is more effective than either its components used alone. This combination is well tolerated, probably due to an adequate enalapril/HCTZ dosage ratio.", 
    "301": "The long-term prognosis in severe congestive heart failure is very poor. Therapeutic regimens, in order to improve prognosis, should directly or indirectly influence the compensatory systems that are activated, ACE-inhibitor therapy has emerged as an important regimen in this context. In the CONSENSUS-trial (3), we could demonstrate that the addition of enalapril to conventional therapy in severe CHF significantly improved survival. The experience from this study forms the background for the recommendations in this work. 253 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA) Classification functional class IV) were randomized at 35 Scandinavian centers to placebo (n = 126) or enalapril (n = 127), in addition to their conventional therapy. The treatment dose of enalapril varied between 2.5 and 40 mg daily (man 18.3 mg). Blood samples for measurement of serum electrolytes and serum creatinine were taken repeatedly during follow-up. There seems to be about a 10% increase in creatinine within 2 weeks of initiating enalapril therapy. This increase seems to be independent of baseline creatinine level. Adverse experience regarding serum creatinine was reported in 22 placebo-treated patients and in 51 patients in the enalapril group. This reporting was based upon the investigators' feelings of significant importance of the observation and not on symptomatology. This was the main reason for permanent withdrawal in 2 and 7 patients, respectively. During initiation of enalapril therapy the blood pressure response is important after the very first dose, but for renal function the response may not appear until several days later. However, in most patients there are no problems with starting enalapril.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In addition to digitalis and diuretics, 20 patients were treated with low-dose enalapril (5 mg/d; group E), while the previous therapy including conventional vasodilators was continued in the other 20 patients (group K). After 1 year in group E, the functional degree of heart failure decreased significantly compared to group K (p less than 0.02): 65% of group E patients improved by at least one NYHA functional class vs only 5% in group K. Parallel to the clinical changes in group E, cardiac size decreased significantly compared to group K, when measured as either a decrease in the cardiac thoracic ratio of the chest x-ray from 0.55 +/- 0.07 to 0.52 +/- 0.11 (p less than 0.02) or in the echocardiographically determined left ventricular end-diastolic diameter from 72 +/- 9 to 65 +/- 7 mm (p less than 0.01). Severe side effects or complications occurred in 15% of the patients in group E and in 10% of group K, showing no significant difference between the two groups. During the 1-year observation period, two patients died in group E, and nine patients died in group K, resulting in a significantly (p less than 0.025) different mortality rate of 10% in group E compared to 45% in group K.

Blood pressure was measured by the oscillometric method using the blood pressure monitor 90202 from SpaceLabs, Inc.. All patients received an additional therapy either with captopril (group A, n = 17) or enalapril (group B, n = 16) in random order. Serum-electrolytes, serum- and urine-creatinine, and plasma-renin- activity were measured before and during therapy with both ACE-inhibitors. 24-h blood pressure measurements were taken before and on the first and fifth days of the treatment with ACE-inhibitors. Neither group was different with respect to the degree of heart failure, the concomitant medication, and the 24-h profiles of blood pressure and heart rate. The mean initial dose of captopril was 9.2 +/- 1.2 mg which was titrated to a mean daily dose of 40.7 +/- 3.3 mg given three-times daily. Each patient of group B received an initial dose of 2.5 mg enalapril and a mean maintenance dose of 8.4 +/- 0.9 mg once daily. The first dose effect on blood pressure was similar with captopril and enalapril with a maximal decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 8/8 mmHg (after 1 h) in group A and of 9/7 mmHg (after 4 h) in group B. The 24-h blood pressure values on day 5 were consistently below the pretreatment values (p less than 0.005) but heart rate was not significantly affected by either ACE-inhibitor.

    "304": "Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 prazosin. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III. Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension (5.2%) than the patients who received prazosin (12.9%). All patients recovered. It was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is, therefore, unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients.", 
    "305": "While being similar to each other with respect to their pharmacodynamic effects, the various ACE inhibitors may differ considerably concerning their pharmacokinetic properties. Pharmacokinetic features that may influence the clinical choice for or against a particular ACE inhibitor include its oral bioavailability, plasma protein binding, tissue distribution, metabolization, and excretion. It should be kept in mind, however, that there may be considerable discrepancies between pharmacokinetic parameters in the plasma and the clinical effects (e.g., on blood pressure) of the same substance. These differences may be due to the fact that ACE inhibitors, especially upon chronic administration, predominantly act on local (paracrine/intracrine) renin-angiotensin-systems (RAS) rather than on the plasma RAS (endocrine RAS).", 
    "306": "The role of ACE-inhibition for the treatment of congestive heart failure has been established over the last decade. In patients with moderate and severe congestive heart failure long-term beneficial effects on symptoms may be achieved in 60-70%. Mortality is significantly improved in patients with congestive heart failure functional class NYHA IV. Therefore, ACE-inhibitors are superior to other vasodilators. Hypotension represents an important side effect of ACE-inhibitors. It is predominantly due to either inhibition of systemic and/or local angiotensin II formation or to reduce degradation of bradykinin. If the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is stimulated, as in severe congestive heart failure and/or by diuretic pretreatment, the risk for the occurrence of hypotension is therefore increased. With respect to these risk factors, small doses of ACE-inhibitors should be administered initially, e.g. captopril 6.25 mg or enalapril, 2.5 mg. Recently, two large trials demonstrated the safety of enalapril, a long-acting ACE-inhibitor, regarding the occurrence of hypotension in patients with congestive heart failure. The overall incidence of hypotension is about 2-4% in mild to moderate and about 5-8% in severe heart failure. Reduction of the dosage of the ACE-inhibitor or the diuretic drug usually results in normalization of blood pressure, allowing continuation of therapy with ACE-inhibitors.",

    "308": "Acute reversible renal failure is a widely recognized potential complication of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) administration in renovascular hypertension, particularly in bilateral artery stenosis or stenosis involving a solitary kidney. We report herein 2 cases of a rare but severe complication, i.e., acute renal artery thrombosis. Whereas marked hypotension does not seem to be necessary to trigger acute renal failure following ACE inhibition, by contrast, the fall in blood pressure could play an important role in our patients. Since single-dose ACEI has been advocated in order to improve the predictive value of renal scintigraphy or plasma renin activity measurements in the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension, the potential risk of this approach should be stressed.", 
    "309": "The dipsogenic responsiveness to acute administration of the peptide, bradykinin, was studied in 4 groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats. All groups received captopril (35 mg/kg, IP) 15 minutes prior to the study. The first group then received saline (1 ml/kg, IP) while the remaining three groups received bradykinin at 50, 100 and 200 micrograms/kg, SC, respectively. The rats were placed alone into metabolic cages without food and given a preweighed bottle of tap water. Water intakes and urine outputs were then measured at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 hours thereafter. Bradykinin induced a dose-related increase in water intake but had no significant effect on urine output. To assess whether bradykinin might induce drinking by way of angiotensin II (AII) receptors, the AII receptor antagonist. Sar1, Ile8-AII (Sar, 300 and 600 micrograms/kg, SC) was administered to both bradykinin- (200 micrograms/kg, SC) and bradykinin plus captopril-treated (35 mg/kg, IP) groups of rats in a two-way ANOVA statistical design. Bradykinin again stimulated drinking in captopril-treated rats, but the drinking was not blocked significantly by administration of Sar. The results of this study indicate that blockade of the angiotensin I converting enzyme increases the half-life of bradykinin and unmasks its dipsogenic properties. The results suggest further that bradykinin does not appear to induce drinking via interaction with receptors for AII.", 
    "310": "The intracerebroventricular injection of eledoisin (ELE), or of other tachykinins with potent agonist activity at neurokinin B (NK-3) receptors, increases plasma vasopressin in the rat. The effect is antagonized by saralasin pretreatment, thus suggesting that it is mediated by angiotensin receptor activation. Since the magnocellular part of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) is very rich in NK-3 receptors, the present study was aimed at investigating the role of this nucleus in the effect of ELE on plasma vasopressin. Direct injection of ELE into the PVN increased plasma vasopressin levels more potently than the injection of the same doses into the lateral ventricle. Lesioning of the magnocellular part of the PVN completely abolished the increase in plasma vasopressin induced by the injection of ELE 100 ng/rat into the lateral ventricle. Pretreatment into the PVN either with saralasin or with captopril resulted in a marked suppression of the effect of ELE on plasma vasopressin. These findings indicate the PVN as a site of action for the central effect of tachykinins on plasma vasopressin and suggest that the angiotensin mediation of the effect might take place in the same nucleus.", 
    "311": "1. Fifty patients with symptoms due to chronic heart failure despite diuretic therapy were randomised to receive additional treatment with either hydralazine or captopril. The dose was titrated; 24 received hydralazine and 26 captopril up to a maximum daily dosage of 225 mg and 75 mg respectively. Forty-three patients had coronary heart disease and seven dilated cardiomyopathy. 2. Dyspnoea and tiredness were assessed using a visual analogue scale (0-100) before and during 12 weeks' treatment. Captopril produced a significantly greater reduction in breathlessness (F = 31.6, P less than 0.001) and tiredness (F = 65.8, P less than 0.001) compared with hydralazine. 3. There was an increase in treadmill exercise time during treatment with both hydralazine (from 5.5 (3.47-7.53) min to 6.9 (4.87-8.93) min), and captopril (from 5.0 (3.05-6.95) min to 7.8 (5.85-9.75) min), but the degree of improvement was significantly greater in the patients treated with captopril (F = 7.4, P less than 0.001). 4. There was no significant change in right ventricular ejection fraction (from 27.9 (19.3-36.5)% to 28.7 (20.1-37.3)%) or left ventricular ejection fraction (from 22.2 (14.2-30.2)% to 23.9 (15.9-31.9)%) during treatment with hydralazine. However, both right and left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly during treatment with captopril (from 27.1 (18.9-35.3)% to 32.0 (23.8-40.2)%, P less than 0.05; and from 25.0 (17.2-32.8)% to 29.6 (21.8-37.4)%, P less than 0.05 respectively). 5.

    "312": "Bradykinin (BK) in an asanguinous salt solution was perfused through intact rat lung. BK concentration varied from 0.0015 to 89 microM. Below 17 microM, the amount degraded was greater than or equal to 90% of the dose. The BK fragment distributions expressed as a percentage of the BK dose degraded were constant. The BK fragments formed and percentage yields were Pro-Pro (2-3) 49%, Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe (1-5) 32%, Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro (2-7) 6%, Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro (1-7) 6%, Arg-Pro-Pro (1-3) 3% and residual BK 4%. Above 17 microM, the amount of BK degraded was not proportional to the dose. Captopril and enalaprilat inhibited BK degradation, and their maximum inhibitions were about 50% and 30%, respectively. The percentage yield of the 1-5 fragment was greatly reduced by both inhibitors, but the percentage yields of the 2-3 and 1-8 fragments were moderately increased. It was concluded that (1) the intact rat lung itself has a very large capacity to degrade BK in the range of 2 mumoles/min/kg body weight; (2) two major and several minor enzyme pathways exist to degrade BK; (3) the relative contributions of these pathways to overall BK degradation remain essentially constant over a bradykinin concentration range from 0.0015 to 17 microM; (4) ACE/kininase-II catalyzed hydrolysis is one of the major pathways but is not the single major route for BK degradation; and (5) the other major BK degradation pathway involves enzymes cleaving the Arg1-Pro2 and Pro3-Gly4 bonds of BK.", 
    "313": "The term quality of life implies more than adverse effects that make treatment intolerable. It is not new but has only relatively recently become a parameter to be measured in patients treated for cardiovascular disease. Lessons can be learned from other conditions in which the Karnovsky Index and the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale have been used. Several investigators have used questionnaires to assess quality of life during antihypertensive therapy. However, assessment of the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on quality of life has only been done recently. The largest and best known study, of 625 white men with mild hypertension, reported that patients given captopril showed a significant improvement after 6 months in general well-being, work performance, and those skills associated with cognitive function. No such improvement was found with methyldopa and there was significant worsening in measures associated with depression, sexual dysfunction, and life satisfaction. The propranolol group, while showing improvement in cognitive functioning and social participation, manifested worsening of sexual function and physical symptoms. Diuretic therapy had a greater negative impact on the quality of life of hypertensive patients than captopril, propranolol, or methyldopa alone. Whether these results will be seen in other patient populations, and the pharmacological basis for these results, remains to be determined. As newer agents become available (eg, beta-blockers with ancillary properties, calcium channel blockers with allegedly more selective actions on various vascular beds), comparative studies between these agents and ACE inhibitors old and new are awaited with interest.", 
    "314": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have additive effects with most other antihypertensive agents, but the mechanisms of these interactions vary. With diuretics the interaction with ACE inhibitors can be explained by their contrasting effects on the renin-angiotensin system, while with calcium antagonists it may be attributed to independent mechanisms of action. With beta-blockers there is a variable additive effect, which has been proposed to be due to more complete blockade of the renin-angiotensin system than can be obtained with either type of agent alone.", 
    "315": "Converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) are useful in the treatment of hypertension. However, acute renal deterioration may occur in some conditions in association with the crucial role of angiotensin in the regulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), such as volume depletion, severe stenosis of both renal arteries, and stenosis of a single functioning kidney. CEI-induced acute renal failure can develop in the absence of a fall in systemic pressure, is facilitated by prior sodium depletion, and is reversible upon discontinuation of treatment. In a personal study conducted in 28 patients with CEI-induced renal dysfunction (reversible after discontinuation of CEI), the incidence of stenosis of large renal vessels was 61%, whereas 39% of these subjects had no significant renal artery abnormalities. Although the occurrence of such a complication is not a convincingly accurate predictor of the existence of renovascular hypertension, angiographic detection of renal artery stenosis (bilateral or on a single-functioning kidney) may be justified in some of these patients.", 
    "316": "Previously we reported that immunoreactive angiotensin II (Ang II) release from isolated perfused human umbilical veins was inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril. To further investigate the mechanism by which Ang II is generated in the blood vessels of humans, we examined the effects of various inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (captopril, delapril, N-acetyl-pepstatin, and human renin inhibitor KRI-1314) on Ang II release from perfused human umbilical cord veins in vitro. Isolated human umbilical veins were perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution, and immunoreactive Ang II released into the perfusate was measured directly by using a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge connected to the perfusion system. Both captopril and delapril diacid (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-6) mol/L), an active metabolite of delapril hydrochloride, suppressed the Ang II release in a dose-dependent fashion; the maximal percent suppression of Ang II release evoked by these inhibitors (5 x 10(-6) mol/L) was 56% and 64%, respectively, for captopril and delapril. Both N-acetyl-pepstatin (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L) and KRI-1314 (10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) suppressed Ang II release in a dose-related manner. At a 10(-6) mol/L concentration, KRI-1314 produced a 74% reduction in the basal rate of Ang II release, and a reduction threefold greater than the maximal reduction in basal Ang II release produced by N-acetyl-pepstatin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "317": "Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the local control of arterial tone. To further gain insight into the significance of vascular RAS in hypertension, we investigated the relationship between the antihypertensive action of delapril, a newly developed converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), and its effects on vascular angiotensin II (Ang II) release in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Male SHRs were given delapril or its active metabolite (5-hydroxydelapril diacid; 5-hydroxy-DPD) orally (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Isolated hind legs of these rats were perfused with angiotensinogen-free Krebs-Ringer solution, and Ang II released into the perfusate was directly determined by extraction with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges connected to the perfusion system. Both delapril and 5-hydroxy-DPD produced a sustained antihypertensive action. The spontaneous release of Ang II from isolated perfused hind legs of control SHRs was about 50 to 110 pg during the first 30 min of perfusion, and it remained stable up to 3 h. Another active metabolite, delapril diacid (DPD), when added to the perfusion medium (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-5) mol/L), suppressed the Ang II release in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal percent inhibition of Ang II released evoked by DPD (5 x 10(-6) mol/L) was approximately 51%. Oral pretreatment of either delapril or 5-hydroxy-DPD for 2 weeks suppressed the Ang II release by 61% and 73% for delapril and 5-hydroxy-DPD, respectively. These results suggest the presence of a functional RAS in vascular tissues, and that delapril exerts its antihypertensive effect through inhibition of vascular Ang II release in SHRs.", 
    "318": "The effects of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the release of angiotensin II (Ang II) from isolated mesenteric arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were examined. Delapril, enalapril, and captopril suppressed Ang II release in a dose-dependent manner. After oral treatment with delapril (10 mg/kg/day), enalapril (10 mg/kg/day), and captopril (50 mg/kg/day) for 1 week, the blood pressure of SHRs was significantly reduced in the three groups and 54%, 46%, and 36% decreases in basal Ang II release were observed, respectively, compared with control. However, low-dose captopril (10 mg/kg/day) had no effect on blood pressure or basal Ang II release. These results provide clear evidence that ACE inhibitors suppress vascular renin-angiotensin activity of SHRs, and the possible contribution of the tissue renin-angiotensin system to spontaneous hypertension is suggested.", 
    "319": "The effects of delapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, on renal function and the renin-angiotensin and kallikrein-prostaglandin systems were investigated in 10 hypertensive patients who were treated for between 4 months and 1 year. There was a significant (P less than .05) increase in renal blood flow (RBF) without affecting glomerular filtration rate. Filtration fraction increased, while renal vascular resistance decreased. There were also significant (P less than .05) increases in urinary kallikrein and prostaglandin excretion, while thromboxane excretion decreased. There was no change in urinary aldosterone excretion. These results suggest that renal hemodynamic changes seen during long-term therapy with delapril are caused, in part, by activation of the kallikrein-prostaglandin system, as well as suppression of the renin-angiotensin system.", 
    "320": "To compare the effects of three different angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on the cough reflex, capsaicin and citric acid challenge tests were done in normal subjects and hypertensive patients before and after administration of delapril, captopril, or enalapril. Two groups of 7 normal subjects (single dose study: 15 mg delapril v 18.75 mg captopril or 2.5 mg enalapril) and a group of 6 mildly hypertensive patients (1 week study: cross-over administration of 30 mg/day delapril, 37.5 mg/day captopril, or 5 mg/day enalapril) were studied. Another group of 6 patients with essential hypertension was treated with three ACE inhibitors for 4 weeks in a randomized order, with a 2 week washout period between active therapies. Aerosols of 1 mumol/L and 3 mumol/L capsaicin and 0.68% citric acid in 0.9% NaCl were generated by an ultrasonic nebulizer, and the frequency of cough was counted during inhalation. Delapril treatment resulted in substantially fewer patients with a significant increase (greater than or equal to 4 coughs during treatment than during the control period) in the frequency of cough than did captopril treatment. In the 1 and 4 week studies, enalapril and captopril had substantially more occurrences of significantly increased capsaicin-induced cough than did delapril. These results indicate that delapril has the least cough stimulatory effect among these ACE inhibitors, which may be clinically beneficial.", 
    "321": "Delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor discovered in the laboratory of Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., is the result of drug design based on the structure-activity relationships of ACE inhibitors. Delapril is an antihypertensive agent with a relatively long duration of action and no SH moiety in its structure. Following administration, it is converted into two active metabolites. Delapril effectively lowered blood pressure in 73% of 1,008 patients with hypertension during clinical trials in Japan. Efficacy rates were 73% for essential hypertension, 85% for renal hypertension, and 80% for renovascular hypertension. Excellent hypotensive response was observed in all age groups, from young to elderly patients. Side effects during administration of delapril, based on subjective evidence, were reported in 80 out of the 1,008 cases (7.9%). The main symptoms included orthostatic dizziness (1.7%), dizziness (1.3%), and nausea (1.1%). Dry cough, which has attracted attention in recent years as a side effect of ACE inhibitors, was reported at a low incidence of 1.1%. In a double-blind, controlled study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in which captopril served as a positive control, delapril showed superior hypotensive effect and greater safety. Data derived from the Japan Study Group on Delapril indicate that this ACE inhibitor has excellent hypotensive effects and a high level of safety. It is suitable as a first-line drug in both monotherapy and combined therapy.", 
    "322": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors delapril and enalapril were compared in a double-blind, randomized, parallel study. The population included 142 patients with essential hypertension who were treated with delapril and 140 treated with enalapril. At the end of a 2 week initial placebo period, the diastolic blood pressure of these patients ranged from 95 to 115 mm Hg in the sitting position. After this placebo period, randomization took place. Patients in the delapril group received 15 mg of the drug twice daily. Treatment with enalapril was started with a daily dose of 10 mg. If the diastolic blood pressure did not fall to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or at least by 15 mm Hg after 2 weeks of treatment, the doses of the ACE inhibitors were doubled. After another 2 weeks, 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily was added if the target level of diastolic blood pressure was not reached. Both drugs caused a similar decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of both ACE inhibitors was increased by the addition of the diuretic. The frequency and severity of side effects were similar in the two groups of patients. It is concluded from this study that delapril and enalapril do not differ in antihypertensive efficacy nor in safety.", 
    "323": "In order to investigate the effect of delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on the diurnal variation of arterial pressure in patients with essential hypertension, this study examined 24 h arterial pressure using an indirect or a direct monitoring system. When the effect of twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg was examined using the indirect monitoring system in 12 outpatients, delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressures significantly only at limited points during the day. However, each of the averaged 24 h daytime and nighttime arterial pressures showed significant reductions. The 24 h intraarterial pressure monitoring demonstrated that delapril decreased systolic and diastolic arterial pressure at most of the measurement points. The arterial pressure reductions during daytime and nighttime were not significantly different, that is, there was no excessive reduction in nighttime arterial pressure. Heart rate and its variability were virtually unaffected by the delapril treatment in either monitoring study. No adverse reactions were observed in the indirect or direct monitoring studies. Thus, it is concluded that twice-a-day administration of delapril at daily doses of 30 to 90 mg brings about a safe and stable antihypertensive effect, without affecting the diurnal variation of arterial pressure.", 
    "324": "Delapril, a nonsulfhydryl angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which has an indanylglycine moiety differing from the proline moiety of captopril or enalapril, is an esterified prodrug that is converted in vivo to its active metabolites. Delapril effectively inhibits rabbit lung ACE activity and lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Delapril has several characteristics that differ from captopril and enalapril, including high lipophilicity and weak bradykinin potentiating action. Delapril is a more potent inhibitor of vascular wall ACE activity than enalapril or captopril. It also shows a weaker potentiating action on the citric acid-induced cough in the guinea pig model compared with captopril and enalapril. In 12 out of 150 patients with essential hypertension who complained of cough during treatment with enalapril, changing to delapril resulted in resolution of the cough in 6 out of 12 of these patients: the percentage of patients in the total population with cough decreased from 8% to 4%.", 
    "325": "Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, renin, and the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor lower the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) used as a model of essential hypertension. Since their plasma renin levels were normal or subnormal, renin in the vascular tissue was considered to play a key role in the maintenance of the hypertension. To clarify the source and localization of renin in SHR, antirenin antibodies, the converting enzyme inhibitors delapril, enalapril, and the Ang II receptor antagonist DuP 753 were administered to intact and bilaterally nephrectomized SHR and their normotensive controls. The efficient hypotensive action of the renin antibody indicated that renin of renal origin is a dominant factor. Gradual but complete disappearance of antihypertensive action of these inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system upon bilateral nephrectomy indicated the importance of membrane-associated renin of the renal origin and angiotensin converting enzyme in the maintenance of the spontaneous hypertension.", 
    "326": "Clinical disorders causing hyperkalemia require a basic understanding of normal K homeostasis, which consists of external and internal K balances. The kidney is predominant in maintaining the external balance of K, and a number of mechanisms exist to provide a renal adaptation to defend against K excess. Likewise, several factors are known to modulate internal K balance--i.e., its distribution within the body. Some of these factors may provide defense against hyperkalemia before the kidneys have time to adapt. Potassium retention by the kidney causes hyperkalemia when renal failure is advanced, or earlier in the face of impaired tubular function in a variety of disorders. Hyperkalemia out of proportion to loss of renal function also occurs in the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. Drug-induced hyperkalemia is increasingly common and usually is caused by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, cyclosporine, or K-sparing diuretics. Clinical disorders of internal K imbalance include diabetes mellitus, systemic acidosis, and use of beta-blockers. Hyperkalemia is usually asymptomatic, but the danger of cardiac arrest or arrhythmia in severe hyperkalemia forces prompt clinical attention. Available treatment choices include agents that antagonize the effect of K on membrane potentials, redistribute it internally into cells, and remove it altogether from the body. The diagnostic work-up can then proceed, first by distinguishing renal and extrarenal causes, then by examining the roles of specific factors outlined in the section on normal K homeostasis.", 
    "327": "Progressive myocardial fibrosis, including the accumulation of collagen within the adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries, is seen in the hypertrophied rat myocardium secondary to renovascular hypertension (RHT) and has been held responsible for alterations in myocardial diastolic stiffness. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that this presumptive angiotensin-aldosterone mediated fibrosis and its functional consequences could be favorably altered by an antihypertensive oral dose (50 mg/kg/day) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Three groups were studied: control; untreated RHT for 8 weeks; treated RHT, with captopril started 48 h before banding and continued for 8 weeks. Interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area (morphometry), the fibrillar nature of collagen (picrosirius polarization), and the end diastolic stress-strain relation of the intact left ventricle were examined in each group. In comparison to untreated animals with RHT, we found that captopril, begun prior to banding, attenuated interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and prevented hypertrophy and the rise in diastolic stiffness 8 weeks later. Thus, an adverse accumulation of collagen in the interstitium and around intramyocardial coronary arteries, and its functional consequences in the rat with RHT, can be prevented by captopril. Other ACE inhibitors may have similar salutary effects, but remain to be evaluated. The pathogenetic origin of myocardial fibrosis in RHT requires further investigation, but appears to be related to the angiotensin-aldosterone system.", 
    "328": "Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) shifts the limits of cerebral blood flow autoregulation toward lower blood pressure values. This effect seems to be mediated by blocking the formation of angiotensin II on the luminal side of the larger cerebral resistance vessels. Baseline cerebral blood flow (the flow within the autoregulatory limits) is not changed by acute or chronic ACE inhibition. An interaction between the vascular reninangiotensin and the sympathetic nervous system is present. Activation of the latter inhibits the downwards shift of the upper limit of autoregulation following ACE inhibition.", 
    "329": "This paper reviews previous work done by my laboratory to investigate the effect of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on blood pressure and small artery structure in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). First, the data confirm that ACE inhibitors have a persistent effect on blood pressure in SHRs when treatment is withdrawn. The effect of the ACE inhibitors was dose-dependent, but the persistent effect was not dose-dependent. This suggests that the persistent effect of ACE inhibitors on blood pressure in SHRs is not mediated through vascular structure. Secondly, the data demonstrate that, although ACE inhibitors have dose-dependent effects on both blood pressure and vascular structure, in experiments where different drugs were used, the effect of ACE inhibitors on vascular structure seems to be explained primarily through their effect on blood pressure, rather than any specific drugs effect.", 
    "330": "Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, renin and angiotensin II receptor lower the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) used as a model of essential hypertension. Since their plasma renin levels were normal or subnormal, renin in the vascular tissue was considered to play a key role in the maintenance of the hypertension. To clarify the source and localization of vascular renin in SHRs, the effects on blood pressure of antirenin antibodies, the converting enzyme inhibitors delapril and enalapril, and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 were examined in intact and bilaterally nephrectomized SHRs and their normotensive controls. The efficient hypotensive action of the renin antibody indicated that renin of the renal origin is a dominant factor. The gradual but complete disappearance of the antihypertensive action of these inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system upon bilateral nephrectomy indicated the importance of membrane-associated renin of the renal origin and angiotensin-converting enzyme in the maintenance of the spontaneous hypertension.", 
    "331": "To test the hypothesis that angiotensin (Ang) I and II are produced by blood vessels, we investigated the formation of both Ang I and Ang II in isolated, perfused rat hindquarters. To characterize the nature of this production further, we modulated plasma renin by total or subtotal nephrectomy and tested the effects of exogenous renin and renin substrate on vascular Ang formation. Assays of the perfusate by high-performance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay demonstrated the spontaneous release of Ang I and Ang II from the hindlimb vasculature. Conversion of Ang I to Ang II in hindquarter vasculature was approximately 75% and was totally suppressed by captopril. The spontaneous formation of Ang peptides was abolished by bilateral nephrectomy but was not affected by subtotal 5/6 nephrectomy. The addition of purified rat angiotensinogen to the preparation increased Ang II levels. The infusion of renin into the hindlimb vasculature led to substantial increases in local Ang formation and also raised the perfusion pressure. Both effects were sensitive to captopril and to the renin inhibitor H-142. The data indicate that Ang I and Ang II are produced locally within blood vessels. However, the origin of vascular renin remains controversial. Our results suggest that part of the enzyme is taken up from plasma.", 
    "332": "The role of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in the treatment of progressive renal disease is described. Researchers have evaluated the use of ACEIs in patients with two types of progressive kidney disease: diabetic nephropathy and renal insufficiency associated with connective-tissue disease. When introduced early in the course of diabetic nephropathy, ACEIs appear to produce greater reductions in urinary protein concentrations than do other antihypertensive agents, even when systemic blood pressure does not decrease. They also slow the rate of decline of renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Results are less impressive when ACEIs are initiated at a later stage of disease. Captopril has been shown to be associated with a decline in serum creatinine level in patients with systemic scleroderma, and with reductions in blood pressure and increases in the glomerular filtration rate in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Because these patients were receiving other agents that might have influenced study outcome, specific conclusions about the efficacy of ACEIs in connective-tissue disease cannot yet be drawn. They may, however, be recommended as adjunctive agents in treatment of this condition. The relative safety of the ACEIs, combined with their ability to arrest or slow the progression of renal failure, makes them primary options in the management of selected renal diseases.", 
    "333": "The epidemiology, pathology, diagnosis, and clinical manifestations of systemic scleroderma (SSc) are described, and therapeutic options are discussed. SSc is a rare condition of unknown etiology that occurs in a subset of scleroderma patients. It is distinguished by involvement of the small arteries, microvessels, and diffuse connective tissue. The degree of internal organ involvement is the main determinant of morbidity and mortality. Management of SSc may entail supportive, palliative, remittive, and immunosuppressive therapies. Supportive therapy involves maintaining the affected extremities at warm temperatures and the use of emollient creams. Results of palliative treatment are mixed. Toxic reactions may be associated with many of these medications. Dermatologic manifestations have been treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, low-dose corticosteroids, dimethyl sulfoxide, and edetate disodium; peripheral and internal-organ vascular obstruction, with alpha-adrenergic blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, and calcium-channel blockers. Antacids with alginic acid, histamine H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and cholinergic-acting agents may be used to relieve GI symptoms. Lung infections should be treated promptly with antibiotics. No drug therapy has been successful in reducing the incidence of fatal cardiac arrhythmias or in preventing cardiac fibrosis. Captopril and enalapril are essential in the control of SSc renal crisis. Penicillamine may hold promise as a remittive therapy. The immunosuppressive agents fluorouracil, cyclosporine, and methotrexate, which have shown limited effectiveness in preliminary studies, merit further investigation. No therapeutic agent has yet been shown to alter the course of SSc on a consistent or long-term basis. Toxicity and drug interactions remain a major concern in patient management, and aggressive monitoring is essential.", 
    "334": "Regional haemodynamic effects of DuP 753 were assessed in conscious unrestrained Brattleboro (i.e. vasopressin-deficient) rats, chronically instrumented with miniaturised pulsed Doppler flow probes and intravascular catheters. Responses to DuP 753 were assessed in water-replete animals and in animals following 14h water deprivation to render cardiovascular status dependent on the renin angiotensin system (RAS). In water-replete animals DuP 753 had little effect on mean arterial blood pressure, but there were dose-dependent tachycardias and increases in renal blood flow, associated with vasodilatations. There were also increases in mesenteric blood flow and vascular conductance, but these were not clearly dose-related; DuP 753 had no significant effects on hindquarters haemodynamics. In water-deprived animals DuP 753 caused dose-dependent hypotension, tachycardia, and renal and mesenteric vasodilatations; hindquarters vasodilatation was not dose-dependent. In both conditions, in the presence of DuP 753 (10 mg/kg), captopril had little additional effect. DuP 753 appears to be an extremely effective tool for assessing the role of the RAS in cardiovascular regulation.", 
    "335": "An attenuation of adrenergic activity during the inhibition of endogenous angiotensin II formation was evaluated by determining plasma norepinephrine concentration after a single oral administration of captopril compared to that after nifedipine in essential hypertension. Captopril produced a fall in mean arterial pressure (-24 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.01) which magnitude was the same as that gained by nifedipine (-22 +/- 3 mmHg, p less than 0.01). Reflex tachycardia due to hypotension was produced (+13 +/- 1 beats/min, p less than 0.01) after nifedipine but not after captopril (-1 +/- 2 beats/min, p greater than 0.05). Although the enhancement of plasma renin activity induced by captopril (+1.54 +/- 0.56 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05) was similar (p greater than 0.05) to that by nifedipine (+1.44 +/- 0.47 ng/ml/hr, p less than 0.05), plasma norepinephrine concentration increased less (p less than 0.01) after captopril (+100 +/- 23 ng/ml, p less than 0.05) than after nifedipine (+283 +/- 51 ng/ml, p less than 0.05). Thus, the diminished adrenergic activity is a likely candidate for the abolished reflex tachycardia after the inhibition of angiotensin I converting enzyme activity by captopril in essential hypertension.", 
    "336": "Two novel series of dihydrothiadiazole ring containing inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme have been designed and synthesized. The compounds are highly potent enzyme inhibitors and, as a consequence of conformational restriction, chemically stable with respect to undesirable cyclization reactions. The most interesting compound from this series, 5a (FPL 63547), is the monoethyl ester prodrug of the highly potent \"aminocarboxy\" inhibitor 5b (FPL 63674). It produces an antihypertensive effect of long duration in animal models after oral dosing. Unlike other ACE inhibitors, 5b is eliminated almost entirely by biliary clearance in the rat. The favorable pharmacological properties of 5a and 5b are rationalized in terms of their unique physicochemical profiles. The clear preference for biliary clearance seen with 5b is consistent with its lipophilicity and its high degree of net ionization at physiological pH, which results from the very low pKa of the C-terminus carboxylic acid function. FPL 63547 is presently undergoing clinical investigation in man.",

In this work we studied in vitro and in vivo the protective effect of captopril on the deleterious effect of Hg(++)-induced nonspecific membrane permeability changes to Ca++ and membrane de-energization. In vivo the administration of captopril prevented the toxic effects of mercury poisoning on membrane permeability, oxidative phosphorylation and Ca++ homeostasis. Moreover, captopril preserves kidney tissue morphology from Hg(++)-induced damage. The protective effect of captopril is most likely related to the existence of a sulfhydryl group in the drug.", 
    "338": "To investigate adherence to literature recommendations for administration of five cardiovascular drugs in relation to mealtimes, data from records of 183 adult patients in two short-term and two long-term care settings were tabulated. Ninety-three percent of patients taking quinidine sulfate and 85% of patients taking the other four study drugs received one or more doses incorrectly. Findings show that timing recommendations for dosing in relation to meals are not considered in these institutions when drug administration schedules are established. The practice of arbitrary schedule selection could have serious consequences, including adverse physiologic and financial impact on the patient from loss of therapeutic effectiveness or development of drug toxicosis. Medication schedules need to be designed to achieve the greatest drug bioavailability.", 
    "339": "The effect of chronic angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibition on the pressure-natriuresis relation was studied in Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Enalapril maleate (25 mg.kg-1.day-1 in drinking water) was started at 4-5 weeks of age. At 7-9 weeks of age, the pressure-natriuresis relation was studied while the rats were under Inactin anesthesia 1 week after the right kidney and adrenal gland were removed. Neural and hormonal influences on the remaining kidney were fixed by surgical renal denervation, adrenalectomy, and infusion of a hormone cocktail (330 microliters.kg-1.min-1) containing high levels of aldosterone, arginine vasopressin, hydrocortisone, and norepinephrine dissolved in 0.9% NaCl containing 1% albumin. Changes in renal function resulting from alterations in renal artery pressure were compared between enalapril-treated and control rats. Mean arterial pressure (+/- SEM) under anesthesia was 118 +/- 5, 94 +/- 4, 175 +/- 3, and 124 +/- 2 mm Hg for control Wistar-Kyoto (n = 10), enalapril-treated Wistar-Kyoto (n = 10), control spontaneously hypertensive (n = 9), and enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive (n = 9) rats, respectively. When renal artery pressure was set at values above approximately 125 mm Hg, control spontaneously hypertensive rats excreted less sodium and water than control Wistar-Kyoto rats. Enalapril treatment resulted in a significant and similar shift to the left of the pressure-natriuresis relation in both strains of rats so that a lower renal artery pressure was required to excrete a similar amount of sodium when compared with their respective untreated controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "340": "In order to investigate the physiological role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the control of vasopressin (VP) secretion, the VP responses to hypotension induced by hemorrhage (20 ml/kg, n = 10) or nitroprusside infusion (1-10 micrograms/kg.min, n = 9) were studied with or without blockade of ANG II formation by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in conscious rabbits. Administration of captopril (5 mg/kg, iv) caused a small decrease in mean arterial pressure but did not enhance the hypotensive response to subsequent hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion. The renin response to both stimuli was enhanced by captopril, whereas the increase in plasma ANG II concentration was attenuated. Plasma VP (PAVP) concentration increased during hemorrhage (2.0 +/- 0.2-113.6 +/- 47.7 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) and nitroprusside infusion (2.1 +/- 0.3-5.1 +/- 1.0 pg/ml, P less than 0.01). Captopril did not change basal plasma PAVP, nor did it attenuate the VP responses to hemorrhage or nitroprusside. Indeed, captopril tended to enhance the VP responses to hemorrhage (2.3 +/- 0.3-147.1 +/- 65.9 pg/ml) and nitroprusside infusion (1.9 +/- 0.2-15.4 +/- 6.0 pg/ml). The relationship between log PAVP and mean arterial pressure during hemorrhage and nitroprusside infusion in the presence of captopril was not different than in the absence of captopril. These results indicate that in conscious rabbits, the renin-angiotensin system does not contribute to the increase in VP secretion during hypotension induced by hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion.",

    "342": "Fifty-five patients with suspected renal artery stenosis underwent renography prior to performance of renal angiography. Renography was performed on two consecutive days using technetium-99m-diethylenetiamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) as an index of glomerular filtration rate and iodine-131-orthoiodohippurate (OIH) as an index of renal blood flow. Captopril (25 mg orally, crushed) was administered 1 hour before the second study. Renal artery stenosis was defined as a stenosis exceeding 70%. Renographic criteria were then established, retrospectively, to differentiate renal artery stenosis from essential hypertension based on (1) asymmetry of function and (2) the presence of captopril-induced changes.", 
    "343": "Renal artery stenosis was detected in 35 of 55 patients (21 with unilateral and 14 with bilateral stenosis). Three criteria were established for diagnosing renal artery stenosis: (1) a percent uptake of DTPA by the affected kidney of less than 40% of the combined bilateral uptake, (2) a delayed time to peak uptake of DTPA, which was more than 5 minutes longer in the affected kidney than in the contralateral kidney, (3) a delayed excretion of DTPA, with retention at 15 minutes, as a fraction of peak activity, more than 20% greater than in the contralateral kidney. The presence of one or more of these criteria was diagnostic of renal artery stenosis, with a sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 75%, respectively before captopril administration, and 94% and 95% after captopril administration. Lesser degrees of asymmetry (i.e., uptake of 40% to 50%) had very poor diagnostic specificity. Among patients with bilateral stenoses, asymmetry identified the more severely affected kidney, but the presence or absence of stenosis in the contralateral kidney could not be reliably determined. When pre- and post-captopril studies were compared, the presence of captopril-induced scintigraphic changes was a highly specific finding for renal artery stenosis, but occurred in only 51% of the cases. OIH scintigraphy provided similar results, with slightly lower sensitivity and specificity.", 
    "344": "Asymmetry of DTPA uptake, time to peak uptake, or retention seen on a single post-captopril renogram is a highly sensitive and specific finding in detecting renal artery stenosis but does not distinguish unilateral from bilateral disease. If renograms are obtained both before and after captopril administration, the presence of captopril-induced change is a highly specific finding for the detection of renal artery stenosis, but the sensitivity of this finding is low.",

Twenty-eight patients had normal or minimally decreased renal function (serum creatinine level 1.5 mg/dL or less) and 22 had renal insufficiency (serum creatinine level 1.8 mg/dL or more). Renography was performed 60 minutes after oral administration of 50 mg captopril or 10 minutes after intravenous injection of 40 micrograms/kg enalaprilat. Forty milligrams of furosemide were administered intravenously 2 minutes after injection of 131I-hippuran. The residual cortical activity (RCA) of 131I-hippuran was measured at 20 minutes.",

Conversely, RVH was present when 131I-hippuran cortical activity steadily increased throughout the test to reach 100% at 20 minutes. In azotemic patients with RCA between 31% and 100%, RVH was differentiated from intrinsic renal disease by obtaining a baseline renogram without ACE inhibition and comparing RCA in that study and RCA after ACE inhibition. If RCA increased (indicating worsening renal function) after ACE inhibition, RVH was likely; whereas, intrinsic renal disease was more likely if RCA remained unchanged or decreased (indicating improved renal function) with ACE inhibition. The test had a specificity of 95% and a sensitivity of 96% in this population. There was a direct correlation between the results of angioplasty or surgery on high blood pressure and the changes in RCA before and after intervention (n = 20).",

    "349": "Protein-induced increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), termed renal reserve, is said to be abrogated with the onset of renal disease. However, this notion is inconsistent with the results from animal studies which suggest that alterations in protein intake modulate the glomerular hemodynamics in experimental renal disease. Accordingly, 12 normal subjects and 15 patients with renal disease received a protein meal providing 1 g/kg body weight protein. The subjects were pretreated with either placebo or an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril. A significant (P less than 0.05) increase in inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance was noted in normal subjects as well as in patients with renal disease. The increase in GFR over basal values in normal subjects (28 +/- 9%), patients with moderate renal failure (20 +/- 13%), and advanced renal failure (21 +/- 14%) was not different. Plasma renin activity was unchanged following protein meal in the placebo studies although it increased following enalapril administration. Enalapril pretreatment did not alter the glomerular vasodilation and hyperfiltration following protein meal. We conclude that protein meal induces glomerular hyperfiltration in renal disease and that this protein-induced hyperfiltration is not mediated by angiotensin II. Because glomerular hyperfiltration is implicated in the progression of renal disease, these data suggest that even in patients who have advanced renal failure, high-protein diets may exert a detrimental effect on the kidney.", 
    "350": "Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and dietary protein restriction have been reported to reduce urinary protein losses in patients with chronic glomerular diseases. We evaluated these two therapies in 12 such patients ingesting a constant metabolic diet containing 1.6 g protein/kg body weight per day. After a steady-state was achieved during a 3-week baseline period, patients were randomly assigned to either enalapril, titrated to reduce mean arterial pressure by 10 mm Hg, or an isocaloric 0.8 g/kg protein diet. Five patients in each group completed 3 additional weeks of observation during the treatment period. Enalapril resulted in an average reduction in urinary protein and albumin losses of 26% and 33%, respectively, without reducing creatinine clearance. Albumin synthesis was unchanged and nitrogen balance increased slightly (+142.8 +/- 85.7 mmol/d [+2.0 +/- 1.2 g/d], P = 0.075). Dietary protein restriction had no consistent effect on proteinuria or albuminuria, whereas albumin synthesis (25.9 +/- 3.4 v 21.5 +/- 2.9 g/d/1.73 m2, P less than 0.05) and nitrogen balance (-135.6 +/- 92.8 mmol/d [-1.9 +/- 1.3 g/d], P = 0.10) decreased. Both therapies resulted in a modest increase in plasma potassium concentration. Whether the maintenance of albumin synthesis in the presence of a reduction in urinary protein losses will convey a long-term advantage to treatment of proteinuric patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors remains to be determined.", 
    "351": "Previous efforts to block the renin-angiotensin system in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) have focused on 2 distal sites in the system, the angiotensin-converting enzyme and the angiotensin II receptor. Recent work, however, has led to the development of agents that directly inhibit renin, the proximal step in the cascade. In this study, we investigated the hemodynamic effects of renin inhibition in 9 patients with chronic CHF by using enalkiren, a primate-selective, dipeptide renin inhibitor, which has been previously shown to suppress plasma renin activity and to lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The acute intravenous administration of enalkiren (1.0 mg/kg) produced increases in cardiac index (2.0 +/- 0.3 to 2.3 +/- 0.1 liter/min/m2) and stroke volume index (26 +/- 3 to 34 +/- 4 ml/m2) and decreases in left ventricular filling pressure (31 +/- 3 to 25 +/- 3 mm Hg), mean right atrial pressure (15 +/- 1 to 13 +/- 2 mm Hg), heart rate (78 +/- 5 to 72 +/- 6 beats/min) and systemic vascular resistance (2,199 +/- 594 to 1,339 +/- 230 dynes.s.cm-5) (all p less than 0.01 to 0.05). These observations indicate that renin inhibition produces hemodynamic benefits in patients with chronic CHF and could potentially provide a novel approach to interfering with the renin-angiotensin system in patients with this disorder.",

The observed odds ratio for cough among ACE inhibitor users was 2.3 (95 percent CI, 1.02 to 5.00). This study is the first systematic investigation of frequency and characteristics of ACE inhibitor cough that includes a control group. Our results suggest that cough may more frequently accompany treatment with ACE inhibitors than has been previously reported. We recommend that physicians specifically inquire about cough in patients taking an ACE inhibitor. Recognition of this side effect may prevent unnecessary testing and treatment of patients receiving ACE inhibitors.",

The metabolic derangements of both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) result in widespread end-organ damage, including progressive kidney failure. Since its initial description in 1936, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy has progressively increased, and it is now the most common cause of newly diagnosed end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring renal replacement therapy in the United States.

The purported efficacy of some antihypertensive agents in the treatment of psychiatric conditions is also discussed. Beneficial as well as adverse neuropsychiatric effects are reviewed.

We have studied the long-term effects of treating hypertension with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, and a calcium channel blocker, nicardipine, on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and on renal function in 16 patients with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance ranging between 17 and 62 ml/min). After 1 year of treatment, these agents caused a similar decrease in blood pressure. Only enalapril, however, caused a significant decrease in UAE (from 641 +/- 98 to 292 +/- 47 mg/24 h, p less than 0.01), whereas UAE did not change in the group treated with nicardipine (675 +/- 78 vs. 601 +/- 75 mg/24 h). Creatinine clearance at the beginning of the study was similar in the group treated with enalapril and in the group treated with nicardipine (35 +/- 3.6 vs. 40 +/- 4.1 ml/min). After 1 year of follow-up, creatinine clearance remained unchanged in both groups of patients. These studies demonstrate that both enalapril and nicardipine can effectively reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. Enalapril but not nicardipine, however, appears to reduce urinary albumin excretion in these patients. Whether the reduction in UAE has any significant impact on the progression of renal disease remains to be established.",

The coexisting risk for coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction should not be increased by undesired drug effects on the plasma lipoprotein profile. Late lesions of diabetes mellitus (nephropathy, neuropathy) have also to be taken into account. Consequently angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, if necessary combined with calcium channel blockers, should be administered first. If blood pressure is thus not sufficiently controlled, alpha-adrenergic blockers, vasodilating agents or sympatholytics may be added. Once insulin treatment is installed, or if required for other reasons (nephropathy, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia), also diuretics and beta-adrenergic blockers are indicated in antihypertensive treatment of diabetic patients.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are new means for the therapy of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Captopril seems to be effective at an early stage of heart failure. It slows down or even inhibits the progression of heart failure. New aspects of therapy have been revealed.

    "360": "Overall 42 normotensive patients suffering from type I diabetes mellitus without proteinuria were examined for the effect of hyperfiltration on renal glomerular function and for changes in glomerular function seen during medicamentous treatment of hyperfiltration. Glomerular function was evaluated from the basal level of glomerular filtration (GF), the status of filtration reserves (i. e. according to the dynamics of the GF level in response to oral protein administration), and from the magnitude of albuminuria. Three groups of diabetes mellitus patients were distinguished: with filtration reserves, with decreased filtration reserves, and with no reserves. All the three groups did not differ in the age, diabetes standing or the degree of carbohydrate disorders compensation (HBA1c). Still, the patients with no filtration reserves significantly differ from the other groups with a high level of GF and albuminuria. In 9 patients, a study was made of the effect produced by captopril (an inhibitor of the angiotensin-transforming enzyme) on filtration reserves and albuminuria. After 3 to 6 months of the treatment five patients with no filtration reserves manifested a fall of the basal level of GF down to normal, the recovery of filtration reserves, and a decline of albuminuria. It is assumed that elimination of hyperfiltration due to the treatment with the inhibitors of the angiotensin-transforming enzyme may be an effective means of diabetic nephropathy prevention.", 
    "361": "1. The interaction between bradykinin (BK) and the renin-angiotensin system was studied in conscious, catheterized rats. 2. Intravenous injection of BK induced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure in normotensive Wistar and Wistar-Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril markedly enhanced the effect of BK, such that the dose-response curve shifted significantly to the left in all three strains. 3. In a second series of experiments, captopril did not change basal blood pressure, but blocked the pressor response to angiotensin I (AI), but not angiotensin II (AII). 4. The partial agonist Sar1-Ala8-angiotensin II (SAR) increased blood pressure and blocked the pressor response to subsequent AII treatment. 5. After pretreatment with BK (50 micrograms/kg), captopril evoked a decrease in blood pressure, while still blocking the effect of AI. 6. After pretreatment with BK, SAR decreased blood pressure, while still antagonizing the action of AII. 7. These results suggest that ACE plays a role in the inactivation of circulating BK in normotensive and hypertensive rats. Conversely, BK can influence the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, probably by interacting with ACE.", 
    "362": "Strenuous physical exercise causes transient proteinuria and renal hemodynamic changes: decrease of renal blood flow and to a lesser extent of the glomerular filtration rate, and an increase of the filtration fraction. However, the mechanisms of these modifications are still poorly understood. In order to elucidate them we performed maximal exercise tests on 8 untrained healthy volunteers after inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by captopril, the sympathetic nervous system by a beta-blocking drug (acebutolol) or an alpha-blocking drug (prazosin) and the prostaglandin system by indomethacin. Urinary albumin excretion was measured in every subject first at rest (AB) and then after exercise (AA) performed successively without and with blockade by each of theses drugs. AA-AB difference in the captopril test (12.04 +/- 6.11 micrograms/min) compared to that in the control test (68.91 +/- 25.18 micrograms/min) was significantly reduced (p less than 0.02). This difference remained unchanged after acebutolol (59.87 +/- 21.91 micrograms/min, p = 0.62), prazosin (35.23 +/- 27.80 micrograms/min, p = 0.21) and indomethacin (55.21 +/- 28.43 micrograms/min, p = 0.35). There was a negative correlation between the lowering of AA elevation and the rise in plasma renin activity in the captopril test (r = 0.64; p less than 0.03). Only acebutolol decreased systolic blood pressure significantly. These results suggest that the RAS plays a major role in postexercise proteinuria. We hypothesize that stimulation of this system induces an increase of efferent glomerular artery constriction and consequently of glomerular transcapillary pressure and the filtration fraction. Captopril seems able to prevent these hemodynamic changes.", 
    "363": "There is much circumstancial and some direct evidence in humans to suggest that a high consumption of salt predisposes communities and individuals to the development of essential hypertension. Restriction of salt intake in the diet lowers blood pressure in many subjects with high blood pressure and this fall in blood pressure is mediated in part by a diminished renin response to sodium restriction as hypertension develops. The effect of sodium restriction, like diuretics, is additive to many blood pressure lowering drugs, particularly those that inhibit the renin system such as beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.", 
    "364": "There is considerable interest in the ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors not only to lower blood pressure, but also to reverse hypertension-induced remodelling of the circulation. Recently published data would suggest that treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats from an early age with ACE inhibitors will prevent the development of the expected changes in the resistance vessels as the animals age and that withdrawal of treatment is followed by a lag period before the blood pressure rises. Such findings appear to be contrary to those obtained with other hypertensive drugs where morphological changes are not as effectively attenuated and blood pressure rises rapidly after withdrawal of treatment. There is some evidence for a relationship between the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in this area and lipid solubility. This raises the possibility that the mechanism at work is related to the inhibition of tissue-located renin-angiotensin systems both in vascular smooth muscle and elsewhere, possibly in the central nervous system. An overall review of the literature indicates that treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats with ACE inhibitors can result in prolonged reduction of blood pressure, even after treatment is withdrawn. Comparisons with other treatments suggest that it is easier to reduce blood pressure than to reverse vascular structure. However, achieving a reversal in morphological changes in resistance vessels as well as controlling blood pressure may be important for reducing the mortality from ischaemic heart disease. ACE inhibitors may have a direct effect on reversal of vascular structure, but other sites of action may also be important in this aspect of their action.", 
    "365": "A general method for the rapid verification of both identity and content of complete solid drug formulations has been devised. Infrared spectra for the samples were recorded using the diffuse reflectance technique, and specially written software was employed to identify the type of formulation and level of active ingredient. This software was devised to ensure reliable use when applied by those with minimal operator skills. Three differing drug tablet formulations containing simvastatin, enalapril maleate and lovastatin, as well as a capsule formulation containing finastride were studied. Adequate precision was obtained to reliably verify drug dosage levels. Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometers were evaluated for use with the method. The MIR instrument allowed sufficient resolution and spectral/structural selectivity to reliably verify correctness of either of two near derivative drugs necessarily present in the same clinical study. Drug tablet and capsule dosage levels tested ranged from 0.2 to 40 mg of drug. Approximately 1% (w/w) of the drug in the formulation was the minimum amount determined. Parameters affecting method ruggedness in routine use were optimized. Experimental addition of an extraneous material to a simvastatin formulation was easily detected and flagged by the routine test procedure. Subsequent data retrieval and searching against spectral libraries was used to demonstrate identification of the additive.", 
    "366": "The aim of this single blind, placebo controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of quinapril in mild to moderate hypertension. Thirty-six patients (from 32 to 64 years old, mean 54.8 +/- 8.84) with diastolic blood pressure (DP) greater than or equal to 96 mmHg and less than or equal to 114 mmHg were enrolled. After a two week wash-out, a placebo was administered for two weeks and than for 12 weeks 20 mg of quinapril u.i.d. At the eighth week if DP was not less than less than or equal to 94 mmHg 40 mg of quinapril was administered. Blood pressure was evaluated at the onset of the study, at the beginning of every step and every 4 weeks. Mean DP and systolic pressure were respectively 159.17 +/- 11.43 and 101.14 +/- 4.39 at the enrolling time, 159.72 +/- 9.41 and 101.86 +/- 3.45 after the wash-out period, 152.78 +/- 9.22 and 98.33 +/- 2.9 after the placebo period, 150 +/- 9.34 and 95.28 +/- 3.52, 144.72 +/- 8.89 and 92.22 +/- 4.32, 140.25 +/- 8.21 and 88.24 +/- 5.27 after 4, 8, 12 weeks of treatment.", 
    "367": "Captopril (CAS 62571-86-2) may be beneficial for the treatment of diabetes because of its activating effect on peripheral glucose consumption besides its well known blood pressure degradation. The glucose oxidation has been found to be activated by captopril in thrombocytes and mononuclear leucocytes, cell types which are usually considered to be independent from insulin. Because the oxidation of pyruvate labelled in position C-1 but not of 2-14C-pyruvate and of 1-14C-acetate was enhanced, captopril most probably stimulated the pyruvate decarboxylation reaction. The metabolism of glucose labelled in positions 1 and 6 was equally activated by captopril indicating another step which may be affected by captopril.", 
    "368": "The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril has been shown to cause resetting of the arterial baroreflex to a lower pressure without a change in gain. The present study was conducted to determine whether captopril altered the relationship between arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity in conscious quietly resting dogs. Fourteen instrumented dogs were given 2 mg/kg iv of captopril; 10 min later postcaptopril measurements were made. Six of the fourteen dogs were pretreated with cyclooxygenase inhibitor (indomethacin or meclofenamate) before administration of captopril. Renal nerve activity and hemodynamics were measured in a final group of eight dogs in which arterial pressure was lowered with a graded infusion of sodium nitroprusside. Captopril caused a small but significant decrease in arterial pressure. This decrease in arterial pressure was accompanied by a significant increase in heart rate; however, renal sympathetic nerve activity was significantly reduced. In contrast, dogs receiving nitroprusside exhibited an increase in both heart rate and renal sympathetic nerve activity in response to similar decreases in arterial pressure. Dogs that received cyclooxygenase inhibitor showed reduced arterial pressure in response to captopril, increased heart rate, and increased renal sympathetic nerve activity. This study is the first to report a decrease in sympathetic nerve activity in response to captopril in an awake chronically instrumented animals. These data suggest that captopril's ability to augment prostaglandin synthesis is responsible for the observed sympathoinhibition.", 
    "369": "Additive combination studies of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, captopril, and a renin inhibitor, ditekiren (U-71038), were carried out in conscious sodium-depleted and sodium replete cynomolgus monkeys. The agents elicited dose-additive hypotensive responses regardless of the order of drug administration in sodium-depleted monkeys. A dose-additive blood pressure response was also observed when the administration of captopril was preceded by ditekiren in conscious sodium replete monkeys. None of the animals in these groups exhibited significant alterations of heart rate. An apparent over-additive hypotensive response, accompanied by tachycardia, occurred in sodium replete monkeys when ditekiren was administered after captopril. It was proposed that the captopril-induced hyperreninemia may have allowed the blood pressure to become partially renin-dependent and therefore susceptible to the inhibitory action of ditekiren. The results of these studies suggested that both ditekiren and captopril elicited cardiovascular effects in conscious cynomolgus monkeys via a decreased formation of angiotensin II.", 
    "370": "The acute regional hemodynamic effects of spirapril diacid, a novel nonsulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and enalapril diacid at an equidepressor dose were examined in anesthetized dogs by simultaneously measuring renal, coronary, vertebral arterial and aortic blood flow. Spirapril diacid (30 micrograms/kg, i.v.) lowered aortic pressure and increased aortic and renal blood flow associated with no marked change in heart rate, myocardial contractility, vertebral and coronary blood flow in a similar manner to enalapril diacid (30 micrograms/kg, i.v.). Both inhibitors thus produced an increase in stroke volume and a decrease of the rate-pressure product. The decrease of renal vascular resistance after administration of both agents was greater than that in vertebral and coronary vascular beds. A relatively more prolonged renal vasodilatation and a shortened coronary vasodilatation were seen with spirapril diacid as compared with enalapril diacid, despite practically identical reductions in total peripheral resistance. Each of the drugs markedly inhibited the pressor and renal vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin I. These results indicate that the two inhibitors exhibit a similar profile of regional differences in vasodilatory effects, although they might display different durations of regional vasodilatation.", 
    "371": "We examined the possible involvement of angiotensin II in the modulation of circulating norepinephrine produced by acute sodium restriction in essential hypertensive patients (n = 18). Sodium restriction potentiated plasma level of norepinephrine in parallel with an increased plasma renin activity (r = 0.81, F = 31.2, p less than 0.05 given by the percent changes). An intravenous infusion of sarcosine-1, isoleucine-8 angiotensin II produced a significant fall in mean arterial pressure (-6 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.05) in patients on sodium restriction but not before sodium restriction, while the infusion of the antagonist produced a greater decrease (p less than 0.05) in plasma norepinephrine with sodium restriction (-158 +/- 23 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) when compared to that obtained before sodium restriction (-91 +/- 11 pg/ml, p less than 0.05). A single oral administration of an angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril caused a greater fall (p less than 0.01) in mean arterial pressure after sodium restriction (-32 +/- 3 mmHg, p less than 0.05) compared to that given before (-21 +/- 3 mmHg, p less than 0.05). However, sodium restriction did not affect the magnitude of reflex increase in plasma norepinephrine to hypotension evoked by captopril (from +88 +/- 16 pg/ml to +87 +/- 17 pg/ml; p greater than 0.05). It can be interpreted that acute sodium depletion results in a substantial contribution of angiotensin II to the expression of hyperadrenergic activity.", 
    "372": "An analytical method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of a novel orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (CGS 16617) and a stable isotope-labeled analog. Both compounds are isolated from human plasma using an ion-exchange column, derivatized with pentafluoropropionic anhydride and pentafluoropropanol, and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. After splitless injection on a methyl-silicon column, the compound is detected using negative ion chemical ionization with nitrous oxide as a reagent gas. CGS 16617 labeled with four deuteriums and two 13C is used as an internal standard. The accuracy and precision of the method, expressed as the overall mean +/- SD recovery obtained from two sets of 36 quality-control samples used during a clinical study (concentration range 0.2-100 ng ml-1 plasma), was 96.1 +/- 16.2% for unlabeled drug and 97.6 +/- 14.4% for the D4-labeled drug (concentration range 0.2-100 ng ml-1 plasma). The limit of quantification using 1 ml plasma is 0.2 ng ml-1 for both labeled and unlabeled drug.", 
    "373": "Bleeding time is prolonged following resection of kidney tissue as well as after ureteral occlusion. Bilateral nephrectomy raises bleeding time from 17 to 67 min, and blood loss can be increased from 2 to 12 microliters/min. Plasmatic coagulation factors remain unchanged in uremic rats. There is no influence of various surgical interventions producing uremia on function of thrombocytes. In rats with intact kidney function and following bilateral nephrectomy a diminution of bleeding time is demonstrable after administration of histamine or captopril. Shortening of bleeding time by the antifibrinolytic substance p-aminomethylbenzoic acid seems to indicate an increased fibrinolytic activity in uremic rats.", 
    "374": "It was demonstrated recently that a local renin-angiotensin system (RAS) exists in the heart and coronary vessels, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors can protect the heart from ischemia. Eight patients with NYHA class II-IV subjected to valve replacement were studied in protecting the heart from global ischemia with captopril during open heart surgery. After the ascending aorta was clamped, 500-1000 ml 4 degrees C modified St. Thomas No 1 cardioplegic solution containing 0.058-0.23 mmol/L captopril was perfused into coronary arteries under pressure until the electrocardiogram showed disappearance of myocardial electroactivity. The cardioplegic perfusion was repeated every 30 minutes thereafter during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). All the hearts rebeat after reperfusion either spontaneously or from defibrillation without any trouble. Three patients developed an A-V dissociation which returned to sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation after a tiny dose of dopamine or isoprenaline intravenously. All the patients weaned from the CPB easily with a stable heart rate and a reasonable MAP. None of them needed inotropic support, even those with severe heart failure before operation did not either, and all recovered uneventfully.", 
    "375": "The effect of central renin-angiotensin system (RAS) on one-kidney Grollman hypertension during the maintaining phase and its mechanism were investigated in rats. The arterial blood pressure (ABP) and the content of angiotensin II (A II) and norepinephrine (NE) in brain regions was measured respectively. 4 weeks after operation the ABP was elevated significantly, and it sustained at high level 8 weeks post-operatively. However, ABP in the control group underwent no significant changes at the same period. The A II and the NE content in the brain regions of the operated group were significantly higher than in those of the age-matched control group. During the maintaining phase of hypertension captopril (150 micrograms/10 microliters) was injected into the lateral cerebroventricle at 0.5 h, 1.0 h and 1.5 h respectively, and ABP and content of A II and NE were determined at the corresponding time. The results showed that the above three parameters decreased consistently at 0.5 h and 1.0 h, and increased gradually at 1.5 h, suggesting that the central RAS might play an important role in the maintaining phase of one-kidney Grollman hypertension in rats.", 
    "376": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) plays an important role in the regulation of renal vascular resistance, glomerular function and tubular reabsorption. Systemic infusion of ANG II produces dose-dependent decreases in renal blood flow (RBF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and filtration coefficient, and increases in filtration fraction. Intrarenally generated ANG II is also critical to alterations in cortical and juxtamedullary glomerular ultrafiltration. On the other hand, pharmacological blockade of the systemical and intrarenal generation or action of ANG II elicits increases in RBF and pressure-associated changes in GFR. In vivo micropuncture experiments demonstrate that peritubular capillary microperfusion of 10(-7) M ANG II results in decreases in single nephron GFR and glomerular capillary pressure. Blockade of ANG II activity by ANG converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor markedly attenuates, whereas intravenous or peritubular capillary infusion of exogenous ANG II enhances tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mediated changes in the stop flow pressure. Moreover, infusion of exogenous ANG II during conditions of ACE blockade partially restores the feedback responsiveness, suggesting a specific role of ANG II as a modulator of TGF system. Besides its effects on intrarenal hemodynamics, ANG II directly or indirectly affects renal sodium excretion. Micropuncture and microperfusion studies have shown that ANG II exerts a dose-dependent biphasic effect on proximal tubular sodium reabsorption via apical Na(+)-H+ exchange. A stimulatory effects of ANG II at low dose (10(-12)-10(-9) M) and an inhibitory effect at higher dose (10(-7)-10(-5) M) have been observed in the cortical and juxtamedullary nephron preparations. The stimulatory effect of ANG II on proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium seems associated with reduction in cAMP and/or activation of protein kinase C, whereas cytosolic free calcium surge activated by ANG II may be part of the cellular message that inhibits proximal tubular reabsorptive function. ANG III, a metabolite of ANG II, also enters substantial influence on renal function. In contrast to the systemic pressor effect, the two peptides are approximately equipotent in their actions on the renal vasculature. Superimposed administration of either ANG II or ANG III during ACE inhibition completely reverses the GFR and renal excretory responses to ACE inhibition. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injections of ANG II and ANG III in rats inhibit renal nerve activity and cause a comparable renal effect which can be blocked by Ile7-ANG III and potentiated by bestatin, suggesting that the heptapeptide may also play an active role in the regulation of sodium excretion by actions on renal hemodynamics and tubules.", 
    "377": "Little is known concerning the long-term drug management of chronic heart failure (CHF) in old patients (greater than or equal to 75 years). Accordingly, this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial compared the long-term (over 6 months) effect of captopril (37.5-75 mg/day) and of ibopamine (150-300 mg/day) on exercise testing, symptoms and subjective feeling of well-being, in 150 CHF elderly patients (mean age 75 years) under treatment with digitalis and/or diuretics. During an additional open follow-up of approximately 1.5 years, morbid events and deaths were also recorded. Captopril and ibopamine performed better (p less than 0.01) than placebo, improving the 6-min walking distance (captopril from 300 to 404 m, ibopamine from 282 to 385 m; placebo from 283 to 299 m). NYHA status, symptom score and patients' global assessment. The difference between the active study drugs was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). Complicating events, including diuretic use, frequency of hospitalization, worsening of CHF and deaths, were grouped by patient-years. These events were significantly (p less than 0.01) lower (captopril: 28/75 patient-years; ibopamine 33/74 patient-years) in the active treatment groups with respect to placebo (58/96 patient-years). Captopril and ibopamine showed a different safety profile. Creatinine increase (2 patients), symptomatic hypotension (4 patients), hyperkalemia (2 patients) and upper respiratory symptoms were mostly associated with captopril treatment. Gastrointestinal adverse events were observed in 11 patients under ibopamine treatment. The study provides evidence of the clinical usefulness of both captopril or ibopamine in the long-term treatment of CHF in old patients. The safety profile of each drug will suggest the preferred therapeutic application.", 
    "378": "The captopril test was performed on 49 children of whom 36 were hypertensive, and the remainder were normotensive but were at risk for developing hypertension because of scarred kidneys secondary to vesico-ureteral reflux. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored in fasting supine patients throughout the duration of the test. Blood was taken for measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA); then captopril (0.7 mg/kg of body weight) was administered orally. A second blood sample was taken for PRA at 90 min postcaptopril. The mean (SEM) PRA at 90 min was 11.90 (4.01) ng/l/s [42.84 (14.44) ng/ml/h] in 7 patients with renovascular disease. In 4 patients with essential hypertension corresponding values were 0.88 (0.38) ng/l/s [3.17 (1.37) ng/ml/h]. Patients with other renal diseases showed variable values. Some individuals had PRA values as high as those of patients with renovascular disease, but the etiology of their hypertension was usually clinically evident. Our preliminary data would suggest that the captopril test may help differentiate between patients with essential hypertension and those with renovascular disease, or may help select patients that should be followed up by more definitive diagnostic procedures.", 
    "379": "In congestive heart failure renal hemodynamics are characterized by a decrease of fractional renal blood flow (renal fraction of the cardiac output) and marked changes of the intrarenal circulation. The latter consists of cortical hypocirculation and an enhanced medullary blood flow in the presence of a relative rise in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This compensatory increment of GFR is mediated by a stimulation of prostaglandins (dilatation of vas afferens) as well as the renin-angiotensin- and adrenergic systems (contraction of vas efferens). Therapy with ACE inhibitors influences renal function in a complex manner. A decline in GFR resulting in the worst case in acute renal failure (ARF) may be caused by two pathogenetic possibilities: 1. critical reduction in renal perfusion pressure (below 70 mm Hg) and/or 2. loss of the autoregulation of GFR by relaxation of the constricted vas efferens induced by stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-systems (RAS). Activation of the RAS might be a consequence of severe renal hypocirculation as well as a diuretic induced volume and sodium depletion (contraction of the effective arterial blood volume). On the other hand, ACE inhibitors may improve renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. This may be due to a rise in cardiac output, dilatation of vas efferens and occasionally vas afferens and an increase of the ultrafiltration coefficient. The deterioration of renal function caused by ACE-inhibitors may be prevented by avoiding a volume and sodium deficit (withdrawal or reduction of diuretics) and careful titration of the ACE-inhibitor starting with lowest dosages.", 
    "380": "If ACE-inhibitors are considered for therapy in patients with heart failure, the actual renal function has to be taken into account. In patients with reduced intravascular volume, e.g. during therapy with diuretics, the renin-angiotensin system is activated. In this situation, the renin-angiotensin-system contributes to the maintenance of arterial blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate by angiotensin II mediated vasoconstriction in vas efferens and systemic circulation. A sudden complete inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system therefore may cause a pronounced decrease in blood pressure and a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (impaired renal excretory function). In patients with heart failure concomitant chronic renal failure, the use of ACE-inhibitors is without major risk; however, the clinical efficacy may be limited. This does not apply to patients with diabetes, where the risk for impairment of renal function is increased. The potential advantage of short acting ACE-inhibitors such as captopril may clinically be relevant only in patients with very advanced severe heart failure and low arterial pressure. In any case, it is recommended to start ACE-inhibitors with a low dose and withdraw diuretics one or two days before in order to restore the intravascular volume.", 
    "381": "Recently it has been recognized that even minor elevations of blood pressure contribute to progression of renal failure. Furthermore it has been documented that antihypertensive treatment retards progression of renal failure. Despite impressive experimental data firm clinical evidence, incontrovertible on biostatistical grounds, is not yet available to document that converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) are superior to alternative antihypertensive agents with respect to halting progression. CEI undoubtedly reduce albuminuria, independent of their effect on systemic blood pressure, and this is related to alterations of glomerular permeability. Recent experimental data suggest that growth processes in damaged kidneys are an important aspect of progression. It is a fascinating perspective, but yet unproven, that CEI interfere with these processes.", 
    "382": "In the treatment of heart failure ACE inhibitors gained a unique position because of their beneficial effect on prognosis. The most likely explanation is their influence on factors that determine progression of the disease. These are: progressive deterioration of central hemodynamics, impairment of coronary perfusion, further activation of vasopressor systems, imbalance of sodium and water homeostasis and occurrence of malignant arrhythmias. ACE inhibitors have been shown to modulate these factors in a positive manner. In addition, they may also act by modulating factors, which may exert harmful effects on cardiac function in long term. These are: prevention and regression of the hypertrophy of the left ventricle as well as the media of resistance vessels, prevention of restenosis following PTCA, prevention of cyclosporin-induced premature coronary artery sclerosis, and correction of an impaired glucose metabolism. Whereas the positive effects of ACE inhibitors in the treatment of heart failure are well documented, their value for preventing heart failure has not been established, yet.", 
    "383": "Acute myocardial ischemia results from an increased cardiac workload in presence of a critical coronary stenosis (demand ischemia), coronary occlusion (supply ischemia) or a combination of both. It is complicated by cardiac arrhythmias and deterioration of function of ischemic myocardium and results in an increased load and dilatation of non-ischemic myocardium. Cardiac protection in acute myocardial ischemia can be related to preservation of coronary blood flow, function of ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium or prevention of cardiac arrhythmias. In control animals and humans, ACE-inhibitors have no major effect on coronary blood flow. Myocardial ischemia raises plasma-renin-activity, angiotensin I-conversion by passage through coronary circulation, and plasma-angiotensin-II-concentrations. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin-II-receptor blockers increase coronary blood flow during myocardial ischemia. Other mechanisms (bradykinin potentiation) may be involved. We found a potentiation of the coronary dilatory effect of the neuropeptide neurotensin (which is probably mediated by prostaglandins) by ACE-inhibitor. ACE-inhibitor may delay infarct development in animal experiments and improve function of ischemic myocardium. The importance of early dilatation of non-ischemic myocardium is unknown and it is unclear whether it may be prevented by an ACE-inhibitor as was shown for late dilatation. Studies on the effect of ACE-inhibitors in exercise-induced angina pectoris are controversial. An antiischemic and coronary dilatory effect has been shown by invasive studies in patients. A preliminary study in unstable angina pectoris was positive. Beneficial hemodynamic and antiarrhythmic effects (as well as excessive hypotension, however) have been shown in patients with acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "384": "Local inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE, kininase II) produces both-attenuation of angiotensin II generation and of bradykinin degradation. To delineate the participation of bradykinin in the cardioprotective actions of ACE inhibitors, experiments were performed in rats and dogs with cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injuries. In isolated perfused working rat hearts with regional myocardial ischemia, bradykinin in concentrations as low as 1 x 10(-9) M increases coronary flow and reduces the incidence and duration of reperfusion ventricular fibrillation. In addition, enzyme activities of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase as well as lactate output were decreased in the venous effluent of bradykinin-perfused hearts, which also showed improved cardiodynamic and metabolic parameters. Even concentrations of bradykinin lower than 1 x 10(-10) M, which were without influence on coronary flow, exerted comparable beneficial metabolic effects connected with reduced incidence and duration of ventricular fibrillation. Combined perfusions with threshold concentrations of bradykinin (1 x 10(-12) M) and the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat (2,58 x 10(-9) M), which were ineffective given alone, resulted in a marked cardioprotective effect. Perfusion with angiotensin II (1 x 10(-9) M) aggravated reperfusion arrhythmias and worsened myocardial metabolism. Bradykinin perfusion prevented this deterioration in a concentration-dependent manner. The bradykinin antagonist D-Arg-[Hyp2, Thi5,8, D-Phe7]-bradykinin (1 x 10(-5)) completely abolished the cardioprotective effects of bradykinin or the ACE inhibitor. However, higher concentrations of bradykinin (1 x 10(-7) M) or ramiprilat (2,58 x 10(-5) M) reversed these properties of the bradykinin antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "385": "Arterial hypertension and proteinuric nephropathy are common features in diabetic patients. In streptozotocin-diabetic rats, it has been possible to reduce the blood pressure and proteinuria by converting enzyme inhibitors, and so slowing the decline of kidney function. These results have been confirmed in diabetic patients affected by arterial hypertension and persistent proteinuria. However, up to now it has not been clear if these favorable renal effects are related specifically to converting enzyme inhibition. In the attempt to clarify this last point, from a practical as well as from a speculative point of view, 12 type 2 diabetic outpatients affected by mild to moderate arterial hypertension and persistent macroalbuminuria (greater than 250 mg/daily, at least on three consecutive occasions) without any other signs of renal diseases were studied. In a randomized sequence and in a double blind fashion, after a washout period of 3 weeks, the patients underwent pharmacological treatment which consisted of enalapril 20 mg o.d., chlorthalidone 12.5 mg o.d., atenolol 50 mg o.d. and placebo o.d. Each treatment lasted 45 days. Kidney function, blood pressure and heart rate were checked at the beginning and at the end of each treatment, while urinary albumin excretion was measured at the end of the 4th, 5th, and 6th week of each treatment. Blood pressure significantly decreased in a similar fashion after each active treatment, while kidney function did not change significantly. Urinary albumin excretion rate significantly decreased after enalapril and atenolol, but did not change after chlorthalidone. According to these results we can hypothesize that the inhibition of tissue angiotensin formation and its related change on the glomerular permeability, rather than renal and systemic hemodynamic features, seem to be the common mechanisms by which both enalapril as well as atenolol decrease the albuminuria in our patients.", 
    "386": "Inhibitors of the angiotensin conversion enzyme are used more and more for the treatment of hypertension patients. In this literature-review the efficiency of these drugs in lowering the blood pressure of aged patients is examined, as well as their relation to age and their influence on the morbidity and mortality of older people.", 
    "387": "A major incentive in inhibitor research is that control of limited proteolysis constitutes a valuable pharmacological tool. Protease inhibitors have proved to be successful in influencing pathogenesis in many experimental models but a breakthrough to use in human therapy has mainly been restricted to aprotinin and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, the success of ACE inhibitors as pharmacological tools in hypertension has proved to be a strong stimulant for new protease inhibitor approaches to drug therapy. While emphasis in the search for next generations of ACE inhibitors may move from the circulation renin-angiotensin system to the local tissue systems, including heart, brain and genital tract, persistent and insightful design of renin inhibitors has already yielded highly specific molecules with potent activities in several in vivo models. The development of orally effective long-acting inhibitors will finally allow an evaluation to be made of their therapeutic profile with regard to the family of ACE inhibitors. The close relationship between renin and HIV-1 protease presents an exceptional opportunity for transfer of the knowledge acquired in renin inhibitor development during the past decade, to an accelerated generation of specific HIV-1 protease inhibitors as effective agents in treatment of AIDS. The self-assembly of 2 identical monomers into a symmetrical structure in HIV-1 protease is not only an elegant way to create an active enzyme while encoding a minimal amount of genetic information, but is also in concordance with the bilobular active-site found in mammalian aspartic proteases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "388": "There is considerable evidence to suggest that isolated tissues have the capacity to generate angiotensin II and that angiotensin II thus generated may enhance noradrenergic neurotransmission. In the present study the possibility that there may be local formation of angiotensin II within the rat vena cava and its consequence to noradrenergic transmission has been investigated. The angiotensin II precursors, angiotensin I and a synthetic tetradecapeptide renin substrate, each enhanced the stimulation-induced efflux of radioactivity from tissues previously incubated with 3H-noradrenaline. The effects of angiotensin I were blocked by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and the receptor antagonist saralasin, indicating local conversion to angiotensin II. The effect of the tetradecapeptide was blocked by saralasin, but not by captopril, suggesting either a direct effect of this peptide or conversion to angiotensin II by a pathway not involving angiotensin converting enzyme. The beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline enhanced noradrenergic transmission in the rat vena cava, relaxed guinea-pig trachea precontracted with carbachol and increased heart rate in rat isolated atria. Captopril and saralasin blocked the effect of isoprenaline in the vena cava, but did not alter its effects in the atria or trachea. This suggests that in the rat vena cava the facilitation of noradrenergic transmission by isoprenaline may involve stimulation of local angiotensin II production.", 
    "389": "We present preliminary data of a study comparing captopril, a short acting, with lisinopril, a long acting ACE-inhibitor in 8 of 12 projected patients with severe chronic heart failure (NYHA III-IV) and one additional risk factor (e.g. diabetes mellitus, renal failure). The 8 patients were treated in a cross over design for 12 weeks with either drug. While lisinopril improved NYHA-class in all patients, captopril reached this goal in only 3. Renal function was stable in all patients. Captopril influenced hormones (renin, aldosterone, norepinephrine, epinephrine) and microalbuminuria less than lisinopril. The number of adverse reactions was smaller in lisinopril treated patients. These preliminary data demonstrate at least an equal efficacy of lisinopril compared to captopril in high risk patients with severe chronic heart failure.", 
    "390": "Data from the lisinopril-captopril comparison trial (6), as well as other data (1, 8, 14, 10) indicate that both long- and short-acting ACEI are effective and safe for the treatment of CHF. An improved effect on LV function and signs and symptoms of CHF as a result of more prolonged unloading of the heart by long-acting ACEI is suggested by the lisinopril-captopril comparison trial, but requires confirmation. An effect on renal function is expected with ACEI treatment of CHF, i.e., increase in BUN and serum creatinine; the greater increase in BUN by lisinopril as compared to captopril reflects more the potency and duration of action of the drug rather than a more serious diverse consequence. In patients with renal insufficiency (serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dl), the more potent, longer-acting ACEI may be required. Advanced CHF, i.e. Class III-IV (NYHA), is a clear indication for the use of ACEI, both for improvement in symptoms and mortality. Indication for ACEI treatment of patients with less severe heart failure awaits the results on ongoing clinical trials.", 
    "391": "Prostaglandins (PG) play an important role in the regulation of the renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. This study was designed to examine PG synthesis in the presence and absence of the ACE inhibitor captopril, PG binding to specific receptors and the ability of PG to stimulate cAMP accumulation in isolated glomeruli. Glomeruli were isolated from rat kidneys by a passive mechanical sieving technique. PG synthesis was determined by RTLC and RIA. The main eicosanoids synthesized by glomeruli were PGF2 alpha, thromboxane (TX) A2 (measured as TXB2), PGI2 (measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and PGE2. Binding experiments were performed with PGE1, PGE2 and the PGI2 analogue iloprost. Scatchard analysis revealed that the specific binding was highest for PGE1, followed by iloprost and PGE2. Adenylate cyclase was preferentially stimulated by PGE1 and PGE2, and to a lesser extent by PGI2, whereas PGF2 alpha had almost no effect. Captopril reduced mainly TXB2 concentrations. Glomerular TXB2 reduction, therefore, seems to be an additional hypotensive effect of captopril medication.", 
    "392": "1. There is a body of circumstantial and direct evidence supporting the existence and functional importance of a tissue based RAS at a variety of sites. 2. The relation between circulatory and tissue based systems is complex. The relative importance of the two in determining haemodynamic effects is unknown. 3. Despite the wide range of ACE inhibitors already available, it remains unclear whether there are genuine differences related to tissue specificity. 4. Pathological states such as chronic cardiac failure need to be explored with regard to the contribution of tissue based ACE activities in generating acute and chronic haemodynamic responses to ACE inhibitors. 5. The role of tissue vs plasma ACE activity may be clarified by study of the relation between drug concentration and haemodynamic effect, provided that the temporal dissociation is examined and linked to circulating and tissue based changes in ACE activity, angiotensin peptides and sympathetic hormones.", 
    "393": "Captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, has been suggested to have additional cardioprotective action because of its ability to act as an antioxidant. The rates of reaction of captopril with several biologically-relevant reactive oxygen species were determined. Captopril reacts slowly, if at all, with superoxide (rate constant less than 10(3) M-1 s-1) or hydrogen peroxide (rate constant less than M-1 s-1). It does not inhibit peroxidation of lipids stimulated by iron ions and ascorbate or by the myoglobin/H2O2 system. Indeed, mixtures of ferric ion and captopril can stimulate lipid peroxidation. Captopril reacts rapidly with hydroxyl radical (rate constant greater than 10(9) M-1 s-1) but might be unlikely to compete with most biological molecules for OH because of the low concentration of captopril that can be achieved in vivo during therapeutic use. Captopril did not significantly inhibit iron ion-dependent generation of hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide. By contrast, captopril is a powerful scavenger of hypochlorous acid: it was able to protect alpha 1-antiproteinase (alpha 1 AP) against inactivation by this species and to prevent formation of chloramines from taurine. We suggest that the antioxidant action of captopril in vivo is likely to be limited, and may be restricted to protection against damage by hypochlorous acid derived from the action of neutrophil myeloperoxidase.", 
    "394": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of an SH-radical in an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor on PGI2 generation, intracellular cGMP, and Ca2+ kinetics in vascular endothelial cells. In the cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the non-SH containing ACE inhibitors, delapril and enalapril, did not result in significant changes in cGMP concentrations. By comparison, captopril significantly (P less than .01) increased cGMP concentrations. Only captopril showed a significant (P less than .01) effect on 45Ca kinetics in cultured human vascular endothelial cells. Captopril also decreased PGI2 generation in vascular endothelial cells. These effects were not seen with delapril or enalapril. The significance of the SH moiety in ACE inhibitors remains controversial. However, these results suggest that there could be differences in the vascular actions of ACE inhibitors related to the presence or absence of SH radical.", 
    "395": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is available for intravenous administration in the form of enalaprilat. Intravenous enalaprilat is indicated for the management of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible. However, there are no reports of intravenous enalaprilat therapy exceeding one week in duration. We report the case of a critically ill, 39-year-old woman who received intravenous enalaprilat for the management of hypertension for a period of 21 days. The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were controlled adequately on a regimen of enalaprilat 1.25 mg iv piggyback q6h without any apparent adverse effects.", 
    "396": "The antihypertensive effects and safety profiles of lisinopril (10 to 40 mg) and atenolol (50 to 100 mg) were compared in a randomized, double-blind, parallel group trial in 144 patients with essential hypertension. After 8 weeks of therapy, seated blood pressure (BP) decreased by 26/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. Lisinopril produced a greater reduction (p less than 0.05) in sitting systolic BP than did atenolol. Standing BP decreased by 25/15 mm Hg with lisinopril and by 19/14 mm Hg with atenolol. No important changes in hematologic and biochemical profiles were seen with either drug. Eleven patients, 7 receiving lisinopril and 4 receiving atenolol, were withdrawn because of adverse experiences; another 3 patients defaulted during treatment, 1 in the lisinopril group and 2 in the atenolol group. Both drugs were well-tolerated and are therefore suitable for first-line therapy in essential hypertension.", 
    "397": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was localized in rat heart by quantitative in vitro autoradiography with 125I-351A as the radioligand. The binding association constant (KA) of the radioligand was measured in membrane-rich fractions of atrium, ventricle, and lung by a radioinhibitor binding assay. A single class of high-affinity binding sites was detected in each tissue, and a significant difference was found between KA values for atria and ventricles with a rank order of atria greater than lungs greater than ventricles. For autoradiography, coronal sections (10 micron) of the frozen heart were incubated with 125I-351A and exposed to x-ray film. The autoradiographs were quantitated by computerized image analysis. The highest density of ACE in the heart was found on valve leaflets (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and tricuspid), which contrasted markedly with very low ACE labeling in the endocardium. The coronary arteries also showed dense labeling of ACE. The right atrium had a moderate density of ACE, which was higher than the left atrium and the ventricles. Both the endothelial and adventitial layers of the aorta and pulmonary artery displayed high densities of ACE, with very low density in the media. ACE was not detected in either the sinoatrial node or atrioventricular node. These results reveal a markedly nonuniform localization of ACE in the rat heart and suggest possible sites for local angiotensin II generation and bradykinin or other peptide metabolism.", 
    "398": "Pulmonary granuloma size, anergy, serum and lung angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels, and responsiveness to captopril therapy were measured in both pulmonary hypersensitivity granuloma (HSG) and foreign body granuloma (FBG) murine models. The kinetic development of the granuloma was similar in both models, peaking at 3 days and resolving by 14 days. The granuloma size of the FBG model was significantly larger than the HSG model at 1 and 3 days. The FBG model further differed from the HSG model in that anergy was observed at 3 days and lung ACE levels were increased at 1, 7, and 14 days. In the HSG model anergy was not observed and lung ACE levels were significantly elevated only at 1 and 7 days. Furthermore, the HSG model was shown to be responsive to captopril therapy whereas the FBG model was not. This study shows that two murine pulmonary granuloma models, although displaying similar growth and resolution kinetics, differ in terms of granuloma size, anergy, lung ACE activity, and responsiveness to captopril therapy, suggesting that the mechanism(s) involved in the inflammatory response of the two models may be different.", 
    "399": "Relapse is a frequent problem for recovered alcoholics since up to 80% do so within 6 months of completing treatment. Although the mechanisms underlying relapse are unknown, several internal and external cues have been associated with it. Desire (or craving) for alcohol is an internal cue which may precipitate relapse and is amenable to physiological and pharmacological studies. Recent studies have indicated that pharmacological manipulations of the serotonergic system can produce variations in craving for alcohol. For example, when challenged with the putative serotonin1 (5-HT1) agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), alcoholics report increases in craving and desire for alcohol (George et al, 1990). In our studies with moderately dependent alcoholics, 5-HT uptake inhibitors (e.g., citalopram) reduced both the craving for and the consumption of alcohol. Studies are underway to identify the mechanism underlying these findings. Other systems may also regulate alcohol craving. However, some agents which allegedly decreased alcohol intake in animals, such as enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, showed no effect on desire for or intake of alcohol in humans. A better understanding of the neural and systemic mechanisms underlying alcohol craving may help us in the prediction and/or prevention of relapse in treated alcoholics.", 
    "400": "The activation or interruption of the responses induced by regulatory peptides are ensured by ectoenzymes, the most important of them belonging to the group of zinc metallopeptidases. Thus angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) forms the hypertensive peptide angiotensin II from its inactive precursor AI. This also the case for aminopeptidase N (APN) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP, CALLA) which together inactivate the endogenous opioid peptides, enkephalins, whereas only NEP is involved in the metabolism of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANP) at the kidney and vascular levels. The pharmacological effects resulting from the inhibition of these enzymatic processes will appear only in tissues where the peptide substrate is tonically or phasically released. This promising approach is expected to avoid, or at least to minimize, the side effects resulting from excessive and ubiquitous stimulation of peptide receptors by exogenously administered agonists or antagonists. The essential amino acids known to be present in the active site of the bacterial endopeptidase thermolysin from crystallographic studies, have also been found in NEP by using a new program of sequence comparison associated with mutagenesis experiments. Several classes of selective inhibitors of NEP, APN and ACE have been rationally designed by taking into account the structural differences in the active site of these peptidases. Thus, the retro-inversion of the amide bond of the NEP inhibitor thiorphan resulted in the elimination of a residual interaction with ACE. Moreover, we have proposed to associate inhibitory potencies towards two peptidases in the same compound. Thus kelatorphan HONH-CO-CH2-CH(CH2 phi)-CONH-CH(CH3)-COOH and other systemically-active mixed NEP/APN inhibitors were shown capable of completely blocking enkephalin metabolism in vivo. This concept has been extended to mixed NEP/ACE inhibitors with compounds such as HS-CH2-CH(CH2 phi)-CONH-CH(CH2R)-COOH where R = CH-(CH3)2 (ES 34) or -OCH2 phi (ES 37). Only mixed inhibitors of NEP and APN are able to produce potent analgesia after intracerebroventricular or systemic administration without the major side effects of morphine (tolerance and dependence). Thiorphan or its prodrugs acetorphan or sinorphan lead to a increase in natriuresis and diuresis by protection of ANP degradation, but without any significant antihypertensive effect. Contrastingly mixed NEP/ACE inhibitors such as ES34 induce decreases in blood pressure higher than those that produced by the association of selective NEP and ACE inhibitors.", 
    "401": "The aim of the study was to define a therapy to be combined with an immunosuppressive drug such as cyclosporin A, in order to partially reduce the nephrotoxic and hepatotoxic effects in the treated rats. Two drugs were considered: enalapril, which is an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, and spironolactone, which is an antagonist of aldosterone. These two drugs interrupt the renin-angiotensinogen-angiotensin chain after this has been activated by cyclosporin A, preventing peripheral vasoconstriction and more specifically the constriction of both glomerular arterioles and hepatic vessels from occurring, thus diminishing the cyclosporin A toxicity in both liver and kidney.", 
    "402": "We had previously reported that sinoaortic denervation induces cardiac ventricular hypertrophy in rats. The objective of the present study was to determine whether this cardiac hypertrophy can be prevented by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) with captopril, 20 mg/kg, administered sc twice daily for 15 days. The left ventricular weight/body weight ratio significantly increased (12%) in sinoaortic denervated (SAD) rats 15 days after surgery when compared with the sham-operated group (SO). Administration of captopril to SAD rats prevented this ventricular hypertrophy and decreased but did not completely abolish their high arterial pressure. No changes in the normal pattern of baroreceptor reflex activity were observed in the captopril-pretreated SAD or SO groups. These data suggest the participation of the angiotensin system in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SAD rats.", 
    "403": "Amlodipine (once daily) and captopril (twice daily) had comparable efficacy and safety in reducing the blood pressure of patients with mild and moderate essential hypertension. Amlodipine administered once daily is an effective and well-tolerated treatment.", 
    "404": "This article summarizes data from studies showing the antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine. Ambulatory monitoring studies have confirmed that once-daily dosing provides 24-h control of blood pressure. Comparative studies have shown amlodipine to have superior antihypertensive efficacy to verapamil and equivalent antihypertensive efficacy to hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol. Studies of amlodipine in combination with other classes of antihypertensive agents show an additive effect with diuretics, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. These properties, together with the value of once-daily dosing, promise to make amlodipine a very useful agent for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "405": "The heart is one of the major target organs that becomes secondarily involved with the unrelenting and progressive vascular disease of essential hypertension. As a result of this increasing afterload that is imposed upon the left ventricle, the ventricular chamber adapts structurally and functionally. Structural changes involve an increase in muscle mass that is achieved through left ventricular hypertrophy (in a manner similar to the arteriolar changes demonstrated by increased thickening). Unless antihypertensive therapy is interdicted in this disease process, left ventricular failure will ensue as the major cardiac hemodynamic consequence. Left ventricular hypertrophy is also associated with a risk that is independent of the pressure overload and hemodynamic risk. Although antihypertensive therapy will reduce from the hemodynamic alterations, only recently have epidemiological findings suggested that the independent risk of LVH may be reduced with pharmacological therapy. There are no data available to indicate just which agents may reduce the risk from LVH; but relatively recent studies seem to indicate that while all agents may reduce LVH with prolonged therapy only certain classes of agents will do so independent of their hemodynamic factors. Some of these agents, however, may impair cardiac function if arterial pressure is increased abruptly following therapeutic reduction of cardiac mass. Other agents may preserve normal function--or even may improve function. Among those classes of antihypertensive agents that reduce cardiac mass at least in part due to nonhemodynamic factors, are the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, the calcium antagonists, and most adrenergic inhibitors. Evidence will be presented demonstrating the hemodynamic/structural dissociation of those pharmacological agents that reduce cardiac mass with short-term treatment in spontaneously hypertensive rats with left ventricular hypertrophy. Although centrally active adrenolytic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and calcium antagonists all reduce cardiac mass, their structural and cardiac functional effects differ greatly. Even within the ACE inhibitor group their effects vary--improving, impairing, or not changing the Frank-Starling relationships following reduction in left ventricular mass. We postulate great variability of cardiac intramyocytic penetrance of the pharmacological agents and their local intracellular effects on mitogenesis of the ventricular myocyte. The implications on cardiac function and therapy have vast potential. Therefore, current investigative areas involving new concepts of molecular biology of the cardiac myocyte may provide great promise to the quest of unraveling some of the newly postulated questions: What is the role of ionized intracellular calcium? Do the local renin-angiotensin systems in the cardiac and vascular myocyte participate in the development and regression of hypertrophy?(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "406": "The effects of long-term treatment of hypertensive patients with alacepril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) on cardiac mass and function were investigated. A total of 12 patients was examined. Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were significantly reduced by treatment with alacepril for 1 year. Left ventricular mass, as estimated by echocardiography, was significantly decreased by alacepril treatment, although electrocardiographic and chest x-ray findings were not significantly altered. Cardiac pump function, which was also assessed by echocardiography, was not changed. These results indicate that long-term treatment of hypertension with alacepril induces regression of cardiac hypertrophy without any change in cardiac contractile function.", 
    "407": "In previous studies concerning the sympathetic outflow during converting enzyme inhibition, no significant changes after chronic treatment could be observed. Therefore, we investigated the effects of the long-acting converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril on the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake of SHR. Ramipril was administered either i.v. or orally to SHR, whereas desipramine or corticosterone were additionally infused to block the neuronal or extraneuronal uptake of catecholamines. As an index of sympathetic outflow, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations were determined during preganglionic stimulation of the spinal cord using HPLC and ELCD. Blood pressure of SHR was measured in a carotid artery and was significantly decreased in the ramipril treated group under resting and stimulating conditions. Ramipril did not influence stimulated sympathetic outflow. However, in acute and chronic experiments ramipril led to an additive effect to desipramine concerning stimulated circulating catecholamines. Similar results could be obtained after blocking the uptake-2 with corticosterone. 3H-NA-uptake into the hearts of SHR was significantly diminished by about 10% after chronic ramipril administration. It is suggested that ramipril is able to decrease the neuronal and extraneuronal uptake of catecholamines by an unspecific effect due to the comparably high lipophilicity. The blood pressure lowering effect of ramipril is not supported by an inhibition of presynaptic noradrenaline release.",

After 3 weeks of treatment, placebo had no effect whereas cilazapril significantly prolonged exercise duration. In 2 of the patients on cilazapril, exercise duration was markedly prolonged from 387 to 534 and 352 to 556 s. The maximal ST segment depression was unaltered. It is suggested that in selected patients with both hypertension and angina pectoris cilazapril may have an antianginal effect. A larger study is now underway.", 
    "409": "Cilazapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with a long half-life, effectively reduced sitting diastolic blood pressure in patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension at dosages of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/day, evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After a four-week placebo run-in period, 235 patients received either cilazapril or placebo for four weeks. At the end of the treatment period, significant decreases from baseline in sitting diastolic blood pressure were seen in all four groups (mean decreases of 3.3 mm Hg with placebo and 6.4, 9.2 and 8.3 mm Hg with 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg cilazapril, respectively). The cilazapril groups had significantly greater blood pressure reductions than did the placebo group (p less than or equal to 0.02). The 5.0 mg cilazapril dose was significantly more effective than the 2.5 mg dose (p less than 0.03). The response rate was notably greater in the cilazapril treatment groups than in the placebo group (placebo, 27.5%; 2.5 mg cilazapril, 42.9%; 5.0 mg cilazapril 62.5%; 10.0 mg cilazapril, 50.0%). Cilazapril was well tolerated at all three dosages.", 
    "410": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fosinoprilat, the diacid of fosinopril sodium, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, were investigated after the oral administration of 10 mg of fosinopril sodium to 6 chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The results from 1 patient are reported separately because of the presence of concomitant liver dysfunction. The mean t1/2, Cmax, tmax, and AUC values for 5 of the CAPD patients were 19.5 h, 202 ng.ml-1, 4.8 h, and 3.19 micrograms.h.ml-1, respectively. Values for 1 CAPD patient with liver dysfunction were t1/2 of 65.4 h, Cmax of 182 ng.ml-1, tmax of 9 h, and AUC of 18.1 micrograms.h.ml-1. Peritoneal clearance of fosinoprilat was negligible, ranging from 0.07 to 0.23 ml.min-1. Serum ACE activity remained significantly suppressed at 24 and 48 h after fosinopril sodium administration with mean decreases from baseline of 94.2% and 70.6%, respectively. ACE activity was suppressed to an even greater degree in the patient with liver dysfunction, remaining 97% inhibited 72 h after drug administration. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased and plasma aldosterone concentrations decreased following drug administration. Mean arterial pressure did not change appreciably throughout the study. Dosage reductions may not be necessary in the majority of dialysis patients.", 
    "411": "The effect of Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) on renal tubular sodium handling (FENa) in the presence of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI), the AII antagonist Saralasin (SAR), noradrenaline (NA) and angiotensin II (AII) infusions was investigated. FENa and increases in FENa produced by ANP were significantly lower with CEI (p less than 0.03 and 0.0001) or SAR (p less than 0.02 and 0.02) against control (Vehicle + ANP). Mean arterial pressures (MAP) were also reduced. Returning MAP to 107 +/- 2 mmHg with NA (+CEI+ANP), did not change FENa (1.22% +/- 0.16 to 1.25% +/- 0.18, p greater than 0.66) whereas without CEI but with ANP (MAP 113 +/- 2 mmHg) FENa was significantly increased by NA (2.34% +/- 0.36, p less than 0.02). With AII+CEI+ANP, MAP was restored to 110 +/- 5 mmHg, and FENa was highly significantly increased (0.99% +/- 0.20 to 3.04% +/- 0.39, p less than 0.0003) in excess of that expected due to pressure effects alone. It is concluded the additional effect of AII on FENa (3.04 versus 1.25% with NA) at equivalent perfusion pressures are due to a separate additive phenomenon of AII and ANP both causing tubular rejection of Na.", 
    "412": "Potentially malignant ventricular arrhythmias are common in chronic heart failure. The aggravation of such arrhythmias has many causes in these patients and cannot be predicted. Therefore, proarrhythmia due to PDE-inhibitors which increase cytosolic calcium levels by specific inhibition of the degradation of cyclo-AMP may be difficult to recognize. A retrospective analysis of 24-h Holter ECG was performed in 31 patients (NYHA classes III and IV) under long-term enoximone therapy. At baseline, 68% of the patients had ventricular couplets and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. After a mean treatment period of 7 months, 10% of the patients showed a significant increase, 16% a significant decrease (greater than 90%) of ventricular couplets and salvos, and an additional 32% of the patients showed a significant decrease (greater than 70%) of single PVCs. The change of the arrhythmia profile was not related to the clinical course in these patients. Furthermore, 24-h Holter recordings were analyzed in a randomized long-term trial with captopril and enoximone that included 20 patients of NYHA class II. Despite comparable baseline findings, a reduction of cardiopulmonary exercise capacity was observed in patients treated with enoximone, but not with captopril. However, the arrhythmia profile was similar in both treatment groups. These findings suggest that, in most patients with advanced chronic heart failure, long-term enoximone therapy is not associated with an important increase of ventricular arrhythmias. According to the 24-h Holter findings of the European Enoximone Data Bank, proarrhythmia can be expected in 12% of all patients. Control of the arrhythmia profile, however, is mandatory, because the incidence of proarrhythmia cannot be predicted in the individual patient.",

PC decreased 60 min after 0.75 mg/kg E by 35% from 25 +/- 6 to 17 +/- 8 (p = 0,01) and 60 min after 1.5 mg/kg E by 47% to 14 +/- 8 (p = 0,001) and was unchanged after 5 h.", 
    "415": "The clinical trial showed that in P with chronic heart failure (NYHA III and IV) the acute increase of Cl and decrease of PC is higher after E than after C. The improvement of hemodynamics lasts longer after i.v. E than i.v.C.", 
    "416": "In 31 patients with essential hypertension (EH) and in 21 healthy subjects, the influence of water immersion (WI) on arterial blood pressure, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide was examined after administration of captopril. In other 15 patients with EH and 25 healthy subjects, the influence of WI without captopril pretreatment on the above mentioned parameters was assessed. Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone concentration did not differ in patients with EH and in healthy subjects. In contrast, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was significantly higher but its response to WI-induced \"central hypervolemia\" significantly less marked in patients with EH than in healthy subjects. Results obtained in this study do not confirm presence of a tight interrelationship between atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system both in patients with EH and in healthy subjects.", 
    "417": "Epidemiologic studies have revealed that in arterial hypertension left ventricular hypertrophy is an important risk factor for cardiac failure. Accordingly antihypertensive therapy should aim at preventing or regressing left ventricular hypertrophy. Reduction of blood pressure does not necessarily induce reversal of left ventricular hypertrophy. Vasodilators like hydralazine and minoxidil, which lead to augmented plasma levels of norepinephrine, were not able to diminish left ventricular hypertrophy. In contrast, a sympatholytic therapy with methyldopa caused a reversal of left ventricular muscle mass. These experimental findings in spontaneously hypertensive rats led to the hypothesis that catecholamines control the onset and progression of myocardial hypertrophy mostly independent of blood pressure. This hypothesis was supported by the experimental findings, that subhypertensive dosages of norepinephrine induce left ventricular hypertrophy and that this hormone promotes alpha-receptor mediated growth of isolated myocytes. Recent studies have revealed that also the renin-angiotension-system has trophic effect on the myocardium. Clinical investigations have documented regression of cardiac hypertrophy due to antihypertensive therapy with sympatholytic drugs, ACE-inhibitors, calcium-channel blockers and beta-receptor blockers. Diuretics failed to decrease left ventricular muscle mass along with blood pressure normalization.", 
    "418": "Models of right ventricular hypertrophy in rats have been created and characterized: Daily injections of triiodothyronine, irradiation of the lung in Brown-Norway rats, chronic myocardial infarction, and pulmonary artery stenosis. A new Millar ultraminature catheter pressure transducer designed for right heart catheterization allowed the measurement of right ventricular function. All models were characterized by an increase in right ventricular systolic pressure, by an elevation in the RNA/DNA ratio in the right ventricle, and by an increase in the right ventricular weight/body weight ratio. Myocytes isolated from the right ventricle 4 weeks after coronary artery ligation had a greater volume and cross sectional area. Similar results were obtained 14 days after pulmonary artery stenosis. In this model, the effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with ramipril (1 mg/kg, daily) was examined. The increase in right ventricular systolic pressure from 35 +/- 2 mm Hg to 61 +/- 4 mm Hg (without ramipril) was not influenced by ramipril (63 +/- 4 mm Hg), neither was the elevation of right ventricular weight. However, the increase in cell volume and cross-sectional area of myocytes isolated from the right ventricle was less pronounced in the ramipril-treated group (+27% compared to +58% in untreated animals). Thus, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition with ramipril altered the hypertrophic response at the cellular level.", 
    "419": "In 1984 we demonstrated in an animal model of chronic congestive heart failure due to rapid right ventricular pacing in chronically instrumented dogs, that the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system by captopril from the onset of pacing has beneficial effects on hemodynamic and neurohumoral mechanisms. In contrast to control animals, dogs on a chronic therapy with the ACE-inhibitor showed no significant increase in peripheral vascular resistance, a reduced decline of cardiac output and no significant increase of mean pulmonary arterial pressure. Chronic ACE-inhibition led to a significant reduction of the secretion of aldosterone, to an attenuation of the activation of the sympathetic activity and to a prevention of inappropriate stimulation of vasopressin secretion. This was associated with a reduction in symptoms and a lack of fluid retention, whereas control animals developed pleural infusions and ascites. Similar beneficial effects have been demonstrated in rats following myocardial infarction during a long-term therapy with captopril on hemodynamic parameters, heart size, and survival. Thus, early inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in heart failure may be an attractive approach for treatment in patients with ventricular dysfunction even before symptoms develop.", 
    "420": "Sleep apnea, which affects 10% of men in the mean age group, is a common illness, and arterial hypertension one of its early symptoms. For the large group of, mainly young, patients with mild to moderate sleep apnea and arterial hypertension it is important to have a drug treatment available which will effectively control blood pressure without exacerbating symptoms of sleep apnea. We studied the effects of antihypertensive agents on blood pressure, sleep and sleep apnea in a randomized double-blind study of 24 patients with a sleep apnea activity of more than 10 apnea phases per hour of sleep and arterial hypertension with diastolic blood pressure values in the sitting position greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg. Mean age was 51 (range: 33-69) years, mean body mass index 31.4 (24.9-40.6) kg/m2. The study protocol envisaged two baseline measurements in the sleep laboratory, after which the medication was administered for 8 days. On the last 2 days of the treatment, polysomnographic leads were once again recorded in the sleep laboratory. The patients received either the beta-blocker metoprolol (1 x 100 mg/day) or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor cilazapril (1 x 2.5 mg/day). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were decreased by both substances as expected. Total sleep time was 358 (233-425) min vs. 332 (255-383) min in the metoprolol group and 368 (295-424) min vs. 341 (265-434) min in the cilazapril group which is statistically not different between the two groups nor between the proportions of non-REM and REM sleep.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "421": "Smooth muscle cell proliferation and formation of extracellular matrix in the intima of muscular arteries after vascular injury can lead to severe intimal hyperplasia and stenosis. Cilazapril reduces intimal hyperplasia induced by balloon catheterization of the rat carotid artery by 80%, and significantly decreases the surface area covered by proliferative lesions. We investigated the effects of angiotensin II (A II) on SMC proliferation in cell culture and A-II induction of selected growth factor or growth-related genes in SMC in culture: PDGF A chain, TGF-beta, thrombospondin, c-myc and c-fos, and compared the influence of cilazapril on these responses to A II. A-II induced SMC proliferation, stimulated mRNAs for c-myc and c-fos after 30 min, and stimulated mRNAs for PDGF A chain, TGF-beta, and thrombospondin somewhat later. The ACE inhibitor did not have detectable independent effects on the A-II induced proliferation or gene expression. Thus, these data support the conclusion that cilazapril suppresses SMC proliferation in vivo through the block of conversion of A I to A II, and that A II has a critical and central role in the control of the proliferative response after balloon catheter-induced vascular injury.", 
    "422": "Hemodynamic and structural changes of the heart and large arterial vessels were studied in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats following 12-week administration of converting enzyme inhibitor (perindopril, 2 mg/kg daily by gavage). In both strains, a significant blood pressure reduction was observed. In normotensive rats, the hemodynamic changes involved significant increase in systemic arterial compliance, whereas slight changes in left ventricular weight and aortic medial thickness were observed. In hypertensive rats, the increase in compliance was relatively small, whereas there was a major reduction in medial thickness. The reduction of the media thickness was much more pronounced than that of the left ventricular hypertrophy. In both strains, the collagen density in the subendocardial layers of the left ventricle was significantly decreased in treated vs untreated groups. The isomyosine profile of the left ventricular muscle was also modified by ACE inhibition with an increase in the V1 form and a decrease in the V3 form. The present results suggest that the cardiac and arterial changes observed following long-term converting enzyme inhibition do not strictly parallel the blood pressure changes in hypertensive rats. Dissociation between cardiac and arterial changes may be observed.", 
    "423": "It has been shown that converting enzyme inhibitors (CEI) attenuate ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy after myocardial infarction. In most studies, CEI treatment was started when ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy were already well under way. Therefore, we studied the effects on ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy, when CEI treatment was started in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Immediately after a sham-operation or myocardial infarction in rats (sham: n = 8; MI: n = 17), treatment with zofenopril, a novel ACE-inhibitor, was started and continued during 42 days (long-term treatment). In a second group of rats, zofenopril was administered only during the first 5 days after myocardial infarction (short-term treatment); these rats were not treated with zofenopril during the remaining period of 37 days (sham: n = 5; MI: n = 13). Untreated rats served as controls (sham: n = 9; MI: n = 24). The results from this study showed that long-term treatment with zofenopril caused a significant reduction of left ventricular cavity volume in rats with moderate-to-large infarctions, which was accompanied by a significant reduction in the ratio of total heart weight to body weight. However, short-term treatment with zofenopril did not significantly reduce ventricular volume or total heart weight. Finally, both long- and short-term treatment resulted in a small, but statistically significant, reduction of septal wall thickness in sham-operated and infarcted rats. We conclude that CEI therapy decreases ventricular dilatation and hypertrophy after myocardial infarction, only when treatment is continued during the chronic phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "424": "Eleven patients with congestive heart failure class II-IV (NYHA) caused by ischemic heart disease were studied before and three months after adding enalapril to their treatment with furosemide. After an infarction the heart dilates gradually, mainly as a result of slippage of myocardial fiber bundles. It is known that the addition of an ACE-inhibitor to the medical treatment unloads the heart and gradually, within a period of 3 months, reduces heart size. Objectives of this study were to demonstrate remodelling by recording diastolic pressure-volume relations before and after treatment. The study addresses the question of whether regression of dilation, induced by the ACE-inhibitor treatment, improves the oxygen supply-demand ratio and, as a result, the contractility of the heart muscle. Treatment resulted in a reduction of vascular resistance (1479 to 1182 dyn.s.cm-5, p less than 0.05) and of the left ventricular end-diastolic (130 to 108 ml per m2 body surface area, p less than 0.05) and end-systolic (102 to 81 ml per m2 body surface area, p less than 0.01) volume index. The slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, measured using vena cava occlusion and beat-to-beat recording of pressure and volume loops, remained unchanged. Indices of oxygen-supply demand ratio such as a drop of ejection fraction during exercise and parameters of active diastolic relaxation also did not change. Addition of an ACE-inhibitor induces regression of ventricular dilation, but no indications were found that it improves the condition of the cardiac muscle.", 
    "425": "Angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in the treatment of heart failure. It is not known whether the beneficial effects of ACE inhibition are only due to a reduction in pre- and afterload or whether ACE inhibition also has direct effects on cardiac remodeling processes after myocardial infarction. In addition, the effects of differential timing of the treatment are not known. The left coronary artery was ligated in rats to induce a myocardial infarction. Control rats received no treatment. Captopril was given via s.c. placed minipumps (500 micrograms/kg.h) in the first 3 weeks or in the third and fourth week after induction of the myocardial infarction. The structural changes of the heart were investigated. Early after ligation the left ventricle was dilated in association with a marked, but transient DNA synthesis in the remaining left ventricle; the amount of collagen also increased. Early captopril treatment blocked this response, while late treatment had no effects. We suggest that the negative effects of early captopril treatment are due to an interference with the normal adaptive responses of the heart to the loss of muscle, probably through interactions at the cellular level.", 
    "426": "Vasodilators have been shown to improve hemodynamics of the failing heart as a short-term effect, and to decrease mortality as a long-term result. We, therefore, studied the effects of vasodilators and inotropic agents on myocardial mechanics and energetics in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II-III. In these patients, who underwent routine heart catheterization, myocardial oxygen consumption was measured using the argon method, and LV pressure and geometry were obtained from LV angiography using a Millar microtipped catheter. All data were analyzed for one single heart beat. The best correlation was found between MVO2/beat and the systolic stress-time integral which considers LV pressure, LV wall thickness, and LV geometry. The relation between MVO2/beat and peak systolic wall stress was less relevant. No correlation was found between MVO2/beat and pressure-volume work, dP/dtmax, and mean velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. The intravenous application of nitroprusside and the ACE-inhibitor benazepril decreased both the systolic stress-time integral and the myocardial oxygen consumption in proportion to each other, indicating unchanged economy of myocardial contraction. In contrast, beta 1-agonists and phosphodiesterase inhibitors increased myocardial oxygen consumption independently of changes in the stress-time integral. In conclusion, vasodilators decrease LV pressure and chamber size and thereby proportionally reduce MVO2/beat. The reduction of energy needed for myocardial contraction may partially explain the long-term effects of the ACE-inhibitors and combinations of vasodilators. Pure inotropic substances, especially beta 1-agonists, increase myocardial oxygen consumption with only minor changes of systolic stress-time integral.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "427": "The effects of cilazapril, isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN), hydrochlorothiazide and placebo on systolic and diastolic cardiac function were studied to evaluate the relative importance of afterload and preload reduction on cardiac function in hypertensive patients. In 86 patients with essential hypertension, radionuclide studies were performed before and after a single oral dose of placebo (18 patients), cilazapril 2.5 mg (35 patients), ISMN 20 mg (18 patients) or hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg (15 patients). The effects on blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, peak filling rate and time to peak filling rate were measured. Placebo had no significant effect. A comparable blood-pressure-lowering effect was achieved with cilazapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Cilazapril improved diastolic function by increasing the normalized peak filling rate from 2.3 +/- 0.7 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 vol/s (p less than 0.05) and reducing the time to PFR from 174.5 +/- 33.6 to 152.4 +/- 30.8 ms (p less than 0.005). Hydrochlorothiazide and ISMN, however, impaired left ventricular diastolic function: hydrochlorothiazide decreased the normalized peak flow rate from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 1.9 +/- 0.6 vol/s (p less than 0.05). ISMN prolonged the time to peak flow rate from 176 +/- 36 to 195 +/- 29 ms and increased the percentage of diastole to peak flow rate from 46 to 53% (p less than 0.05), whereas the normalized peak flow rate was unaltered. In conclusion, predominant afterload reduction by cilazapril improves left ventricular diastolic function in hypertensive patients, while preload reduction by diuretics and nitrates impairs it.", 
    "428": "A double-blind, crossover study was carried out on the antihypertensive effect of 5 mg ramipril. Continuous 24-h blood pressure monitoring was performed on 15 essential hypertensives [mean (+/- SD) blood pressure 155.2 +/- 6.5/101.3 +/- 4.8 mmHg], 24 h prior to treatment and 48 h after having received either antihypertensive therapy or placebo; the patients taking part in the study had not taken any antihypertensive treatment 4 weeks prior to the beginning of the trial. After receiving 5 mg ramipril the mean 24-h blood pressure was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced to 148.3 +/- 5.8/91.5 +/- 5.5 mmHg. After 48 h the blood pressure increased to 153.1 +/- 4.8/96.0 +/- 6.4 mmHg. In the placebo group there was only a slight, non-significant reduction in blood pressure on day 1 (154.3 +/- 6.9/97.3 +/- 5.7 mmHg) and during day 2 the blood pressure increased to 155.4 +/- 5.3/99.5 +/- 5.9 mmHg. The results showed that a once-daily administration of 5 mg ramipril produced a reduction in blood pressure, which lasted 24 h. This simple therapeutic regime offers the advantage of being easy for patients to follow and, therefore, promotes compliance with therapy.", 
    "429": "The antihypertensive efficacy and safety of doxazosin and enalapril were compared in the general practice setting (n = 54). Both agents produced comparable, statistically significant (p less than 0.05) reductions in mean blood pressure with no clinically relevant changes in heart rate. Side effects in the two groups were mild or moderate and disappeared or were tolerated with continued treatment. Doxazosin, in contrast to enalapril, produced a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in the total serum cholesterol concentration, a reduction in the level of triglycerides, and a favorable increase in the high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol ratio. The reduction in calculated coronary heart disease risk produced by doxazosin (-27.58%) was highly significant (p less than 0.0002) and greater than that produced by enalapril (-18.49% p less than 0.02).", 
    "430": "In 33 patients with heart failure (NYHA II-III), the 24-h blood pressure rhythm was examined before and after the titration period of two ACE inhibitors. Blood pressure was measured by the oscillometric method using the blood pressure monitor 90202 from SpaceLabs, Inc. The measurements were taken from 06:00 to 22:00 h every 20 min and from 22:00 to 06:00 h every hour. Patients were randomized to therapy with either captopril (group 1, n = 17) or enalapril (group 2, n = 16). The average daily dosage of captopril was 41 +/- 3 mg given in three divided doses (08:00, 12:00, and 17:00 h). The mean dose of enalapril was 8 +/- 1 mg once daily (08:00 h). Serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, and plasma renin activity were measured before and during therapy with both ACE inhibitors. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure measurements were taken before and on the fifth day of treatment with ACE inhibitors. Both groups were not different with respect to the degree of heart failure, the concomitant medication, and the 24-h profiles of blood pressure and heart rate before initiation of ACE inhibition. The 24-h blood pressure values on day 5 were consistently below the pretreatment values (p less than 0.005) in both groups. Both groups did not differ significantly during ACE inhibition in their 24-h blood pressure and heart rate profiles. In both groups, the mesor of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly by the same degree (by 4.7/5.1 mmg Hg in group 1 and 6.4/4.1 mm Hg in group 2). The systolic/diastolic blood pressure amplitude decreased slightly in both groups. Before treatment, serum sodium, potassium, and creatinine were within the normal range. The increase in potassium (0.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/L) reached statistical significance (p less than 0.01) only in the captopril group, whereas it was not significant in the enalapril group (0.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/L). Serum creatinine was not significantly altered by both ACE inhibitors. No relationship could be found between the changes in serum potassium or creatinine and the mean of the 24-h blood pressure values during ACE inhibition. Captopril and enalapril showed comparable blood pressure profiles and similar effects on renal function at the end of the titration on day 5. It can therefore be concluded that the effects on blood pressure rhythm and renal function are similar with a single daily dose of enalapril compared to captopril given three times daily.", 
    "431": "A new radioimmunoassay (RIA) was developed for the direct measurement of perindoprilate (PT), the active metabolite (diacid) of Perindopril (P), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Antibodies were raised in rabbits against the lysine derivative of PT conjugated to bovine serum albumin. The p-hydroxyphenyl derivative of the lysine analogue was used for preparation of the radioligand by iodination (125I). Cross-reactivities for the glucuronide metabolites of P and PT are low (0.25 and 3.5%, respectively). The theoretical limit of detection is 0.2 nM, the sensitivity attainable with random samples is about 0.5 nM. Within- and between-assay variabilities observed were 4.2-6.7 and 2.8-5.9%, respectively (concentration range 2.1-41.7 nM). Serial dilution of plasma and urine samples showed excellent parallelism (r greater than 0.95; P less than 0.001). Recoveries of PT spiked to urine and plasma samples were 90-120%. The prodrug P can be measured in the same sample (plasma/urine) after chromatographic separation on a Dowex AG 1 x 2 anion-exchange column and quantitative alkaline hydrolysis of the P-containing fraction. It is concluded that the specificity and sensitivity of this assay are amply sufficient for pharmacokinetic studies and in patient monitoring.", 
    "432": "Perioperative circulatory disorders in patients may take the form of a transitory reduction in oxygen transport to the peripheral tissues (pre-shock), manifest circulatory insufficiency in the presence or absence of concomitant heart insufficiency or general congestive heart failure due to the destabilization of an preexisting heart disease. The least problematical stage in this programme of therapy is the treatment of transitory perioperative circulatory insufficiency by manipulation of the oxygen transport system using the following means: comparative volume optimization [according to the central venous pressure (CVP)], positive inotropic support with dobutamine (5-10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), monitoring of the blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen consumption and, in severe cases, insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter. In manifest circulatory insufficiency, sepsis or acute congestive heart failure, the Swan-Ganz catheter seems to be obligatory. In such cases, the positive inotropic therapy is based on catecholamines of medium (dobutamine) or high (epinephrine) positive inotropic efficacy, as a normal pattern and functioning of beta-adrenoceptors can be assumed in such cases if there is no history of cardiac insufficiency. The systemic vascular resistance (SVR) is adjusted to 800-1200 n.s.cm-5 to relieve the working capacity of the heart and to maintain sufficient perfusion pressure by means of constrictors (phenylephrine, norepinephrine) or dilators [nifedipine, nitroglycerin or, if necessary, angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "433": "While the roles of the platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs) in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) continue to be elucidated, these cells, especially in their activated 'synthetic' state, have also been found to express, and proliferate in response to, many of the other families of polypeptide growth factors, such as the fibroblast growth factors. Other stimulators of DNA synthesis, and particularly of SMC hypertrophy, include the vasoconstrictor hormones such as angiotensin II, as well as physical forces, especially stretch or tension. For many of these ligands, multiple receptors have been identified and their means of signal transduction are being characterized rapidly. Regulatory regions of these genes are being identified as are transcription factors. Complex post-transcriptional regulation has also been shown by the findings that some growth factors are phosphorylated, or translocated to the nucleus or the extracellular matrix. Inhibitors have also been identified. These include some prostaglandins, calcium antagonists, agonists that activate guanylate and adenylate cyclases, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, interferon gamma, and heparin. Future studies are likely to show that tyrosine phosphatases and recessive oncogenes also regulate growth. The existence of so many autocrine/paracrine mitogens--together with some experimental data--suggests some redundancy in the system as well as some additive effects. Redundancy may limit the efficacy of antibodies to a single growth factor to block cell proliferation. Their evolutionary conservation implies some unique roles for each growth factor but these have not been apparent from in vitro studies to date. Further insights are apt to come from the increasing recognition that growth factors have other effects--on cell attachment, migration, survival, production of extracellular matrix, thrombosis, vaso-constriction, regulation of cytokine synthesis, and inhibition of growth. Many of these effects may prove to be context-dependent, as with the case of growth inhibition by transforming growth factor-beta. Studies in monolayer cultures may not obtain the same results as studies using cocultures of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, or 3-dimensional matrix cultures, organ cultures, or in the intact animal. In vivo descriptive studies of growth factors expressed in vascular embryogenesis, hypertension, atherosclerosis, acute balloon injury and thrombosis are being supplemented by interventions such as infusions with growth factors, antibodies, and toxin conjugates. These studies, and studies using transgenic mice and homologous recombination, should yield information as to mechanisms and may also suggest new therapies.", 
    "434": "1. Bradykinin (cumulative concentrations of 0.007-0.09 micrograms ml-1) produced a dose-related, but statistically insignificant depression of the isometric contraction of the isolated, spontaneously beating atria of the guinea-pig. The same concentrations of bradykinin did not change the atrial rate, but a tendency to a slight decrease was observed. 2. Enalapril (4.06 or 13.54 mumol l-1), produced a dose-related potentiation of the effect of the highest concentration of bradykinin on the isometric contraction. 3. Captopril (equimolar concentrations) also potentiated the effect of the highest concentration of bradykinin on the isometric contraction. This effect of captopril was not dose-related. 4. Both enalapril and captopril did not change the effect of bradykinin on the heart rate. 5. Bradykinin induced dose-related hypotensive responses in anaesthetized cats (0.03-1.0 microgram/kg b.w., i.v.) with a tendency towards bradycardia. 6. Enalapril (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg b.w., i.v.) significantly potentiated bradykinin-induced hypotension and bradycardia. However, the potentiating effect of enalapril was not dose-dependent. 7. Captopril (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg b.w., i.v.) significantly potentiated bradykinin-induced hypotension and bradycardia. Also, the potentiating effect of captopril was not dose-dependent. 8.

    "435": "Vibrio mimicus, a causative agent of gastroenteritis, has also been reported to attribute to extraintestinal infections. Recently we have purified a metalloprotease produced by the pathogen: however, the role of the protease in V. mimicus infection has not been documented. The V. mimicus protease (VMP) was found to enhance vascular permeability and form edema when injected into the dorsal skin of guinea pig and rat. The permeability enhancement by VMP was observed in a dose-dependent manner in both guinea pig and rat skin. In guinea pig, an inhibitor of the angiotensin-converting enzyme was found to augment the permeability enhancement reaction. The permeability enhancement was significantly blocked by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein reaction. In vitro conversion of plasma prekallikrein to kallikrein by VMP was also noted. In rat skin, the permeability enhancement reaction was not blocked by antihistamine or SBTI. However, the reaction was partially blocked when a mixture of antihistamine and SBTI was administered with VMP. It is apparent from the study that in guinea pig skin, VMP enhances vascular permeability through activation of plasma kallikrein-kinin system which generates bradykinin, whereas in addition to the activation of plasma kallikrein-kinin cascade in the case of rat, stimulation of histamine release from mast cells and other unknown mechanism seem to be also a cause of the permeability enhancement reaction. These results suggest that VMP may play a role in extraintestinal infections with edema caused by the pathogen.", 
    "436": "We performed a prospective time-series study to determine whether computerized reminders to physicians about rising creatinine levels in hospitalized patients receiving nephrotoxic and renally excreted medications led to more rapid adjustment or discontinuation of those medications, and to evaluate physician acceptance of computerized reminders. Laboratory data were followed on 10,076 patients over 13,703 admissions generating 1104 events of rising creatinine levels during treatment with nephrotoxic or renally excreted medications. During the intervention period, medications were adjusted or discontinued an average of 21.1 hours sooner (p less than 0.0001) after such an event occurred when compared with the control period. This effect of the reminders was strongest for patients receiving renally excreted and mildly nephrotoxic medications. Of physicians who responded to a computerized survey, 53% said that the reminders had been helpful in the care of their patients, while 31% felt that the reminders were annoying. Seventy-three percent wished to continue receiving computerized reminders. We conclude that computerized reminders are well-accepted in our hospital and have a strong effect on physician behavior."
