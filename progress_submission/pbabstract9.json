In many cases, this pathological condition is linked to a cluster of metabolic disorders, such as obesity, systemic hypertension and dyslipidaemia, defined as the metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance has been proposed as the key mediator of all of these features and contributes to the associated high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although the molecular mechanisms behind insulin resistance are not completely understood, a negative cross-talk between AngII (angiotensin II) and the insulin signalling pathway has been the focus of great interest in the last decade. Indeed, substantial evidence has shown that anti-hypertensive drugs that block the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) may also act to prevent diabetes. Despite its long history, new components within the RAS continue to be discovered. Among them, Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)] has gained special attention as a counter-regulatory hormone opposing many of the AngII-related deleterious effects. Specifically, we and others have demonstrated that Ang-(1-7) improves the action of insulin and opposes the negative effect that AngII exerts at this level. In the present review, we provide evidence showing that insulin and Ang-(1-7) share a common intracellular signalling pathway. We also address the molecular mechanisms behind the beneficial effects of Ang-(1-7) on AngII-mediated insulin resistance. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic approaches leading to modulation of the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis as a very attractive strategy in the therapy of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes-associated diseases.", 
    "1": "By using model of chronic heart failure (CHF) occurring with induced decompensations, it was shown that inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and beta-adrenoblockers promoted to different degree the correction of hypercatecholaminemia and an increase of survival of rats. The most pronounced effect was characteristic of beta-adrenoblockers atenolol, propranolol, and carvedilol. The lower activity was demonstrated by other adrenoblockers that had no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, as well as captopril. However, positive effect of these drugs on rat survival occurred regardless of their action on the sympathoadrenal system. The ACE inhibitors, particularly hydrophilic lysinopril, to the lesser degree than beta-adrenoblockers, prevented death of animals at the period of the CHF decompensation. The combined use of ACE inhibitors with beta-adrenoblockers, especially with carvedilol, promoted the maximally expressed decrease of the sympathoadrenal activity and an increase of the rat survival, including that at the CHF decompensation.",

Kinetic parameters Km and Vmax of PSMA enzymatic activity for the synthetic substrate (PABG\u03b3G) were determined to be 393\u2009nM and 220\u2009pmol\u2009min(-1) \u2009mg\u2009protein(-1) , respectively. The inhibitor core 1 and fluorescent inhibitor 2 were found to be potent reversible inhibitors (IC50 \u2009=\u200913.2 and 1.6\u2009nM, respectively) of PSMA expressed on the Leo cell line. Fluorescent labeling of Leo cells demonstrated that the fluorescent PSMA inhibitor 2 can be used for the detection of PSMA-positive canine prostate tumor cells. Expression of PSMA on Ace-1 was low and not detectable by flow cytometry.",

The findings show that the small molecule enzyme inhibitors currently being studied for use in diagnosis and therapy of human prostate cancer can also be extended to include canine prostate cancer. Importantly, the findings demonstrate that the potential of the inhibitors for use in diagnosis and therapy can be evaluated in an immunocompetent animal model that naturally develops prostate cancer before use in humans.",

Results are based on relationships in SemMedDB, a database of structured knowledge extracted from all MEDLINE citations (titles and abstracts) using SemRep. The core of our methodology is to construct two potential drug-drug interaction schemas, based on relationships extracted from SemMedDB. In the first schema, Drug1 and Drug2 interact through Drug1's effect on some gene, which in turn affects Drug2. In the second, Drug1 affects Gene1, while Drug2 affects Gene2. Gene1 and Gene2, together, then have an effect on some biological function. After checking each drug pair from the medication lists of each of 22 patients, we found 19 known and 62 unknown drug-drug interactions using both schemas. For example, our results suggest that the interaction of Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor commonly prescribed for hypertension, and the antidepressant sertraline can potentially increase the likelihood and possibly the severity of psoriasis. We also assessed the relationships extracted by SemRep from a linguistic perspective and found that the precision of SemRep was 0.58 for 300 randomly selected sentences from MEDLINE. Our study demonstrates that the use of structured knowledge in the form of relationships from the biomedical literature can support the discovery of potential drug-drug interactions occurring in patient clinical data. Moreover, SemMedDB provides a good knowledge resource for expanding the range of drugs, genes, and biological functions considered as elements in various drug-drug interaction pathways.",

In the absence of MIS, a BTC\u00a0\u2264\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcg/L did not increase the risk for VIT failure. The most important factors associated with a worse outcome were ACE inhibitor medication (OR 5.24, 95% CI 1.83-13.00, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), honeybee venom allergy (OR 5.09, 95% CI 3.17-8.15, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), systemic allergic reaction during VIT (OR 3.07, 95% CI 1.79-5.14, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and a substantial likelihood to suffer from SM (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.37-5.22, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), whereas a double VIT (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27-0.90, P\u00a0=\u00a00.027) and a longer duration of therapy (OR 0.68 per treatment month, 95% CI 0.50-0.93, P\u00a0=\u00a00.017) reduced the failure rate.",

    "30": "There are no reported studies assessing the effects of fixed-dose single-pill combinations (SPCs) of antihypertensive drugs on adherence in real-world patients with hypertension switched from free combinations to the corresponding SPCs. In this retrospective cohort study with a 1-year mirror-image design, a total of 896 patients who had been prescribed with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker and a thiazide-type diuretic within the preceding 12 months of the index (switching) date and the corresponding SPC within 12 months after the index date were included by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance database from January 2001 to December 2007. Adherence was measured by medication possession ratio (MPR). For patients switched to SPCs, the MPR increased significantly from 42% in the preindex period to 69% in the postindex period (relative difference, 75%; 95% confidence interval, 58%-100%; P<0.001). However, for switched patients with high adherence (MPR \u22650.8) in the preindex period, the MPR unexpectedly decreased in the postindex period (absolute difference, -13%; 95% confidence interval, -17% to -9%; P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, MPR difference was inversely related to the preindex MPR, the number of other antihypertensive drugs, and congestive heart failure. In summary, despite of the dramatic effect of SPCs on improving adherence, this strategy is not effective or even worse in patients adequately adhering to their free-combined antihypertensive regimens. The inverse association between adherence improvement and number of concurrent antihypertensive drugs suggests early use of SPCs to curtail the nonadherence gap.", 
    "31": "BPH/2J mice are recognized as a neurogenic model of hypertension primarily based on overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and greater neuronal activity in key autonomic cardiovascular regulatory brain regions. The medial amygdala (MeAm) is a forebrain region that integrates the autonomic response to stress and is the only region found to have greater Fos during the night and daytime in BPH/2J compared with BPN/3J mice. To determine the contribution of the MeAm to hypertension, the effect of neuronal ablation on blood pressure (BP) was assessed in BPH/2J (n=7) and normotensive BPN/3J mice (n=7). Mice were preimplanted with radiotelemetry devices to measure 24-hour BP and cardiovascular responses to stress, before and 1 to 3 weeks after bilateral lesions of the MeAm. Baseline BP was 121\u00b14 mm Hg in BPH/2J and 101\u00b12 mm Hg in BPN/3J mice (Pstrain<0.001). MeAm lesions reduced BP by 11\u00b12 mm Hg in BPH/2J mice (Plesion<0.001) but had no effect in BPN/3J mice. The hypotensive effect of lesions in BPH/2J mice was similar during both day and night, suggesting that the MeAm has tonic effects on BP, but the pressor response to stress was maintained in both strains. Midfrequency BP power was attenuated in both strains (Plesion<0.05) and the depressor responses to pentolinium after enalaprilat pretreatment was attenuated after lesions in BPH/2J mice (Plesion<0.001; n=3). These findings indicate that the MeAm provides a tonic contribution to hypertension in BPH/2J mice, which is independent of its role in stress reactivity or circadian BP influences.",

Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade inhibits tumor growth and has been suggested to improve liver regeneration. We documented the effect of RAS blockade on tumor growth and liver regeneration in a murine model. CRCLM induction followed by 70% PH was performed on 78 CBA mice. Liver regeneration (days 2, 6) and CRCLM tumor load were measured by liver (and tumor) weights, percentage of CRCLM burden and tumor nodule count (days 16, 21). mRNA expression of the RAS components was characterised. Statistical analysis was performed using 2-independent sample T test or Mann-Whitney test (SPSS). Captopril did not impair liver regeneration. By day 21, Captopril decreased tumor burden (percentage of CRCLM in the liver) (48.7 \u00b1 4.7% control, 24.4 \u00b1 6.2 Captopril; p = 0.008), tumor volume (1046.2 \u00b1 200.2 mm(3), 388.3 \u00b1 150.4; p = 0.02), tumor nodule count per image field (181.1 \u00b1 28.5, 68 \u00b1 17.6; p = 0.005) and tumor angiogenesis (71.8 \u00b1 6.4 vessels/mm(2), 43.1 \u00b1 7.6; p = 0.015) compared to controls. Captopril enhanced tumor apoptosis (1 \u00b1 0.2%, 2.5 \u00b1 0.7; p = 0.028). Liver regeneration and tumor development increased liver ACE levels. Blockade of the RAS effectively retarded CRCLM tumor growth at the late stage of tumor development within the regenerating liver without impeding liver regeneration following PH, via anti-angiogenesis and pro-tumor apoptosis.

The follow-up was 12 weeks in patients not receiving antihypertensive therapy (AHT) and 13 weeks in those who had previously received AHT with regard to a washout period. The basis for two treatment regimens was ramipril or losartan. If no target blood pressure (BP) was achieved, amlodipine or HCT was added at week 4 and a third antihypertensive drug (AHD) was used 8 weeks later.", 
    "53": "At the inclusion, clinical BP was 157.64/95.5 mm Hg in 332 (61%) AH patients aged 55.9 +/- 11 years. At week 4 of monotherapy with ramipil 5 mg or losartan 50 mg, BP was reduced to 141.9/87.4 mm Hg. Addition of a second AHD further lowered BP to 131.8/81.9 mm Hg (to 127.6/79.7 at 12 weeks of treatment; p < 0.001). After 4 weeks of treatment with ramipril 5 mg or losartan 50 mg, 35% of the patients achieved target BP. At weeks 8 and 12, double or triple AHT increased the number of patients achieving the target level up to 75 and 94%, respectively. When losartan was used as monotherapy, about one third of the patients achieved target BP; 20 and 22% of the patients required the addition of a second AHD (HCT and amlodipine, respectively). Only 10% of the patients needed to take a combination of three AHDs. Nearly one third of the patients achieved target BP during monotherapy with losartan or ramipril. Double AHT involving ramipril or losartan in combination with the diuretic or amlodipine was used in 18 and 20% and in 22 and 24% of the patients, respectively. 28 and 19% of the patients received triple therapy including ramipril or losartan, amlodipine, and HCT. The most common adverse reactions were dizziness (2.4%), fatigue (1.8%), and coughing (1.2%).", 
    "54": "In the patients with grades 1-2 AH, the treatment regimens using basic therapy with ramipril or losartan proved to be highly effective and allowed target BP to be achieved in 94% of cases.

    "55": "Secoisolariciresionol diglucoside (SDG) is a plant lignan isolated from flaxseed and is phytoestrogen. SDG is a potent and long-acting hypotensive agent. Plant phytoestrogens have inhibitory effects on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). The hypotensive effects of SDG, a phytoestrogen, may be mediated through inhibition of ACE. The objective of this study was to investigate if SDG-induced hypotension is mediated through inhibition of ACE. The Sprague Dawley male rats were anesthetized and trachea was cannulated. The right jugular vein was cannulated to administer the drug and the carotid artery was cannulated to record arterial pressures using PIOEZ-1 miniature model transducer (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Beckman dynograph (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Schiller Park, IL). The effects of angiotensin I (0.2 \u00b5g/kg, intravenously [IV]) in the absence and presence of SDG (10 mg/kg, IV), and SDG alone on systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures were measured before and after 15, 30, and 60 minutes of drug administration. SDG decreased the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure by 37, 47, and 43%, respectively, at 15 minutes and 18.8, 21.2, and 20.3%, respectively, at 60 minutes. Angiotensin I increased the arterial pressure. SDG decreased angiotensin I-induced rise in the systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures by 60, 58, and 51%, respectively, at 15 minutes and 48, 46, and 30%, respectively, at 60 minutes. The data suggest that SDG reduced the angiotensin I-induced rise in the arterial pressures and hence SDG is a potent ACE inhibitor.", 
    "56": "Hypertension is a frequent condition among individuals over 65\u00a0years of age worldwide and is one of the most important risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease. Effective drug treatment of elderly hypertensives is usually associated with a marked reduction in CV morbidity and mortality. Among the different classes of antihypertensive agents, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and ACE-inhibitors are supposed to provide the best efficacy in lowering blood pressure (BP) and protecting target organ damage while featuring a good tolerability profile. However, up to date, few randomized clinical studies have directly compared the activity and safety of ARBs and ACE-inhibitors in elderly hypertensive patients. Aim of this review of published and unpublished pooled data from two recent randomized, double-blind, controlled trials, is to offer a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of the antihypertensive efficacy of the ARB olmesartan medoxomil vs. the ACE-inhibitor ramipril in a large study population including more than 1,400 hypertensive subjects aged 65-89\u00a0years with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. The efficacy of the two drugs was separately evaluated in subgroups of patients classified according to the presence of metabolic syndrome, reduced renal function, CV risk level, gender, class of age, type of arterial hypertension and previous antihypertensive treatments. Olmesartan showed a greater efficacy than ramipril both in terms of clinic BP reduction and rate normalization. Olmesartan appeared significantly superior to ramipril in providing a more homogeneous and long-lasting 24-h BP control and maintaining an effective antihypertensive action in the last 6-h period from drug intake. In subgroups of patients with additional clinical conditions, olmesartan gave comparable, and in some cases greater, BP responses than those achieved with the ACE-inhibitor. The incidence of adverse events was similar for both drugs. Olmesartan may thus represent an effective alternative to ACE-inhibitors among first-line drug treatments for hypertension in older people.",

This study sought to investigate the inhibitory effect of two varieties of ginger (Zingiber officinale) commonly consumed in Nigeria on ACE activity in rats fed a high cholesterol diet. The inhibition of ACE activity of two varieties of ginger (Z. officinale) was investigated in a high cholesterol (2%) diet fed to rats for 3 days. Feeding high cholesterol diets to rats caused a significant (P<.05) increase in the ACE activity. However, there was a significant (P<.05) inhibition of ACE activity as a result of supplementation with the ginger varieties. Rats that were fed 4% white ginger had the greatest inhibitory effect as compared with a control diet. Furthermore, there was a significant (P<.05) increase in the plasma lipid profile with a concomitant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content in rat liver and heart tissues. However, supplementing the diet with red and white ginger (either 2% or 4%) caused a significant (P<.05) decrease in the plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels, and in MDA content in the tissues. Conversely, supplementation caused a significant (P<.05) increase in plasma high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level when compared with the control diet. Nevertheless, rats fed 4% red ginger had the greatest reduction as compared with control diet. In conclusion, both ginger varieties exhibited anti-hypercholesterolemic properties in a high cholesterol diet fed to rats. This activity of the gingers may be attributed to its ACE inhibitory activity. However, white ginger inhibited ACE better in a high cholesterol diet fed to rats than red ginger. Therefore, both gingers could serve as good functional foods/nutraceuticals in the management/treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases.",

Rho may also stimulate angiotensinogen (AGT) expression in preglomerular vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but this has not been established. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the direct interactions between Rho and ANG II in regulating AGT and other renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components and to elucidate the roles of the ROCK/NF-\u03baB axis in the ANG II-induced AGT augmentation in primary cultures of preglomerular VSMCs. We first demonstrated that these preglomerular VSMCs express renin, AGT, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and ANG II type 1 (AT1) receptors. Furthermore, incubation with ANG II (100 pmol/l for 24 h) increased AGT mRNA (1.42 \u00b1 0.03, ratio to control) and protein (1.68 \u00b1 0.05, ratio to control) expression levels, intracellular ANG II levels, and NF-\u03baB activity. In contrast, the ANG II treatment did not alter AT1a and AT1b mRNA levels in the cells. Treatment with H-1152 (ROCK inhibitor, 10 nmol/l) and ROCK1 small interfering (si) RNA suppressed the ANG II-induced AGT augmentation and the upregulation and translocalization of p65 into nuclei. Functional studies showed that ROCK exerted a greater influence on afferent arteriole responses to ANG II in rats subjected to chronic ANG II infusions. These results indicate that ROCK is involved in NF-\u03baB activation and the ROCK/NF-\u03baB axis contributes to ANG II-induced AGT upregulation, leading to intracellular ANG II augmentation.",

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of enalapril on plasma adiponectin and leptin levels in hypertensive individuals. Thirty-seven untreated hypertensive patients were prospectively treated with enalapril for 8 weeks. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after the treatment with enalapril. Plasma adiponectin and leptin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay. We found significant increases in adiponectin levels after enalapril treatment (5.4 \u00b1 3.7 versus 6.0 \u00b1 4.5 \u03bcg/mL, mean \u00b1 S.D., p = 0.04).

Multiple linear regression revealed that baseline leptin is a significant predictor of systolic blood pressure reduction (\u03b2=0.269, p = 0.01) in hypertensive individuals treated with enalapril. While enalapril increases adiponectin levels in hypertensive individuals, baseline leptin levels predict blood pressure reduction in response to this therapy. These findings support the idea of an important relationship between RAAS and adipose tissue in hypertension and suggest that enalapril improves the adipokine profile, possibly allowing beneficial effects to overweight or obese hypertensive individuals.",

However, their effect in spinal surgery has not been explored. Our objective was to determine the effect of RAS inhibitors on postoperative troponin elevation in spinal fusions, and to examine their correlation with hospital stay. We retrospectively analyzed 208 consecutive patients receiving spinal fusions \u2a7e5 levels between 2007-2010 with a mean follow-up of 1.7 years. Inclusion criteria were age \u2a7e18 years, elective fusions for kyphoscoliosis, and semi-elective fusions for tumor or infection. Exclusion criteria were trauma and follow-up <1 year. Descriptives, frequencies, and logistic and linear regression were used to analyze troponin elevation (\u2a7e0.04 ng/mL), peak troponin level, and hospital stay. The results featured 208 patients with a mean body mass index (BMI) 28.5 kg/m(2) who underwent 345 spinal fusions. ACEI/ARB were withheld the day prior to surgery in 121 patients with 11 patients noteworthy for intra-operative electrocardiogram changes, 126 patients with troponin elevation, and 14 MI identified prior to discharge.

In 2007, the rate of prescribing atenolol at inappropriately high doses has declined as compared to 1998, especially in males. Methyldopa overall use has declined in 2007, although it is often prescribed to females. Compared to baseline of 1998 there was a significant upturn in diuretic use. Nonetheless the trend towards prescribing indapamide \u2264 1.5 mg/day and 12.5 mg/day hydrochlorothiazide, at doses least likely to cause SD, was evident in both male and females.

    "113": "To date, physical exercise is the only intervention consistently demonstrated to attenuate age-related declines in physical function. However, variability exists in seniors' responsiveness to training. One potential source of variability is the insertion (I allele) or deletion (D allele) of a 287 bp fragment in intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. This polymorphism is known to influence a variety of physiological adaptions to exercise. However, evidence is inconclusive regarding the influence of this polymorphism on older adults' functional responses to exercise. This study aimed to evaluate the association of ACE I/D genotypes with changes in physical function among Caucasian older adults (n = 283) following 12 mo of either structured, multimodal physical activity or health education. Measures of physical function included usual-paced gait speed and performance on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). After checking Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, we used using linear regression to evaluate the genotype*treatment interaction for each outcome. Covariates included clinic site, body mass index, age, sex, baseline score, comorbidity, and use of angiotensin receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors. Genotype frequencies [II (19.4%), ID (42.4%), DD (38.2%)] were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.05). The genotype*treatment interaction was statistically significant for both gait speed (P = 0.002) and SPPB (P = 0.020). Exercise improved gait speed by 0.06 \u00b1 0.01 m/sec and SPPB score by 0.72 \u00b1 0.16 points among those with at least one D allele (ID/DD carriers), but function was not improved among II carriers.

The clinical profile and course of dilated cardiomyopathy in children have been poorly characterised. A retrospective review of 61 patients (37 female; 24 male) diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy from January, 2005 to June, 2012 at a single institution was performed. The median age at diagnosis was 15 months. Heart failure was present in 83.6% of patients and 44.3% required intensive care. The most prevalent causes were idiopathic (47.5%), viral myocarditis (18.0%) and inherited metabolic diseases (11.5%). In viral myocarditis, Parvovirus B19 was the most common identified agent, in concurrence with the increasing incidence documented recently. Inherited metabolic diseases were responsible for 11.5% of dilated cardiomyopathy cases compared with the 4-6% described in the literature, which reinforces the importance of considering this aetiology in differential diagnosis of paediatric dilated cardiomyopathy. The overall mortality rate was 16.1% and five patients underwent heart transplantation. In our series, age at diagnosis and aetiology were the most important prognosis factors.

The renin inhibitor aliskiren increases cardiac tissue kallikrein and bradykinin levels. In the present study, we investigated the effect of aliskiren on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and the roles of B2 and AT2 receptors in this effect. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with aliskiren (10 mg/kg per day) and valsartan (30 mg/kg per day), alone or in combination, together with the B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (0.5 mg/kg per day) or the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (30 mg/kg per day), for 4 weeks before myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Aliskiren increased cardiac bradykinin levels and attenuated valsartan-induced increases in plasma angiotensin II levels. In vehicle-treated rats, myocardial infarct size (% area at risk, mean\u00b1SEM, n=7-13) was 43\u00b13%. This was reduced to a similar extent by aliskiren, valsartan, and their combination to 24\u00b13%, 25\u00b13%, and 22\u00b12%, respectively. Icatibant reversed the cardioprotective effects of aliskiren and the combination of aliskiren plus valsartan, but not valsartan alone, indicating that valsartan-induced cardioprotection was not mediated by the B2 receptor. PD123319 reversed the cardioprotective effects of aliskiren, valsartan, and the combination of aliskiren plus valsartan. Aliskiren protects the heart from myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury via a B2 receptor- and AT2 receptor-mediated mechanism, whereas cardioprotection by valsartan is mediated via the AT2 receptor. In addition, aliskiren attenuates valsartan-induced increases in angiotensin II levels, thus preventing AT2 receptor-mediated cardioprotection by valsartan.",

Surgical patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease should be evaluated by a neurologist. Cardiac and cerebrovascular testing is critical in identifying patients at high risk for perioperative stroke. The identification and treatment of carotid disease in the context of upcoming surgery has been a source of controversy. Routine carotid revascularization performed with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery for incidentally discovered carotid stenosis is not recommended. Prior to aortic manipulation during CABG, epiaortic ultrasound should be performed to identify aortic atheromatous plaques. If possible, preoperative aspirin, beta blocker, statin, and angiotensin converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy should be continued in the perioperative period. Patients who are prescribed anticoagulation at high risk of thromboembolism should receive bridging anticoagulation during the perioperative period. The identification and prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) is central to stroke prevention. CABG patients should be initiated on beta blockade +/- amiodarone to prevent postoperative AF. Many practitioners have been traditionally nihilistic towards acute perioperative stroke treatment. Given the narrow therapeutic window of treatment options, candidacy is dependent on timely recognition. Intravenous and endovascular thrombolysis/therapies are viable options in selected patients under the guidance and expertise of a neurologist. This article will present the epidemiology of perioperative stroke, the pathophysiology, risk assessment and stratification for common surgeries.

    "143": "Overall, 703 patients between 2003 and 2011 were enrolled in this study, with a mean follow-up time of 45 months. Mean eGFR was 84.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), systolic BP was 124 mmHg, and time-averaged mean arterial pressure was 90.0 mmHg. Median proteinuria at baseline was 1.60 g/d, and time-averaged proteinuria was 0.80 g/d. The mean rate of eGFR decline was -3.12 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year (95% confidence interval, -19.07 to 11.80), and annual end stage kidney failure rate was 2.3%.

    "155": "Correlation between blood pressure (BP) target organ damage, cardiovascular risk, and long-term prognosis is greater for ambulatory monitored (ABPM) than daytime in-clinic measurements. Additionally, consistent evidence of numerous studies substantiates the ABPM-determined asleep BP mean is an independent and stronger predictor of risk and incidence of end-organ injury and cardiovascular events than the awake or 24-h means. Hence, cost-effective control of sleep-time BP is of great clinical relevance. Ingestion time, according to circadian rhythms, of hypertension medications of six different classes and their combinations significantly impacts beneficial and/or adverse effects. For example, because the high-amplitude circadian rhythm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activates during nighttime sleep, bedtime versus morning ingestion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers better controls the asleep than awake BP means, with additional benefit independent of terminal half-life of converting the 24-h BP profile into more normal dipper patterning. Recent findings authenticate therapeutic reduction of sleep-time BP, best achieved when the full daily dose of \u22651 hypertension medications is routinely ingested at bedtime, is the most significant independent predictor of lowered cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk.",

An Arabic translated Morisky 4 item scale assessed the adherence of patients. Deviation in prescribing was determined by chart review. All 70 patients had mean age of 56.6\u00b116 years. Morisky 4 item scale predicted low adherence (n=33; 47.1%) and overall nonadherencerate (n=38; 54.2%) was slightly higher than adherence. Percentage nonadherence versus adherence was high with diuretics (53 vs. 46%) and, digoxin (40 vs. 29%). The adherence percentage of angiotensin receptor blockers (9%) and beta blockers (8%) was low.

Due to its instability under both hydrolytic and oxidative conditions, development of rapid, simple and sensitive methods for its determination in the presence of its possible degradation products is essential. We proposed two simple liquid chromatographic methods associated with ultraviolet detection. The first method is an HPTLC-densitometric one in which separation of IMD from its degradation products was achieved followed by densitometric scanning at 220 nm using silica gel F254 plates and chloroform:ethanol:acetic acid (3:0.5:0.1, v/v/v) as the developing system. The second method was based on RP-HPLC in which the separation was performed using C18 analytical column and isocratic elution system with acetonitrile: 0.15% triethylamine (pH=2.2) (40:60, v/v). The optimum flow rate was 1.5 mL min(-1) and the detection was at 220 nm.

The amplitude of individual blood pressure fluctuation with temperature throughout a year (a 29 degrees centigrade range) was 9.4/7.3 mmHg. Medication with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor benazepril attenuated the blood pressure fluctuation by 2.4/1.3 mmHg each year, though the inverse association of temperature and blood pressure remained. Gender, drinking behavior and body mass index were also found to modify the association between temperature and diastolic blood pressure.

Angiotensin-(1-7), captopril, and DIZE did not cause significant changes in tension before or after desensitization of bradykinin receptors in preparations contracted with U46619. Bradykinin caused concentration-dependent and endothelium-dependent relaxations that were not affected by DIZE but were potentiated to a similar extent by angiotensin-(1-7) and captopril, given alone or in combination. Bradykinin responses potentiated by angiotensin-(1-7) and captopril were not affected by the BK1 antagonist SSR240612 and remained augmented in the presence of either N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride plus indomethacin or TRAM-34 plus UCL-1684. ACE2 was identified in the coronary endothelium by immunofluorescence, but its basal activity was not influenced by DIZE. These results suggest that in coronary arteries, angiotensin-(1-7) and captopril both improves NO bioavailability and enhances endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization to bradykinin solely by ACE1 inhibition.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of pre-injections of losartan (AT1 angiotensin receptor antagonist) into the CeA on 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO injected bilaterally in the same area in rats submitted to water deprivation-partial rehydration (WD-PR) and in rats treated with the diuretic furosemide (FURO) combined with a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (CAP) injected subcutaneously (FURO/CAP). Male Sprague-Dawley rats with stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the CeA were used. In WD-PR rats, bilateral injections of DAMGO (2 nmol in 0.5 \u03bcL) into the CeA induced 0.3 M NaCl and water intake, and pre-treatment with losartan (108 nmol in 0.5 \u03bcL) injected into the CeA reduced 0.3 M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO. In FURO/CAP rats, pre-treatment with losartan (108 nmol in 0.5 \u03bcL) injected into the CeA attenuated the increase in 0.3M NaCl and water intake induced by DAMGO (2 nmol in 0.5 \u03bcL) injected into the same site. The results suggest that the natriorexigenic effect of DAMGO injected into the CeA is facilitated by endogenous angiotensin II acting on AT1 receptors in the CeA, which drives rats to ingest large amounts of hypertonic NaCl.",

More knowledge will contribute to the simple prevention of this type of ADR. As the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly is high, the primary objective of this review is to evaluate the literature on the relationship between drug use and vitamin D status, focusing on medicines commonly used by the elderly. PubMed was searched for human epidemiological and clinical studies published until early 2013, investigating the relationship between vitamin D blood levels and use of drugs from one of the following groups: proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), biguanides, vitamin K antagonists, platelet aggregation inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-II antagonists, statins, benzodiazepines, and antidepressants. A total of 63 publications were identified. Thiazide diuretics, statins, and calcium channel blocking agents were the most frequently studied drug groups. Associations between thiazides and vitamin D were mixed (n = 22), statins had no or positive associations (n = 16) and calcium blockers were not associated or were negatively associated with vitamin D (n = 10). In conclusion, several knowledge gaps exist on the relationship between drug use and vitamin D blood levels. Available data are scarce (particularly for the aged), study characteristics are highly variable, and found associations may be confounded by, amongst other things, the underlying disease. Nonetheless, this review provides a basis for future research on ADRs that contribute to nutrient deficiencies.",

It develops following non proliferative (mild, moderate, or severe) and proliferative stages, the earliest being often asymptomatic and with diabetic macular edema potentially developing at any of these. The prevalence and incidence of DR increase with diabetes duration and worsening of metabolic and blood pressure control. Current approaches to prevent and/or treat DR include optimized control of blood glucose and blood pressure and screening for early identification of high risk, though still asymptomatic retinal lesions. Results from the recent clinical trials suggest a role for blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers) and for fenofibrate in reducing progression and/or inducing regression of mild to moderate non proliferative DR. Intra-vitreal administration of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents was shown to reduce visual loss in more advanced stages of DR, especially in macular edema.",

Diabetes mellitus is associated with complications in the cardiovascular and renal system, and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. Modification of the multifactorial risk factors, in particular dyslipidemia, has been suggested to reduce the rates of diabetes-related complications. Dyslipidemia in diabetes is a condition that includes hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein levels, and increased small and dense low-density lipoprotein particles. This condition is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and mortality in diabetic patients. Current treatment guidelines focus on lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level; multiple trials have confirmed the cardiovascular benefits of treatment with statins. Chronic kidney disease also contributes to dyslipidemia, and dyslipidemia in turn is related to the occurrence and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Different patterns of dyslipidemia are associated with different stages of diabetic nephropathy. Some trials have shown that treatment with statins not only decreased the risk of cardiovascular events, but also delayed the progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, studies using statins as the sole treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients on dialysis have not shown benefits with respect to cardiovascular risk. Diabetic patients with nephropathy have a higher risk of cardiovascular events than those without nephropathy. The degree of albuminuria and the reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate are also correlated with the risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers to reduce albuminuria in diabetic patients has been shown to decrease the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

In the kidney, bradykinin, via stimulation of B2 receptors (B2R), favors natriuresis mostly due to the inhibition of tubular Na reabsorption.

The focus of this review is the physiological relevance and molecular details of the bradykinin signal to ENaC.", 
    "234": "The recent epidemiological GenSalt study demonstrated that genetic variants of the gene encoding B2R show significant associations with the salt sensitivity of blood pressure. Bradykinin was shown to have an inhibitory effect on the distal nephron sodium transport via stimulation of B2 receptor-phospholipase C (B2R-PLC) cascade to decrease ENaC open probability. Genetic ablation of bradykinin receptors in mice led to an augmented ENaC function, particularly during elevated sodium intake, likely contributing to the salt-sensitive hypertensive phenotype. Furthermore, augmentation of bradykinin signaling in the distal nephron was demonstrated to be an important component of the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition.",

Despite reducing tumor burden and increasing lifespan, progressive, irreversible cognitive impairment occurs in >50% of the patients who survive >6 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. The exact mechanism(s) responsible for this radiation-induced brain injury are unknown; however, preclinical studies suggest that radiation modulates the extracellular receptor kinase signaling pathway, which is associated with cognitive impairment in many neurological diseases. In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the extracellular receptor kinase transcriptionally-regulated early response gene, Homer1a, was up-regulated transiently in the hippocampus and down-regulated in the cortex of young adult male Fischer 344 X Brown Norway rats at 48 h after 40 Gy of fractionated whole-brain irradiation. Two months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation, these changes in Homer1a expression correlated with a down-regulation of the hippocampal glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase C\u03b3, and an up-regulation of cortical glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase C\u03b3. Two drugs that prevent radiation-induced cognitive impairment in rats, the angiotensin type-1 receptor blocker, L-158,809, and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, ramipril, reversed the fractionated whole-brain irradiation-induced Homer1a expression at 48 h in the hippocampus and cortex and restored glutamate receptor 1 and protein kinase C\u03b3 to the levels in sham-irradiated controls at 2 months after fractionated whole-brain irradiation. These data indicate that Homer1a is, (1) a brain region specific regulator of radiation-induced brain injury, including cognitive impairment and (2) potentially a druggable target for preventing it.",

The Enalapril Maleate (EM) pulsatile release pellets were prepared using extruding granulation, spheronization and fluid-bed coating technology. The ion-exchange experiment, hydration study and determination of glass transition temperature were conducted to explore the related drug release mechanism. Bioavailability experiment was carried out by administering the pulsatile release pellets to rats compared with marketed rapid release tablets Yisu. An obvious 4h lag time period and rapid drug release was observed from in vitro dissolution profiles. The release mechanism was a combination of both disassociated and undisassociated forms of succinic acid physiochemically interacting with Eudragit RS.

One in every four people in the US has been diagnosed with hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension increases further with age, affecting 75% of people over the age of 70. Hypertension is by far the most common risk factor identified in stroke patients. Hypertension causes pathologic changes in the walls of small (diameter<300 microns) arteries and arterioles usually at short branches of major arteries, which may result in either ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage. Reduction of blood pressure with diuretics, \u03b2-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have all been shown to markedly reduce the incidence of stroke. Hypertensive emergency is defined as a blood pressure greater than 180/120mmHg with end organ dysfunction, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, encephalopathy, or focal neurologic deficits. Hypertensive encephalopathy is believed to be caused by acute failure of cerebrovascular autoregulation.

Metabolites were identified by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS) using electrospray ionization in the positive and negative ion mode. They were characterized by accurate MS and MS/MS spectra and based on their different fragmentation pathways. With human liver microsomes fosinopril was metabolized via hydroxylation, glucuronidation, and hydrolysis to fosinoprilat. As expected the main metabolite was fosinoprilat and it was further hydroxylated and glucuronidated. However, these metabolites were not detected after incubation of fosinoprilat with human liver microsomes, indicating that metabolic reactions occur in sequence and fosinopril is hydrolyzed after glucuronidation or hydroxylation. With the developed UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS method once or twice hydroxylated fosinopril metabolites were detected for the first time and different regioisomers were separated. It was observed that the hydrolysis of fosinopril to fosinoprilat was more efficient with rat than with human liver microsomes, and therefore more hydroxylated fosinoprilat metabolites were detected when rat liver microsomes were used. Glucuronidation of fosinopril was not observed with rat liver microsomes.",

Antiplatelet therapy, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins constitute the foundation of medical therapy. Early noninvasive stress testing is an important risk assessment tool, especially in patients who do not undergo revascularization. Discharge preparation should include a review of medications, referral for exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, activity recommendations, education about lifestyle modification and recognition of cardiac symptoms, and a clear follow-up plan. Because nonadherence to medications is common in patients after a myocardial infarction and is associated with increased mortality risk, modifiable factors associated with medication self-discontinuation should be addressed before discharge.

Thus it was assumed that since systolic function was ''pre- served'' the problem must lie in diastole, although it is not clear by whom or when this assumption was made. Nevertheless, many guidelines followed on how to diagnose ''diastolic'' heart failure backed up by indicators of diastolic dysfunction derived from Doppler echoardiography. Diastolic heart failure is associated with a lower annual mortality rate of approximately 8% as compared to annual mortality of 19% in heart failure with systolic dysfunction, however, morbidity rate can be substantial. Thus, diastolic heart failure is an important clinical disorder mainly seen in the elderly patients with hypertensive heart disease. Early recognition and appropriate therapy of diastolic dysfunction is advisable to prevent further progression to diastolic heart failure and death. There is no specific therapy to improve LV diastolic function directly. Medical therapy of diastolic dysfunction is often empirical and lacks clear-cut pathophysiologic concepts. Nevertheless, there is growing evidence that calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and ARB as well as nitric oxide donors can be beneficial. Treatment of the underlying disease is currently the most important therapeutic approach.",

Of 332 patients who received an ACE inhibitor as inpatients at our institution from 1 January 2010 to 1 July 2012, 20 patients had a doubling of serum creatinine (SCr) within 72 h after initiation or dose uptitration of an ACE inhibitor (AKI group). These cases were matched one to four by age and gender to patients who received an ACE inhibitor but did not have a doubling of SCr (control group). The patients in the AKI group had a significantly greater decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures before their AKI than the control group. Pediatric patients who experience ACE inhibitor-associated AKI have a significantly greater decrease in blood pressure than patients who do not experience ACE inhibitor-associated AKI. The authors suggest that the risk and benefits of ACE inhibitor use be stringently evaluated before initiation of therapy.",

    "329": "Insecticide resistance constitutes a major threat that may undermine current gain in malaria control in most endemic countries. National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) need as much information as possible on the resistance status of malaria vectors and underlying mechanisms in order to implement the most relevant and efficient control strategy. Bioassays, biochemical and molecular analysis were performed on An. gambiae collected in six sentinel sites in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The sites were selected on the basis of their bioclimatic status and agricultural practices. An. gambiae populations across sites showed high levels of resistance to organochloride, pyrethroid and carbamate insecticides. The kdr and ace-1(R) mutations were detected in almost all sentinel sites with mosquitoes on the coastal and cotton growing areas mostly affected by these mutations. At almost all sites, the levels of detoxifying enzymes (mixed-function oxidases (MFOs), non-specific esterases (NSE) and glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs)) in An. gambiae populations were significantly higher than the levels found in the susceptible strain Kisumu. Pre-exposure of mosquitoes to PBO, an inhibitor of MFOs and NSEs, significantly increased mortality rates to pyrethroids and carbamates in mosquitoes but resistance in most cases was not fully synergised by PBO, inferring a residual role of additional mechanisms, including kdr and ace-1 site insensitivity. The large distribution of resistance in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire raises an important question of whether to continue to deploy pyrethroid-based long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and insecticide residual spraying (IRS) towards which resistance continues to rise with no guarantee that the level of resistance would not compromise their efficacy. Innovative strategies that combine insecticide and synergists in LLINs or spatially LLIN and an effective non-pyrethroid insecticide for IRS could be in the short term the best practice for the NMCP to manage insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and other endemic countries facing resistance.",

Urinary incontinence has been associated with worse functional status in patients with heart failure, occurring three times more frequently in patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV symptoms compared with those with milder disease.

This type of drug-disease interaction, in which the treatment for heart failure precipitates incontinence, and removal of medications to relieve incontinence worsens heart failure, can be termed therapeutic competition. The mechanisms by which heart failure medication such as diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and \u03b2-blockers aggravate lower urinary tract symptoms are discussed. Initiation of a prescribing cascade, whereby antimuscarinic agents or \u03b23-agonists are added to treat symptoms of urinary urgency and incontinence, is best avoided.

The present study undertook a more comprehensive analysis of the CSF peptidase that converts Ang-(1-7) to Ang-(1-4) in control and in utero betamethasone-exposed sheep (BMX). Characterization of the Ang-(1-7) peptidase revealed that the thiol agents 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) and p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (PCMB), as well as the metallo-chelators o-phenanthroline and EDTA essentially abolished the enzyme activity. Additional inhibitors for serine, aspartyl, and cysteine proteases, as well as selective inhibitors against the endopeptidases neprilysin, neurolysin, prolyl and thimet oligopeptidases did not attenuate enzymatic activity. Competition studies against the peptidase revealed similar IC50s for Ang-(1-7) (5\u03bcM) and Ang II (3\u03bcM), but lower values for Ala(1)-Ang-(1-7) and Ang-(2-7) of 1.8 and 2.0\u03bcM, respectively.

Lower Ang-(1-7) expression in brain is linked to baroreflex impairment in hypertension and aging, thus, increased activity of an Ang-(1-7) peptidase may contribute to lower CSF Ang-(1-7) levels, elevated blood pressure and impaired reflex function in this model of fetal programming.",

Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes.

All were free of atrial fibrillation and of predisposing diseases like heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and hyperthyroidism at baseline and none received any other antihypertensive medication. We studied risk of atrial fibrillation, and used risk of stroke, influenced by lowering blood pressure rather than renin-angiotensin system blockade per se, as an indicator of the importance of blood pressure lowering per se. Hazard ratios of atrial fibrillation for ACEi and ARB monotherapy were 0.12 (95% CI: 0.10-0.15) and 0.10 (0.07-0.14) compared with \u03b2-blocker, 0.51 (0.44-0.59) and 0.43 (0.32-0.58) compared with diuretic, and 0.97 (0.81-1.16) and 0.78 (0.56-1.08) compared with calcium-antagonist monotherapy.

Ribbonfish backbone protein hydrolysate prepared by acid protease was fractionated into 4 fractions (I, MW < 1 kDa; II, MW = 1 to 5 kDa; III, MW = 5 to 10 kDa; and IV, MW > 10 kDa) through ultrafiltration membranes. Fraction I, showing the highest ACEI activity, was further purified using consecutive chromatographic techniques including gel filtration and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography.

The process evaluation using the NIRS method showed that the variability was due to common causes and delivered predictable results consistently. Cp and Cpk values were, respectively, 2.05 and 1.80. These results revealed a non-centered process in relation to the average target (100% w/w), in the specified range (85-115%). The probability of failure was 21:100 million tablets of captopril. The NIRS in combination with the method of multivariate calibration, partial least squares (PLS) regression, allowed the development of methodology for the uniformity of dosage units evaluation of captopril tablets 25\u2009mg. The statistical process control strategy associated with NIRS method as PAT played a critical role in understanding of the sources and degree of variation and its impact on the process.

We hypothesized that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuates angiotensin II (ANG II)-induced hypertension via restoring neurotransmitters and cytokines. Rats underwent subcutaneous infusions of ANG II or saline and bilateral PVN infusions of ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (ENL, 2.5\u03bcg/h) or vehicle for 4weeks. ANG II infusion resulted in higher mean arterial pressure and cardiac hypertrophy as indicated by increased whole heart weight/body weight ratio, whole heart weight/tibia length ratio, left ventricular weight/tibia length ratio, and mRNA expressions of cardiac atrial natriuretic peptide and beta-myosin heavy chain. These ANG II-infused rats had higher PVN levels of glutamate, norepinephrine, tyrosine hydroxylase, pro-inflammatory cytokines (PICs) and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and lower PVN levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, interleukin (IL)-10 and the 67-kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD67), and higher plasma levels of PICs, norepinephrine and aldosterone, and lower plasma IL-10, and higher renal sympathetic nerve activity. However, PVN treatment with ENL attenuated these changes. PVN microinjection of ANG II induced increases in IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and a decrease in IL-10 in the PVN, and pretreatment with angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R) antagonist losartan attenuated these changes. These findings suggest that ANG II infusion induces an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and an imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the PVN, and PVN inhibition of the RAS restores neurotransmitters and cytokines in the PVN, thereby attenuating ANG II-induced hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy.",

Less selective and especially nonselective beta-adrenoblockers pindolol and propranolol brought up the atherogenic potential of plasma because of HDL levels reduction in mild CHF whereas in case of severe model--due to the trends toward decrease in HDL concentration and toward increase in LDL levels. Lipophilic ACE-inhibitors and beta-adrenoblockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity improved survival in rats with mild CHF to the equal extent. On the contrary in severe CHF beta-adrenoblockers, especially non-selective, had an advantage over ACE inhibitors on the survival effect.",

Newer antihypertensive medications are metabolically neutral or metabolically favorable; therefore, they are looked upon favorably and are chosen as primary medications for the treatment of hypertension. Here we review the literature on the glucose effects of older and newer antihypertensive medications. We also consider what, if any, impact these metabolic effects have on cardiovascular disease outcomes. We show that the diabetogenic effects of thiazide diuretics and beta blockers are small relative to the glucose effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and calcium channel blockers, and that over time, the glucose differences between older and newer medications diminish. Importantly, we show that the diabetogenic effects of older antihypertensive medications do not translate into increased cardiovascular disease risk.",

The present study aimed to identify the local RAS in glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs). Rat GEnCs were stimulated by culture medium containing 30 mmol/l glucose for 12, 24, 48 and 72 h. Angiotensin II (Ang II) concentrations in cell lysates and culture media were examined by ELISA and mRNA levels of angiotensinogen and renin in cell lysates were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R), Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R), renin and angiotensinogen levels in cell lysates were determined by western blot analysis. Localization of intracellular AT1R, AT2R, angiotensinogen and renin was identified by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Consequently, high glucose (HG) increased intracellular and extracellular Ang II levels. Captopril and chymostatin (inhibitor of chymase, an enzyme that converts Ang I to Ang II) were able to antagonize HG\u2011induced Ang II generation. Moreover, HG increased angiotensinogen production in GEnCs and reduced renin mRNA expression without altering renin protein production. However, HG decreased AT1R levels and resulted in AT2R shifting from the nuclear to perinuclear region in GEnCs. In conclusion, HG activated the intracellular RAS in rat GEnCs and the underlying mechanism may involve angiotensin\u2011converting enzyme (ACE) and non\u2011ACE pathways. The effects of HG on GEnCs may also involve the substrate and receptors of Ang II.", 
    "408": "Two hydrolysates were obtained from dried Mastocarpus stellatus using alcalase. The phenolic content was partially removed from one of them. The phenolic-partially-removed hydrolysate (H) was found to be a potent angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. However, the phenolic-containing hydrolysate (Hp) showed a higher Folin-reactive substance content and antioxidant capacity (reducing power and radical scavenging capacity). Hp was therefore selected for the development of antioxidant Mastocarpus carrageenan-based films. F-Hp0 (without the hydrolysate), F-Hp15 (with 15% hydrolysate) and F-Hp30 (with 30% hydrolysate) films were developed. \u03ba/\u03b9-hybrid carrageenan was the main film constituent and hydrolysate addition resulted in an increased sulfated proportion, higher protein content and higher number of hydrogen bonds. Therefore interactions between carrageenan helices, plasticizers and peptides in the film-forming solution were enhanced, especially in F-Hp15, and consequently the water vapour permeability (WVP) of the resulting film decreased. Nevertheless, F-Hp30 considerably improved the transparency, UV/Vis light barrier, water resistance and elongation at break (EAB). The presence of Hp increased both puncture force (F) and puncture elongation (E), but not tensile strength (TS) or Young's modulus (Y). The addition of an increased concentration of hydrolysate to the films led to a considerable increase in the Folin-reactive substance content and the antioxidant activity, especially the radical scavenging capacity.",

The aim of this study was to explore the effect and underlying mechanism of angiotensin II (Ang II) on collagen synthesis in hypoxic human lung fibroblast (HLF) cells. The HLF-1 cell line was used for in vitro studies. Angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) expression levels in human lung fibroblasts were analysed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) after hypoxic treatment. Additionally, the collagen type I (Col-I), AT1R and nuclear factor \u03baappaB (NF-\u03baB) protein expression levels were detected using Western blot analysis, and NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation was measured using immunofluorescence localization analysis. Ang II levels in HLF-1 cells were measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that hypoxia increased Col-I mRNA and protein expression in HLF-1 cells, and this effect could be inhibited by an AT1R or AT2R inhibitor. The levels of NF-\u03baB, RAS components and Ang II production in HLF-1 cells were significantly increased after the hypoxia exposure. Hypoxia or Ang II increased NF-\u03baB-p50 protein expression in HLF-1 cells, and the special effect could be inhibited by telmisartan (TST), an AT1R inhibitor, and partially inhibited by PD123319, an AT2R inhibitor. Importantly, hypoxia-induced NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation could be nearly completely inhibited by an AT1R or AT2R inhibitor. Furthermore pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), a NF-\u03baB blocker, abolished the expression of hypoxia-induced AT1R and Col-I in HLF-1 cells. Our results indicate that Ang II-mediated NF-\u03baB signalling via ATR is involved in hypoxia-induced collagen synthesis in human lung fibroblasts.",

Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists improve survival in patients with chronic heart failure; however, the effects in patients undergoing dialysis remain uncertain. We conducted a multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized trial with 158 patients receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist and undergoing peritoneal dialysis with and without (control group) spironolactone for 2 years. As a primary endpoint, rate of change in left ventricular mass index assessed by echocardiography improved significantly at 6 (P=0.03), 18 (P=0.004), and 24 (P=0.01) months in patients taking spironolactone compared with the control group. Rate of change in left ventricular ejection fraction improved significantly at 24 weeks with spironolactone compared with nontreatment (P=0.02). The benefits of spironolactone were clear in patients with reduced residual renal function. As secondary endpoints, renal Kt/V and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine ratio did not differ significantly between groups during the observation period. No serious adverse effects, such as hyperkalemia, occurred. In this trial, spironolactone prevented cardiac hypertrophy and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, without significant adverse effects. Further studies, including those to determine relative effectiveness in women and men and to evaluate additional secondary endpoints, should confirm these data in a larger cohort.",

Therefore, evidence-based therapies are more and more being used in patients with some degree of renal dysfunction. However, most pivotal randomized clinical trials specifically excluded patients with (severe) renal dysfunction. The benefit of these evidence-based therapies in this high-risk patient group is largely unknown. This paper reviews data from randomized clinical trials in systolic heart failure and the interactions between baseline renal dysfunction and the effect of randomized treatment. It highlights that most evidence-based therapies show consistent outcome benefit in patients with moderate renal insufficiency (stage 3 CKD), whereas there are very scarce data on patients with severe (stage 4 to 5 CKD) renal insufficiency. If any, the outcome benefit might be even greater in stage 3 CKD compared with those with relatively preserved renal function. However, prescription of therapies should be individualized with consideration of possible harm and benefit, especially in those with stage 4 to 5 CKD where limited data are available.", 
    "415": "A new method has been proposed to sensitive detection of captopril based on surface plasmon resonance band of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The stable and well-dispersed AgNPs with strong plasmon resonance signal were synthesized in situ using a simple and rapid procedure by applying ascorbic acid as reducer and sodium dodecyl sulfate as stabilizer, at room temperature. It was found that, the decreasing of AgNPs plasmon absorbance is proportional to the concentration of captopril which allows the spectrophotometric sensing of this compound. The presented method is capable of determining captopril over a range of 0.20-2.75 \u03bcmol L(-1) with a limit of detection 0.07 \u03bcmol L(-1). The relative standard deviation for eight replicate measurements of 1.00 and 2.50 \u03bcmol L(-1) of captopril was 2.37% and 1.02%, respectively. The method was applied to the determination of captopril in pharmaceutical formulations with satisfactory results, which were in agreement with those of the official method.", 
    "416": "Independent component analysis (ICA) was used as a blind source separation method on a Raman image of a pharmaceutical tablet. Calculations were performed without a priori knowledge concerning the formulation. The aim was to extract the pure signals from the initial data set in order to examine the distribution of actives and major excipients within the tablet. As a method based on the decomposition of a matrix of mixtures of several components, the number of independent component to choose is a critical step of the analysis. The ICA_by_blocks method, based on the calculation of several models using an increasing number of independent components on initial matrix blocks, was used. The calculated ICA signals were compared with the pure spectra of the formulation compounds. High correlations between the two active principal ingredient spectra and their corresponding calculated signals were observed giving a good overview of the distributions of these compounds within the tablet. Information from the major excipients (lactose and avicel) was found in several independent components but the ICA approach provides high level of information concerning their distribution within the tablet. However, the results could vary considerably by changing the number of independent components or the preprocessing method. Indeed, it was shown that under-decomposition of the matrix could lead to better signal quality (compared to the pure spectra) but in that case the contributions due to minor components or effects were not correctly identified and extracted. On the contrary, over-decomposition of the original dataset could provide information about low concentration compounds at the expense of some loss of signal interpretability for the other compounds.", 
    "417": "Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system where it metabolizes angiotensin (Ang) II into Ang 1-7. We hypothesize that Ang II suppresses ACE2 by increasing TNF-\u03b1 converting enzyme (TACE) activity and ACE2 cleavage. Ang II infusion (1.5 mg/kg/day) in wild-type mice for 2 weeks resulted in substantial decrease in myocardial ACE2 protein levels and activity with corresponding increase in plasma ACE2 activity, prevented by AT1R blockade. Ang II resulted in AT1R-mediated increase in myocardial TACE expression and activity, and membrane translocation of TACE. Ang II treatment in Huh7 cells exhibited AT1R-dependent metalloproteinase mediated shedding of ACE2 while transfection with siTACE prevented shedding of ACE2; cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of TACE also prevented shedding of ACE2. Reactive oxygen species played a key role since p47(phox)KO mice were resistant to Ang II-induced TACE phosphorylation and activation with preservation of myocardial ACE2 which dampened Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy. In conclusion, Ang II induces ACE2 shedding by promoting TACE activity as a positive feedback mechanism whereby Ang II facilitates the loss of its negative regulator, ACE2. In HF, elevated plasma ACE2 activity likely represents loss of the protective effects of ACE2 in the heart.",

Patients with type I diabetes were excluded from the study. Clinical outcomes such as ventilator-free days, mortality, length of stay in the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU), and reintubations were compared based on the presence of diabetes.

Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation II, ICU specialty, use of vasopressors, and the need for reintubation were predictors of ventilator-free days at day 28.

    "426": "A range of in vitro, experimental and clinical intervention studies have implicated an important role for hyperglycaemia-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Blockade of RAS by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is an effective strategy in treating diabetic kidney diseases. However, few studies demonstrate the mechanism by which hyperglycaemia up-regulates the expression of ACE gene. Our previous studies have identified a novel curcumin analogue, (2E,6E)-2,6-bis(2-(trifluoromethyl)benzylidene)cyclohexanone (C66), which could inhibit the high glucose (HG)-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in mouse macrophages. In this study, we found that the renal protection of C66 in diabetic mice was associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inactivation and ACE/angiotensin II (Ang II) down-regulation. Generally, MAPKs have been considered as a downstream signalling of Ang II and a mediator for Ang II-induced pathophysiological actions. However, using C66 and specific inhibitors as small molecule probes, in vitro experiments demonstrate that the MAPK signalling pathway regulates ACE expression under HG stimulation, which contributes to renal Ang II activation and the development of DN. This study indicates that C66 is a potential candidate of DN therapeutic agents, and more importantly, that reduction in ACE expression by MAPKs inhibition seems to be an alternative strategy for the treatment of DN.", 
    "427": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a serious public health problem with increasing prevalence and novel approaches to renal protection are continuously under investigation. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of melatonin and angiotensin II type 2 receptor agonist compound 21 (C21) to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker olmesartan on animal model of doxorubicin nephrotoxicity. Six groups of 3-month-old male Wistar rats (12 per group) were treated for four weeks. The first group served as a control. The remaining groups were injected with a single dose of doxorubicin (5 mg/kg i.v.) at the same day as administration of either vehicle or captopril (100 mg/kg/day) or olmesartan (10 mg/kg/day) or melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) or C21 (0.3 mg/kg/day) was initiated. After four week treatment, the blood pressure and the level of oxidative stress were enhanced along with reduced glomerular density and increased glomerular size. Captopril, olmesartan and melatonin prevented the doxorubicin-induced increase in systolic blood pressure. All four substances significantly diminished the level of oxidative burden and prevented the reduction of glomerular density and modestly prevented the increase of glomerular size. We conclude that captopril, olmesartan, melatonin and C21 exerted a similar level of renoprotective effects in doxorubicin-induced nephrotoxicity.", 
    "428": "Chronic continuous light exposure leads to melatonin deficiency along with complex neurohumoral activation resulting in hypertension development in rats. The aim of this study was to show, whether continuous light induces fibrotic rebuilding of the aorta and whether the treatment with melatonin or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril can prevent these potential alterations. In a six-week experiment, 3-month-old Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (ten per group): controls, rats exposed to continuous light, exposed to continuous light plus treated with captopril (100 mg/kg/24 h) and exposed to continuous light plus treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg/24 h). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and collagen type I and III in the media of thoracic aorta were measured. Continuous light induced hypertension and fibrotic rebuilding of the aorta in terms of enhancement of collagen I and III concentration in the aortic media. Both captopril and melatonin prevented SBP rise and reduced collagen III concentration in the aorta. However, only melatonin reduced collagen I and the sum of collagen I and III in the aortic tissue. We conclude that in continuous light-induced hypertension, administration of melatonin, along with SBP reduction, decreases collagen I and III concentration in the aorta. It is suggested that antifibrotic effect of melatonin may reduce the stiffness of the aorta and small arteries and beneficially influence the nature of the pulse wave and peripheral vascular resistance.", 
    "429": "Diabetes mellitus results in severe cardiovascular complications, and heart disease and failure remain the major causes of death in patients with diabetes. Given the increasing global tide of obesity and diabetes, the clinical burden of diabetes-induced cardiovascular disease is reaching epidemic proportions. Therefore urgent actions are needed to stem the tide of diabetes which entails new prevention and treatment tools. Clinical and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that AngII (angiotensin II), the major effector peptide of the RAS (renin-angiotensin system), is a critical promoter of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. The role of RAS and AngII has been implicated in the progression of diabetic cardiovascular complications and AT1R (AngII type\u00a01 receptor) blockers and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors have shown clinical benefits. ACE2, the recently discovered homologue of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase which converts AngII into Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)] which, by virtue of its actions on the MasR (Mas receptor), opposes the effects of AngII. In animal models of diabetes, an early increase in ACE2 expression and activity occurs, whereas ACE2 mRNA and protein levels have been found to decrease in older STZ (streptozotocin)-induced diabetic rats. Using the Akita mouse model of Type\u00a01 diabetes, we have recently shown that loss of ACE2 disrupts the balance of the RAS in a diabetic state and leads to AngII/AT1R-dependent systolic dysfunction and impaired vascular function. In the present review, we will discuss the role of the RAS in the pathophysiology and treatment of diabetes and its complications with particular emphasis on potential benefits of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis activation.",

The influence of bradykinin antagonism on ARB-induced changes was the subject of this study. CBF was measured in Sprague-Dawley rats with laser Doppler technique. The blood pressure was lowered by controlled bleeding. Six groups of rats were studied: a control group and five groups given drugs intravenously: an ACE inhibitor (enalaprilat), an ARB (candesartan), a bradykinin-2 receptor antagonist (Hoe 140), a combination of enalaprilat and Hoe 140, and a combination of candesartan and Hoe 140. In the control group, the lower limit of CBF autoregulation was 54\u00b19\u2009mm\u2009Hg (mean\u00b1s.d.), with enalaprilat it was 46\u00b16, with candesartan 39\u00b18, with Hoe 140 53\u00b16, with enalaprilat/Hoe 140 52\u00b16, and with candesartan/Hoe 140 50\u00b17. Both enalaprilat and candesartan lowered the lower limit of autoregulation of CBF significantly. The bradykinin antagonist abolished not only the effect of the ACE inhibitor but surprisingly also the effect of the ARB on the lower limit of CBF autoregulation, the latter suggesting an effect on intravascular bradykinin.",

After 48h of incubation, viability of the PCLS was maintained and gene expression of PDGF-B was increased while TGF-\u03b21 was not changed. Hsp47, \u03b1Sma and Pcol1A1 gene expressions were significantly elevated in PCLS after 48h, which was further increased by PDGF-BB and TGF-\u03b21. The increased gene expression of fibrosis markers was inhibited by all three PDGF-inhibitors, while TGF\u03b2-inhibitors showed marginal effects. The protein expression of collagen 1 was inhibited by imatinib, perindopril, tetrandrine and pirfenidone. In conclusion, the increased gene expression of PDGF-B and the down-regulation of fibrosis markers by PDGF-pathway inhibitors, together with the absence of elevated TGF-\u03b21 gene expression and the limited effect of the TGF\u03b2-pathway inhibitors, indicated the predominance of the PDGF pathway in the early onset of fibrosis in PCLS.

We included in our review eight studies in patients of at least 18 years of age, with a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy, under an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and/or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) as standard treatment. A subset of patients in each study also received a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (MRB) (either spironolactone or eplerenone) in addition to standard treatment. Combined treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker further reduced albuminuria by 23 to 61% compared with standard treatment. Estimated glomerular filtration rate values upon study completion slightly decreased under combined treatment. Blood pressure levels upon study completion were significantly lower with combined treatment in three studies. Hyperkalemia prevalence increased in patients under combined treatment raising dropout rate up to 17%. Therefore, combined treatment by an ACEI/ARB and a MRB may further decrease albuminuria in diabetic nephropathy. This effect may be due to the specific properties of the MRB treatment. Clinicians should regularly check potassium levels because of the increased risk of hyperkalemia. Available evidence should be confirmed by an adequately powered comparative trial of the standard treatment (ACEI or ARB) versus combined treatment by an ACEI/ARB and a MRB.",

CYP4G16 was the most consistently over-expressed gene in resistant mosquitoes compared with two susceptible strains from Unguja and Dar es Salaam. Expression of this P450 is enriched in the abdomen and it is thought to play a role in hydrocarbon synthesis. Microarray and qPCR detected several additional genes putatively involved in this pathway enriched in the Pemba pyrethroid resistant population and we hypothesise that resistance may be, in part, related to alterations in the structure of the mosquito cuticle.

We investigated whether low-concentration lead exposure alters blood pressure and vascular reactivity, focusing on the roles of NO, oxidative stress, cyclooxygenase-derived vasoconstrictor prostanoids, and the local angiotensin-renin system. Aortic rings from 3-month-old Wistar rats were treated daily with lead acetate (first dose 4mg/100g, subsequent doses 0.05mg/100g, im) or vehicle for 30 days. Treatment increased lead blood levels (12\u03bcg/dl), blood pressure, and aortic ring contractile response to phenylephrine (1nM-100mM). Contractile response after L-NAME administration increased in both groups but was higher after lead treatment. Lead effects on Rmax decreased more after apocynin and superoxide dismutase administration compared to control. Indomethacin reduced phenylephrine response more after lead treatment than in controls. The selective COX-2 inhibitor NS398, thromboxane A2/prostaglandin H2 receptor antagonist SQ 29,548, TXA2 synthase inhibitor furegrelate, EP1 receptor antagonist SC 19220, and ACE inhibitor and AT1 receptor antagonist losartan reduced phenylephrine responses only in vessels from lead-treated rats. Basal and stimulated NO release was reduced and local O2(-) liberation increased in the lead-treated group compared to controls. eNOS, iNOS, and AT1 receptor protein expression increased with lead exposure, but COX-2 protein expression decreased. This is the first demonstration that blood Pb(2+) (12\u00b5g/dl) concentrations below the WHO-established values increased systolic blood pressure and vascular phenylephrine reactivity. This effect was associated with reduced NO bioavailability, increased reactive oxygen species production, increased participation of COX-derived contractile prostanoids, and increased renin-angiotensin system activity.",

The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the efficiency and safety of early (within six months post-transplantation) versus late (after six months post-transplantation) initiation of ACE-inhibitors or ARB in RTRs. The study group compromised of 108 RTRs (50 male and 58 female) who received a kidney transplant. Beside other prescribed antihypertensive drugs all of them took and ACE inhibitors or ARB in order to achieve blood pressure control. For this analysis purpose, recipients were stratified into two groups according to the time of ACE inhibitors/ARB initiation into early (within six months post-transplantation) and late (after six months after transplantation) group. For each patient haemoglobin, serum creatinine and potassium levels were analyzed at the beginning of ACE inhibitors/ARB introduction and at the end of the first, third, sixth and twelfth month. In the 54 (50%) of the 108 patients ACE inhibitors/ARB were initiated within six months post-transplantation and in 49 (90.7%) of them within three months (in 29 patients within one month; in 13 within two months; in 7 within 3 months) post-transplantation. In additional 54 (50%) patients ACE inhibitors/ARB were initiated, but after six months post-transplantation. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups related to age or gender and due to the duration of dialysis treatment before the transplantation. Analyzing the haemoglobin, creatinine and potassium serum levels after initiation of therapy with ACE inhibitors/ARB trough observed period we did not found any statistically significant difference in all measured parameters between the two groups of patients and also within the same group of patients. Therefore, according to experience from our Institution early initiation of ACE inhibitors or ARB appears to be safe in carefully selected recipients with relatively good early graft function.",

Some authors have suggested that the DD genotype of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene would be an adverse renal prognosis factor. It may also have different effects on the reduction of proteinuria by ACE inhibitors in patients with proteinuria. Observations on the association between the ACE gene polymorphism and hypertension have been inconsistent, which might be due to ethnic and geographical variations. In this study was to investigated the relationship between ACE gene polymorphism and antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibitors (ramipril) and to evaluate the possible association between I/D polymorphism and hypertension. We recruited 66 hypertensive patients (male 42, female 24) with overt proteinuria (urinary protein excretion over 500 mg/day). Patients were classified into three groups in accordance with ACE genotypes (17 DD; 35 ID; 14 II). They were treated with ramipril and prospectively followed up for one year. Various clinical parameters including age, body mass index (BMI), 24-h urine protein, creatinine, creatinine clearance (Ccr), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) were measured in the pre- and post-treatment periods. The ACE gene insertion/deletion(I/D) polymorphisms in intron 16 were determined by PCR. Results showed that there were no significant differences in the clinical parameters such as age, gender, serum creatinine, Ccr, SBP, DBP, MAP, and daily urinary excretion of protein among three groups (P > 0.05). ID genotype patients were found to have lower BMI (p = 0.031). ACE inhibition significantly reduced proteinuria in all genotype groups (p < 0.05). The percentage reductions of 24-h urinary excretion of protein were significantly different between the genotype groups (p = 0.042) and for DD genotype were significantly greater than in ID (79.2 +/- 28.9% vs 49.2 +/- 64.8%, P = 0.015). The slope of SBP was the main factor related to the slope of the percentage reduction of proteinuria, however, a significant negative correlation coefficient between these parameters was found (rs = -0.382, p = 0.002). We failed to find significant difference in outcomes of treatments with ACE inhibitor between male and female according the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene. D allele in the ACE genotype could be a useful genetic marker with important clinical, therapeutic and prognostic implications in recognizing patients with proteinuria that are at greater risk of renal damage.",

Method. A PubMed search was made for placebo-controlled trials recruiting at least 1,200 high risk patients randomized to either ACEI or ARB, with follow-up of at least 2 years. Meta-analysis was performed using the RevMan 5 program and Mantel-Haenszel analysis was done with a fixed effects model. Results. Ten trials recruiting 77,633 patients were reviewed. All cause mortality was significantly reduced by ACEI (RR 0.89; P = 0.0008), but not by ARB treatment (RR 1.00; P = 0.89). Cardiovascular mortality and nonfatal MI were also reduced in the ACEI trials but not with ARB therapy. Stroke was significantly reduced in the ACEI trials (RR 0.75; P < 0.00001) and more modestly reduced in the ARB trials (RR 0.90; P = 0.01). Conclusion. ACEI treatment reduced stroke, nonfatal MI, cardiovascular and total mortality in high risk patients, while ARB modestly reduced stroke with no effect on nonfatal MI, cardiovascular and total mortality.",

In diabetic nephropathy, excessive activation of the RAAS results in progressive renal damage. RAAS blockade using angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers is the cornerstone of treatment of diabetic renal disease. Alternative RAAS-blockade strategies include renin inhibition and aldosterone blockade. Data from small initial studies of these agents are promising. However, single-agent interventions do not fully block the RAAS and patients treated with these therapies remain at high residual renal risk. Approaches to optimize drug responses include dietary changes and increasing dosages. The theoretically attractive option of combining different RAAS interventions has also been tested in clinical trials but long-term outcomes were disappointing. However, dual RAAS blockade might represent a good therapeutic option for specific patients. A better knowledge of the pathophysiology of the RAAS is crucial to fully understand the mechanisms of action of RAAS blockers and to exploit their renoprotective effects.

Eight weeks following DEN administration, there was a significant rise in immunohistochemical staining of CD31-positive endothelial cells and consequently hepatic microvessel density (MVD) as compared to normal liver. DEN treatment was associated with elevation in hepatic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level as compared to normal controls (P<0.05, 3842\u00b172pg/ml and 2520.8\u00b197pg/ml, respectively). Similarly, increased hepatic expression of hypoxia inducible growth factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) was observed in 100% of the DEN-treated animals compared to 0% in their normal counterparts. Treatment with leflunomide, perindopril or curcumin alone abrogated the DEN-induced increased MVD as well as the elevated expression of VEGF, while only curcumin inhibited HIF-1\u03b1 hepatic expression. Combination of these agents showed further inhibitory action on neovascularization and synergistic attenuation of hepatic VEGF (1954.27\u00b1115pg/ml) when compared to each single agent. Histopathological examination revealed a more beneficial chemopreventive activity in the combination group compared to each monotherapy.

In addition, we have determined the structure of AnCE (an ACE homologue from Drosophila melanogaster) in complex with both isomers. The inhibitor FI (S configuration) can adapt to the active site of ACE catalytic domains and shows key differences in its binding mechanism mostly through the reorientation of the isoxazole phenyl side group at the P\u2081' position compared with FII (R configuration). Differences in binding are also observed between FI and FII in complex with AnCE.

We hypothesized that microinjections of ANG-(1-12) into the CVLM may elicit decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and sympathetic nerve activity. This hypothesis was tested in urethane-anesthetized adult male Wistar rats. Microinjections of ANG-(1-12) into the CVLM elicited decreases in MAP, HR, and greater splanchnic nerve activity (GSNA). ANG-(1-12)-induced responses consisted of initial (first 1-8 min) and delayed (8-24 min) phases. Prior microinjections of losartan, A-779, and captopril into the CVLM blocked initial, delayed, and both phases of ANG-(1-12) responses, respectively. Blockade of GABA receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medullary pressor area (RVLM) attenuated cardiovascular responses elicited by microinjections of ANG-(1-12) into the ipsilateral CVLM. Microinjections of ANG-(1-12) into the CVLM potentiated the reflex decreases and attenuated the reflex increases in GSNA elicited by intravenous injections of phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside, respectively. These results indicate that microinjections of ANG-(1-12) into the CVLM elicit decreases in MAP, HR, and GSNA. Initial and delayed phases of these responses are mediated via ANG II and ANG-(1-7), respectively; the effects of ANG II and ANG-(1-7) are mediated via AT1Rs and Mas receptors, respectively. Captopril blocked both phases of ANG-(1-12) responses, indicating that angiotensin-converting enzyme is important in mediating these responses.

They combine the advantages of the current statistical methods while reducing their restrictive assumptions and generalizing them to realistic scenarios. The proposed methods replace intractable numerical integration of a multi-dimensionally censored MVN posterior distribution with a simplified, sufficiently accurate approximation. It is particularly attractive when outcomes reach a plateau after intervention due to various reasons. Methods are studied via simulation and applied to data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial/Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications study of treatment for type 1 diabetes. Methods proved to be robust to high dimensions, large amounts of censored data, low within-subject correlation, and when subjects receive non-trial intervention to treat the underlying condition only (with high Y), or for treatment in the majority of subjects (with high Y) in combination with prevention for a small fraction of subjects (with normal Y).",

The mean duration of follow-up was 5.8 years. During years 2 to 10 after transplantation, cardiovascular death occurred in 918 patients (cumulative incidence=4.7%) with a functioning graft. The rate of cardiovascular death was similar in patients who received ACEI/ARB therapy or other antihypertensive treatment overall and in subpopulations of patients who were considered by the transplant center to be at an increased cardiovascular risk, had no pretransplant risk factors, were aged 60 years and older, were treated for diabetes at year 1, or had serum creatinine of 130 \u03bcmol/L or higher at year 1. Multivariable Cox regression analysis confirmed that treatment with ACEI/ARB did not confer a beneficial effect beyond that conferred by other antihypertensive treatments on the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular death during years 2 to 10 (hazard ratio=1.1, P=0.24).",

    "629": "The aim of the present study was to observe the effects of spironolactone on urine protein level and kidney function in patients with chronic glomerular disease receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). A total of 221 patients with chronic glomerular disease were divided into spironolactone and control groups. The spironolactone group was treated with spironolactone at a dose of 20 mg/day, in addition to the original treatment regime and doses of ACEIs and/or ARBs. The control group continuously received the original doses of ACEIs and/or ARBs alone. Twenty-four-hour urine protein levels, serum creatinine and potassium, plasma aldosterone (ALD) and blood pressure were monitored at 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 weeks. The estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) were calculated based on the obtained serum creatinine results. Following treatment, the urine protein level in the spironolactone group was notably decreased compared with that prior to the treatment, whereas the urine protein level in the control group did not show a significant difference. No significant differences were observed with regard to the renal function, eGFR, serum potassium, plasma ALD and blood pressure in either group prior to and following treatment. In conclusion, spironolactone administration, when co-administered with ACEIs and/or ARBs, markedly decreases the urine protein levels in patients with chronic glomerular disease. The protective effect of spironolactone on renal function remains to be demonstrated.",

The stress testing of PU-H71 was carried out in accordance with ICH guidelines Q1A (R2) under aqueous, acidic, alkaline, oxidative, thermolytic and photolytic conditions. The separation of PU-H71 from its impurities and degradation products was achieved within 50min on a Mac-Mod ACE 3 C18 column (150mm\u00d74.6mm i.d., 3\u03bcm) with a gradient mobile phase comprising 20-95% acetonitrile in water, with 0.1% trifluroacetic acid in both phases. LC-quadrupole TOF/MS was used to obtain accurate mass data on various components as well as on their fragments for characterization of impurities and degradation products. The proposed HPLC assay method was validated for specificity, linearity (concentration range 0.1-0.3mg/mL, r\u22650.9998), accuracy (recovery 99.7-101.1%), precision (intra-lab RSD\u22641.39%, inter-lab RSD\u22640.91%), sensitivity (LOD 0.08\u03bcg/mL), and ruggedness.

    "631": "Although patients with American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Stage B heart failure, or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVD) are at high risk for developing symptomatic heart failure, few management strategies have been shown to slow disease state progression or improve long-term morbidity and mortality. Of the pharmacologic therapies utilized in patients with symptomatic disease, only angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (and to a lesser extent, angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs) have been shown to improve clinical outcomes among patients with ALVD. Although evidence to support the use of beta blockers in this setting has been primarily derived from retrospective studies or subgroup analyses, they are generally recommended in most patients with ALVD, especially those with ischemic etiology. Statins are associated with improvements in both major adverse cardiovascular events and heart failure events among patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction. Finally, in eligible patients, placement of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) has been associated with reduced mortality rates among those with ALVD due to ischemic cardiomyopathy, and some subgroups may derive benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy or biventricular pacing.", 
    "632": "Heart failure (HF) is an epidemic associated with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting over 5 million people in the United States and 1-2% of the population worldwide. Observational studies have suggested that a healthy lifestyle can reduce HF risk. Although no clinical trials have targeted the prevention of HF as a primary endpoint, many have evaluated outcomes associated with the development of symptomatic disease (i.e., progression to HF, HF hospitalization or death) as secondary endpoints. Blood pressure treatment represents the most effective strategy in preventing heart failure; each 5 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressures reduces the risk of HF development by 24%. Thiazide diuretics appear to be the most efficacious agents in patients with hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers are first line agents for patients with chronic atherosclerosis, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease. Beta blockers appear less effective as single agents and cardioselective agents are preferred. Calcium channel blockers, specifically non-dihydropyridines, should be avoided and alpha blockers should not be used to reduce HF risk.", 
    "633": "This review will outline the management of patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), i.e., those with structural heart disease and previous or current symptoms. Determination of volume status and appropriate diuretic administration is important in heart failure management. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems improves survival and decreases hospitalizations in patients with systolic or reduced ejection fraction HF (HFrEF). Beta blockers and aldosterone antagonists improve ejection fraction. Indications for additional agents including nitrates plus hydralazine, digoxin, statins, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, anticoagulants, and antiarrhythmics will be discussed. Choice of agents, dose-related effects, strategies to minimize adverse effects, and medications to avoid will be presented.",

However, understanding of their long-term impact, including unintended consequences, is limited. The authors assessed the clinical impact of the sequential implementation of 2 such systems to improve the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) in inpatients with heart failure. Compliance with the core measure improved from 91.0% at baseline to 93.6% with the Pharmacy Care (P-Care) Rule and to 96.4% with the Centricity-Blaze (CE-Blaze) Rule. At the same time, prescriptions for ACEIs/ARBs documented in the hospital discharge summary decreased from 83.2% at baseline to 75.8% with the P-Care rule and to 64.1% with the CE-Blaze Rule. The inpatient mortality rate and the 30-day readmission rate did not change significantly. Better documentation of contraindications in the electronic medical record seems to account for the core measure improvement, even as ACEI/ARB therapy has unexpectedly declined.",

A 44% higher incidence of newly diagnosed diabetes was observed in patients randomized to thiazide diuretic compared with ACEI-based treatment. The other predictors of newly diagnosed diabetes were having a higher body mass index, having a higher random blood glucose, and living in a regional location compared to major cities (a geographical classification based on accessibility) at study entry. After completion of ANBP2, compared with those with no diabetes, the preexisting diabetes group experienced higher cardiovascular (hazards ratio (HR) = 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-2.65) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.02-1.92) when adjusted for age, sex, and treatment. A similar pattern was observed after including the post-trial period for cardiovascular (HR = 1.52; 95% CI = 1.20-1.93) and all-cause mortality (HR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.29-1.73).

The present study applied matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) directly or after prefractionation of the milk peptides by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) or OFFGEL fractionation for the comprehensive analysis of the peptide profile of raw milk. The peptide sequences were determined by MALDI-TOF/TOF or nano-ultra-performance liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS. Direct MALDI-TOF-MS analysis led to the assignment of 57 peptides. Prefractionation by both complementary methods led to the assignment of another 191 peptides. Most peptides originate from \u03b1(S1)-casein, followed by \u03b2-casein, and \u03b1(S2)-casein. \u03ba-Casein and whey proteins seem to play only a minor role as peptide precursors. The formation of many, but not all, peptides could be explained by the activity of the endogenous peptidases, plasmin or cathepsin D, B, and G.

    "652": "Rho-family GTPases like RhoA and Rac-1 are potent regulators of cellular signaling that control gene expression, migration and inflammation. Activation of Rho-GTPases has been linked to podocyte dysfunction, a feature of chronic kidney diseases (CKD). We investigated the effect of Rac-1 and Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibition on progressive renal failure in mice and studied the underlying mechanisms in podocytes. SV129 mice were subjected to 5/6-nephrectomy which resulted in arterial hypertension and albuminuria. Subgroups of animals were treated with the Rac-1 inhibitor EHT1846, the ROCK inhibitor SAR407899 and the ACE inhibitor Ramipril. Only Ramipril reduced hypertension. In contrast, all inhibitors markedly attenuated albumin excretion as well as glomerular and tubulo-interstitial damage. The combination of SAR407899 and Ramipril was more effective in preventing albuminuria than Ramipril alone. To study the involved mechanisms, podocytes were cultured from SV129 mice and exposed to static stretch in the Flexcell device. This activated RhoA and Rac-1 and led via TGF\u03b2 to apoptosis and a switch of the cells into a more mesenchymal phenotype, as evident from loss of WT-1 and nephrin and induction of \u03b1-SMA and fibronectin expression. Rac-1 and ROCK inhibition as well as blockade of TGF\u03b2 dramatically attenuated all these responses. This suggests that Rac-1 and RhoA are mediators of podocyte dysfunction in CKD. Inhibition of Rho-GTPases may be a novel approach for the treatment of CKD.", 
    "653": "Diuretics have been recommended as first-line treatment of hypertension and are also valuable in the management of hypervolemia and electrolyte disorders. This review summarizes the key features of the most commonly used diuretics. We then provide an update of clinical trials for diuretics during the past 5 years. Compared to other classes of medications, thiazide diuretics are at least as effective in reducing cardiovascular events (CVEs) in patients with hypertension and are more effective than \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing stroke. Observational cohort data and a network analysis have shown that CVEs are lowered by one-fifth from chlorthalidone when compared to the commonly used thiazide, hydrochlorothiazide. Relative to placebo, chlorthalidone increases life expectancy. In those aged 80 years and older, the diuretic, indapamide, lowers CVEs relative to placebo. The aldosterone antagonist, eplerenone, lowers total mortality in early congestive heart failure. The benefit of eplerenone following acute myocardial infarction (MI) is limited to administration within 3 to 6 days post-MI. Aldosterone antagonists have been shown to lower the incidence of sudden cardiac death and to reduce proteinuria. In the setting of heart failure, long acting loop diuretics azosemide and torasemide are more effective in improving heart failure outcomes than the far more commonly used short acting furosemide. Evening dosing of diuretics appears to lower CVEs relative to morning dosing. In conclusion, diuretics are a diverse class of drugs that remain extremely important in the management of hypertension and hypervolemic states.",

    "673": "There was a 1.8-fold increase in renin-angiotensin inhibitor drug utilization, rising to 207.4 DDDs/1000 inhabitants per day in 2011. This is driven principally by a 19.6-fold increase in ACEI FDCs. There was only limited utilization of ARBs at just 2% of total renin-angiotensin inhibitor drugs in 2011. Reimbursed expenditure increased 2.54-fold due to an appreciable increase in ACEI FDC utilization at approximately twice the cost of ACEIs in recent years. Alongside this, we noted considerable differences in expenditure/DDD for different ACEIs. CONCLUSION & FUTURE PERSPECTIVE: High patient copayments for ARBs appreciably limited their utilization in Serbia, which mirrors the findings from other studies. Potential future measures to enhance prescribing efficiency include reference pricing for ACEIs based on the lowest price of an established ACEI. In addition, reference pricing for FDCs should be based on the reference price of the individual components combined. This builds on recent reforms restricting the reimbursement of FDCs until 3 months after individual components have been prescribed separately.",

Preliminary trials of angiotensin-receptor/neprilysin inhibitors look positive. Whether these or other drugs will alter current recommendations remains to be seen.", 
    "675": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are commonly used for pediatric cardiology patients. However, studies examining their safety for neonates with cardiac disease are scarce. The current study aimed to test the hypothesis that ACEi-mediated nephrotoxicity occurs in neonates and may be underappreciated in this population. A retrospective review of 243 neonates with cardiac disease between 2007 and 2010 was performed. Demographic data, weight, length, captopril and enalapril dosing, serum [K\u207a], serum creatinine, and concomitant medications during ACEi therapy were recorded and analyzed. Body surface area (BSA), creatinine clearance (CrCl), and change in [K\u207a] were calculated. The age range of neonates at ACEi initiation was 15.9-18.1 days. The inclusion criteria was met by 206 neonates: 168 term (82%) and 38 preterm (18%) newborns. Of these neonates, 42% were female, and all the patients had a BSA smaller than 0.33 m\u00b2 (a group known to have relative renal insufficiency). The mean dose of enalapril was 0.08 \u00b1 0.007 mg/kg for the preterm neonates and 0.08 \u00b1 0.003 mg/kg for the term neonates. The mean dose of captopril was 0.07 \u00b1 0.009 mg/kg for the preterm neonates and 0.13 \u00b1 0.019 mg/kg for the term neonates. A significant decrease in CrCl occurred for both the preterm (p < 0.01) and term (p < 0.001) neonates while they were receiving ACEi. However, the two groups did not differ significantly (p = 0.183). Nearly 42% of all the patients showed renal risk, with approximately 30% demonstrating renal failure by modified pRIFLE (pediatric risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage renal disease) criteria. Despite the lack of significantly different CrCl, the premature neonates were more likely to experience ACEi-related renal failure by pRIFLE (55%) than their term counterparts (23%; p < 0.001). Despite its common use for term neonates with cardiac disease, ACEi should be used cautiously and only when indications are clear. These results also raise the question whether ACEi should be used at all for preterm neonates.", 
    "676": "Peritoneal dialysis offers several advantages such as better clearance of intermediate/large molecules and better preservation of renal residual function when compared with hemodialysis. However, dialysis adequacy is one of the subjects of concern of this modality. There are some drugs that are capable of influencing solute transport in the peritoneum, such as acetyle co-enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) medications and calcium channel blockers. Captopril and Verapamil are often mentioned, but their use has shown varying conclusions and initial studies were performed with the intra-peritoneal administration of these drugs and there are only a few studies on the effect of the oral administration of these drugs. This study was undertaken with the aim to evaluate the effects of oral administration of Verapamil and Enalapril among continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The results of this study showed that Verapamil and Enalapril do not have any effects on glucose, creatinine, sodium, potassium and urea clearance (during the 4-h peritoneal equilibration test (PET) test). However, it was shown that Enalapril significantly increased the peritoneal urea Kt/V and caused a meaningful decrease in the diastolic and mean blood pressures. Therefore, we feel that Enalapril may be administered as an anti-hypertensive medication of choice in CAPD patients, which can also result in better dialysis adequacy. However, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed in the future.",

If patient management is conducted without blinding, a difference between groups may be explained by other factors than study treatment. One factor may come from taking concomitant treatments with an efficacy on the studied outcomes.

We wanted to determine if these concomitant treatments were correctly reported in articles of RCTs on type 2 diabetes and if they might have influenced the outcome.",

Herein, the activity of lisinopril-coupled transition metal chelates was tested for both reversible binding and irreversible catalytic inactivation of each domain of sACE-1. C/N domain binding selectivity ratios ranged from 1 to 350, while rates of irreversible catalytic inactivation of the N- and C-domains were found to be significantly greater for the N-domain, suggesting a more optimal orientation of M-chelate-lisinopril complexes within the active site of the N-domain of sACE-1. Finally, the combined effect of binding selectivity and inactivation selectivity was assessed for each catalyst (double-filter selectivity factors), and several catalysts were found to cause domain-selective catalytic inactivation. The results of this study demonstrate the ability to optimize the target selectivity of catalytic metallopeptides through both binding and catalytic factors (double-filter effect).",

Rates of CV event (3.1% vs 3.5%), bleeding (2.9% vs 2.8%) and mortality (0.9% vs 1.3%) at 1 year were similar between the optimal and non-optimal cohorts, respectively.

An evaluation was done on the effect of Alcalase hydrolysis of defatted Jatropha curcas kernel meal on ACE inhibitory activity in the resulting hydrolysate and its purified fractions. Alcalase exhibited broad specificity and produced a protein hydrolysate with a 21.35% degree of hydrolysis and 34.87% ACE inhibition. Ultrafiltration of the hydrolysate produced peptide fractions with increased biological activity (24.46-61.41%). Hydrophobic residues contributed substantially to the peptides' inhibitory potency. The 5-10 and <1 kDa fractions were selected for further fractionation by gel filtration chromatography. ACE inhibitory activity (%) ranged from 22.66 to 45.96% with the 5-10\u2009kDa ultrafiltered fraction and from 36.91 to 55.83% with the <1\u2009kDa ultrafiltered fraction. The highest ACE inhibitory activity was observed in F2 (IC\u2085\u2080 = 6.7 \u03bcg/mL) from the 5-10\u2009kDa fraction and F1 (IC\u2085\u2080 = 4.78 \u03bcg/mL) from the <1\u2009kDa fraction. ACE inhibitory fractions from Jatropha kernel have potential applications in alternative hypertension therapies, adding a new application for the Jatropha plant protein fraction and improving the financial viability and sustainability of a Jatropha-based biodiesel industry.", 
    "691": "Dyspnea is the predominant symptom for patients with acute heart failure and initial treatment is largely directed towards the alleviation of this. Contrary to conventional belief, not all patients present with fluid overload and the approach to management is rapidly evolving from a solitary focus on diuresis to one that more accurately reflects the complex interplay of underlying cardiac dysfunction and acute precipitant. Effective treatment thus requires an understanding of divergent patient profiles and an appreciation of various therapeutic options for targeted patient stabilization. The key principle within this paradigm is directed management that aims to diminish the work of breathing through situation appropriate ventillatory support, volume reduction and hemodynamic improvement. With such an approach, clinicians can more efficiently address respiratory discomfort while reducing the likelihood of avoidable harm.",

    "693": "English NHS prescribing data for ACE-I/ARA prescriptions were matched at the level of the general practice to numbers of hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of AKI. Numbers of prescriptions were weighted for the demographic characteristics of general practices by expressing prescribing as rates where the denominator is Age, Sex, and Temporary Resident Originated Prescribing Units (ASTRO-PUs). We performed a mixed-effect Poisson regression to model the number of admissions for AKI occurring in each practice for each of 4 years from 1/4/2007. From 2007/8-2010/11, crude AKI admission rates increased from 0.38 to 0.57 per 1000 patients (51.6% increase), and national annual ACE-I/ARA prescribing rates increased by 0.032 from 0.202 to 0.234 (15.8% increase). There was strong evidence (p<0.001) that increases in practice-level prescribing of ACE-I/ARA over the study period were associated with an increase in AKI admission rates. The increase in prescribing seen in a typical practice corresponded to an increase in admissions of approximately 5.1% (rate ratio\u200a=\u200a1.051 for a 0.03 per ASTRO-PU increase in annual prescribing rate, 95%CI 1.047-1.055). Using the regression model we predict that 1,636 (95%CI 1,540-1,780) AKI admissions would have been avoided if prescribing rates were at the 2007/8 level, equivalent to 14.8% of the total increase in AKI admissions.", 
    "694": "In this ecological analysis, up to 15% of the increase in AKI admissions in England over a 4-year time period is potentially attributable to increased prescribing of ACE-I and ARAs.

    "695": "Inhibition of angiogenesis represents one major strategy of cancer chemotherapy. In the present investigation, we investigated the synergism of artesunate and captopril to inhibit angiogenesis. Artesunate is an antimalarial derivative of artemisinin from the Chinese medicinal plant, Artemisia annua L., which also reveals profound anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Captopril is an angiotensin I-converting (ACE) inhibitor, which is well established in Western academic medicine. Both compounds inhibited migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro. The combination of both drugs resulted in synergistically inhibited migration. Whereas artesunate inhibited HUVEC growth in the XTT assay, captopril did not, indicating independent modes of action. We established a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay of quail embryos (Coturnix coturnix L.) and a computer-based evaluation routine for quantitative studies on vascularization processes in vivo. Artesunate and captopril inhibited blood vessel formation and growth. For the first time, we demonstrated that both drugs revealed synergistic effects when combined. These results may also have clinical impact, since cardiovascular diseases and cancer frequently occur together in older cancer patients. Therefore, comorbid patients may take advantage, if they take captopril to treat cardiovascular symptoms and artesunate to treat cancer.",

    "699": "Previous hypertension studies have shown that low levels of vitamin D are linked to elevated renin-angiotensin system. The heat shock protein 70 regulates signaling pathways for cellular oxidative stress responses. Hsp70 has been shown to protect against angiotensin II-induced hypertension and exert a cytoprotective effect. Here, we wanted to evaluate whether the vitamin D receptor (VDR) associated with Hsp70/AT1 expression may be involved in the mechanism by which paricalcitol provides renal protection in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). One-month-old female SHRs were treated for 4 months with vehicle, paricalcitol, enalapril, or a combination of both paricalcitol and enalapril. The following were determined: blood pressure; biochemical parameters; fibrosis; apoptosis; mitochondrial morphology; and VDR, AT1 receptor, and Hsp70 expression in the renal cortex. Blood pressure was markedly reduced by enalapril or the combination but not by paricalcitol alone. However, VDR activation, enalapril or combination, prevented fibrosis, the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells, mitochondrial damage, and NADPH oxidase activity in SHRs. Additionally, high AT1 receptor expression, like low Hsp70 expression (immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence studies), was reversed in the renal cortices of paricalcitol- and/or enalapril-treated animals (SHRs), and these changes were most marked in the combination therapy group. Finally, all of the recovery parameters were consistent with an improvement in VDR expression. Data suggest that Hsp70/AT1 modulated by VDR is involved in the mechanism by which paricalcitol provides renal protection in SHRs. We propose that low AT1 expression through VDR induction could be a consequence of the heat shock response Hsp70-mediated cell protection.", 
    "700": "In this study, 22 phenolic compounds were investigated to inhibit the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Tannic acid showed the highest activity (IC50 = 230 \u03bcM). The IC50 values obtained for phenolic acids and flavonoids ranged between 0.41 and 9.3 mM. QSAR analysis confirmed that the numbers of hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring play an important role for activity of phenolic compounds and that substitution of hydroxyl groups by methoxy groups decreased activity. Docking studies indicated that phenolic acids and flavonoids inhibit ACE via interaction with the zinc ion and this interaction is stabilized by other interactions with amino acids in the active site. Other compounds, such as resveratrol and pyrogallol, may inhibit ACE via interactions with amino acids at the active site, thereby blocking the catalytic activity of ACE. These structure-function relationships are useful for designing new ACE inhibitors and potential blood-pressure-lowering compounds based on phenolic compounds.", 
    "701": "Antihypertensive treatment can improve tissue Doppler indices of left ventricular diastolic function in the short term, but little is known about the longer-term effect of different antihypertensive treatments on progression of left ventricular diastolic function and left ventricular hypertrophy. We hypothesized that long-term treatment of hypertension will lead to improvements in left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic function. We collected detailed cardiovascular phenotypic data on 1006 participants from a substudy of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial. Patients randomized to either an amlodipine\u00b1perindopril-based or an atenolol\u00b1bendroflumethiazide-based regimen underwent conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography at time of control of blood pressure after randomization (\u22481.5 years; phase 1) and after a further 2 years of antihypertensive treatment (phase 2). There were no prerandomization data. Five hundred thirty-six patients had complete data collection at both phases. Left ventricular mass index regressed from phase 1 to 2 with no significant difference between treatment groups (amlodipine: 119.5-116.8; atenolol: 122.9-117.5; P<0.001 for both). Conversely, tissue Doppler diastolic indices did not change in the amlodipine\u00b1perindopril-based regimen (E/e', 7.5-7.6 cm/s; P=not significant), but deteriorated in the atenolol\u00b1bendroflumethiazide-based regimen (E/e', 8.0-8.5 cm/s; P<0.01). Despite regression of left ventricular hypertrophy, there was no associated improvement in diastolic function. In fact, long-term treatment with atenolol\u00b1bendroflumethiazide resulted in a progressive deterioration in E/e'. This may be a factor contributing to the previously described worse clinical outcome in patients treated with atenolol\u00b1bendroflumethiazide compared with amlodipine\u00b1perindopril.",

It was performed a cross-sectional study, between January and July 2009, at the homes of 437 users of 12 health centers in Fortaleza-CE. We administered a survey about blood glucose, body mass index and medication use. Approximately 99% of study subjects with altered glucose classified as not using daily calcium (p = 0.04). Among those with normal blood glucose levels classified as around 93% did not use daily antidepressants / anxiolytics (p = 0.02). Among those with DM 2 normal body mass index, 45.5% were using daily anti-hypertensive ACE-inhibitor class (p = 0.03).

    "703": "The treatment of essential hypertension is based essentially on the prescription of four major classes of antihypertensive drugs, i.e. blockers of the renin--angiotensin system, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers. In recent years, very few new drug therapies of hypertension have become available. Therefore, it is crucial for physicians to optimize their antihypertensive therapies with the drugs available on the market. In each of the classes of antihypertensive drugs, questions have recently been raised: are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors superior to angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB)? Is it possible to reduce the incidence of peripheral oedema with calcium antagonists? Is hydrochlorothiazide really the good diuretic to use in combination therapies? The purpose of this review is to discuss these various questions in the light of the most recent clinical studies and meta-analyses. These latter suggest that ACE inhibitors and ARB are equivalent except for a better tolerability profile of ARB. Third generation calcium channel blockers enable to reduce the incidence of peripheral oedema and chlorthalidone is certainly more effective than hydrochlorothiazide in preventing cardiovascular events in hypertension. At last, studies suggest that drug adherence and long-term persistence under therapy is one of the major issues in the actual management of essential hypertension.",

Therefore, we hypothesized that angiotensin II is also involved in photoaging of skin. In this study, we examined the effect of enalapril maleate, an ACE inhibitor, on recovery of wrinkled skin of hairless mice exposed to long-term UVB irradiation. Immunohistochemical observation revealed that expression of ACE, angiotensin II, and angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors in the skin was increased after UVB irradiation (3 times/week at increasing intensities for 8 weeks). Administration of enalapril maleate (5 times/week for 6 weeks, starting 1 week after 10-week irradiation) accelerated recovery from UVB-induced wrinkles, epidermal hyperplasia and epidermal barrier dysfunction, as compared with the vehicle control. Our results indicate that ACE and angiotensin II activity are involved in skin photoaging, and suggest that ACE inhibitor such as enalapril maleate may have potential for improvement of photoaged skin.",

Continuous ECG (cECG) monitoring is an effective tool for assessing the frequency and duration of silent ischemic episodes for patients with CAD and for risk stratifying asymptomatic patients or those after an acute coronary syndrome by identifying those at increased risk for future cardiovascular events or death. cECG also allows monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy in patients with CAD. Treatment strategies targeted toward the elimination of silent ischemia have shown that revascularization was better than medical therapy in eliminating silent ischemia, but large scale, prospective studies targeting silent ischemia as a treatment endpoint are still lacking.

They are thiazide like diuretics or indapamide, calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers, and \u03b2-adrenergic blockers (ARB). Response was superior in African ancestry patients on a thiazide like diuretic or indapamide and CCB, while the response to \u03b2-adrenergic blockers and ACEI are attenuated. Available data are very limited but self-defined ancestry seems to be the best predictor of individual responses to antihypertensive drugs. Knowledge of the factors like economic and social consideration affect the lower rate of detection, treatment and control of hypertension in the African ancestry population of the USA. For regions in which health care resources are particularly scarce, investment in population-based primary prevention strategies may yield the largest benefit.",

SEC chromatograms and BIOPEP analysis of these peptides revealed that the peptide sequence of the hexapeptide, AHEPVK, was stable throughout gastrointestinal digestion. The pentapeptide, GPSMR, was hydrolysed after digestion and it was predicted to release a dipeptide ACE inhibitor, GP, from its precursor. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of AHEPVK showed that this potent and stable ACE inhibitor has a competitive inhibitory effect against ACE.",

Several drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral antidiabetics, have been reported to induce angioedema. The aim of this prospective observational study conducted in a setting of routine emergency care was to evaluate the incidence and extent of drug-induced non-histaminergic angioedema in this specific clinical setting, and to identify the class of drugs possibly associated with angioedema. Patients admitted to seven different emergency departments (EDs) in Rome with the diagnosis of angioedema and urticaria were enrolled during a 6-month period. Of the 120,000 patients admitted at the EDs, 447 (0.37\u00a0%) were coded as having angioedema and 655 (0.5\u00a0%) as having urticaria. After accurate clinical review, 62 cases were defined as drug-induced, non-histaminergic angioedema. NSAIDs were the most frequent drugs (taken by 22 out of 62 patients) associated with the angioedema attack. Of the remaining patients, 15 received antibiotic treatment and 10 antihypertensive treatment. In addition, we observed in our series some cases of angioedema associated with drugs (such as antiasthmatics, antidiarrheal and antiepileptics) of which there are few descriptions in the literature. The present data, which add much needed information to the existing limited literature on drug-induced angioedema in the clinical emergency department setting, will provide more appropriate diagnosis and management of this potentially life-threatening adverse event.",

Zofenopril, an anti-hypertensive drug, was subjected to hydrolysis (acidic, alkaline and neutral), oxidation, photolysis and thermal stress, as per ICH-specified conditions. The drug showed extensive degradation under oxidative and base hydrolysis stress conditions. However, it was stable to thermal, acid, neutral and photolysis stress conditions. A total of 6 degradation products were observed and the chromatographic separation of the drug and its degradation products were achieved on Phenomenex (Luna) C18 (250mm\u00d74.6mm, i.d., 5\u03bcm) column using 20mM ammonium acetate: acetonitrile (50:50, v/v) as a mobile phase. The degradation products were characterized by LC-MS/MS and its fragmentation pathways were proposed. The LC-MS method was validated with respect to specificity, linearity, accuracy and precision. No previous reports were found in the literature regarding the degradation behavior of zofenopril.", 
    "724": "The aims of this study were to evaluate and compare proximate composition, antihypertensive activity and antioxidative capacity of the semimembranosus muscle from pork and beef and to study how these characteristics were affected by household preparation and subsequent digestion. The proximate composition was similar between pork and beef. Both pork and beef contained protein with the essential amino acids. Cooking in a heated pan did not affect the retention of lipid or sum of amino acids, but reduced the amount of the free amino acid taurine. The antihypertensive effect did not differ significantly between pork and beef, whereas the antioxidative capacity did. Cooking affected the antioxidative capacity negatively. The results from this study show that pork and beef are equally good sources of protein and bioactive properties, and whereas the nutritional composition is not affected, bioactive properties may be reduced after household preparations.",

Methods We provided losartan (at a dose of 100 mg per day) to patients with type 2 diabetes, a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (with albumin measured in milligrams and creatinine measured in grams) of at least 300, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30.0 to 89.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) of body-surface area and then randomly assigned them to receive lisinopril (at a dose of 10 to 40 mg per day) or placebo. The primary end point was the first occurrence of a change in the estimated GFR (a decline of \u2265 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) if the initial estimated GFR was \u2265 60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2) or a decline of \u2265 50% if the initial estimated GFR was <60 ml per minute per 1.73 m(2)), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or death. The secondary renal end point was the first occurrence of a decline in the estimated GFR or ESRD. Safety outcomes included mortality, hyperkalemia, and acute kidney injury. Results The study was stopped early owing to safety concerns. Among 1448 randomly assigned patients with a median follow-up of 2.2 years, there were 152 primary end-point events in the monotherapy group and 132 in the combination-therapy group (hazard ratio with combination therapy, 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.12; P=0.30). A trend toward a benefit from combination therapy with respect to the secondary end point (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.05; P=0.10) decreased with time (P=0.02 for nonproportionality). There was no benefit with respect to mortality (hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.49; P=0.75) or cardiovascular events. Combination therapy increased the risk of hyperkalemia (6.3 events per 100 person-years, vs. 2.6 events per 100 person-years with monotherapy; P<0.001) and acute kidney injury (12.2 vs. 6.7 events per 100 person-years, P<0.001).

The present study investigated the effects of perindopril on dementia of Alzheimer's type induced by d-galactose (d-gal) and aluminum trichloride (AlCl3). Perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was administered intragastrically (0.5mg/kg/day) for 60days after mice were given d-gal (150mg/kg/day) and AlCl3 (10mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally for 90days. Then, memory function was evaluated by Morris water maze test. The biochemical studies were conducted in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mouse brain after the behavioral studies. d-Gal and AlCl3 caused significant memory impairment along with significant elevation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Further, a significant reduction of superoxide dismutases (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, and elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) level in cerebral cortex and hippocampus were observed. Perindopril not only improved cognitive impairment but also restored the elevation of AChE activity induced by d-gal and AlCl3. In addition, perindopril significantly increased SOD and GSH-Px activities, reduced MDA level in cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Taken together, the above findings indicate that perindopril improves learning and memorizing probably by restoring cholinergic function and attenuating oxidative damage.",

Although the exact role of tACE in male fertility is unknown, it clearly plays a critical function in spermatogenesis. The dipeptidase domain of tACE is identical to the C-terminal catalytic domain of somatic ACE (sACE). Bradykinin potentiating peptides (BPPs) from snake venoms are the first natural sACE inhibitors described and their structure-activity relationship studies were the basis for the development of antihypertensive drugs such as captopril. In recent years, it has been showed that a number of BPPs - including BPP-10c - are able to distinguish between the N- and C-active sites of sACE, what is not applicable to captopril. Considering the similarity between tACE and sACE (and since BPPs are able to distinguish between the two active sites of sACE), the effects of the BPP-10c and captopril on the structure and function of the seminiferous epithelium were characterized in the present study. BPP-10c and captopril were administered in male Swiss mice by intraperitoneal injection (4.7 \u03bcmol/kg for 15 days) and histological sections of testes were analyzed. Classification of seminiferous tubules and stage analysis were carried out for quantitative evaluation of germ cells of the seminiferous epithelium.

We evaluated the effect of individual RAAS components on PTH using 4 interventions in humans without primary hyperaldosteronism. PTH was measured before and after study (1) low-dose angiotensin II (Ang II) infusion (1 ng/kg per minute) and captopril administration (25 mg\u00d71); study (2) high-dose Ang II infusion (3 ng/kg per minute); study (3) blinded crossover randomization to aldosterone infusion (0.7 \u00b5g/kg per hour) and vehicle; and study (4) blinded randomization to spironolactone (50 mg/daily) or placebo for 6 weeks. Infusion of Ang II at 1 ng/kg per minute acutely increased aldosterone (+148%) and PTH (+10.3%), whereas Ang II at 3 ng/kg per minute induced larger incremental changes in aldosterone (+241%) and PTH (+36%; P<0.01). Captopril acutely decreased aldosterone (-12%) and PTH (-9.7%; P<0.01). In contrast, aldosterone infusion robustly raised serum aldosterone (+892%) without modifying PTH. However, spironolactone therapy during 6 weeks modestly lowered PTH when compared with placebo (P<0.05). In vitro studies revealed the presence of Ang II type I and mineralocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein expression in normal and adenomatous human parathyroid tissues. We observed novel pleiotropic relationships between RAAS components and the regulation of PTH in individuals without primary hyperaldosteronism: the acute modulation of PTH by the RAAS seems to be mediated by Ang II, whereas the long-term influence of the RAAS on PTH may involve aldosterone. Future studies to evaluate the impact of RAAS inhibitors in treating PTH-mediated disorders are warranted.", 
    "776": "Adulthood hypertension can be prenatally programmed by maternal dietary protein deprivation. We have shown that the sympathetically mediated pressor response to physical stress is exaggerated in prenatally programmed hypertensive (PPH) rats. The mechanisms underlying this abnormal responsiveness remain undetermined. The renin-angiotensin system is known to affect sympathetic nerve activity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system attenuates the enhanced sympathetic and pressor responses to physical stress in PPH rats. Changes in renal sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure in response to hindlimb contraction, hindlimb stretch, and hindlimb intra-arterial capsaicin administration were assessed in control and PPH rats treated (from age 3 weeks) with either vehicle or the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril. Conscious resting systolic arterial pressure was significantly greater in PPH rats (142\u00b15 mm\u2009Hg) than in control (128\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg) after vehicle treatment (P<0.05). Resting systolic pressure was reduced by enalapril treatment in PPH rats (125\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg) but had no effect in control (128\u00b12 mm\u2009Hg). The pressor and renal sympathetic responses to muscle contraction and stretch were significantly higher in decerebrate PPH rats than in decerebrate control in vehicle-treated groups. Responses to capsaicin were variable. Enalapril significantly attenuated the enhanced contraction-induced elevations in mean pressure (vehicle, 45\u00b16 mm\u2009Hg; enalapril, 21\u00b13 mm\u2009Hg) and renal sympathetic activity (vehicle, 175\u00b122%; enalapril, 89\u00b123%) in PPH rats. Its effects were similar on responses to stretch in PPH rats but were equivocal during capsaicin administration. The results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the enhancement of the renal sympathetic and pressor responses to physical stress in PPH rats.",

Despite the adverse clinical effects, CC diagnosis is not straightforward and has not specifically been targeted, with therapeutic strategies only comprising interventions with appetite stimulants, and anti-inflammatory substances.

    "797": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) regulates skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity through different mechanisms. The overactivation of the ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)/Ang (angiotensin) II/AT1R (Ang II type 1 receptor) axis has been associated with the development of insulin resistance, whereas the stimulation of the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR (Mas receptor) axis improves insulin sensitivity. The in vivo mechanisms by which this axis enhances skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity are scarcely known. In this work, we investigated whether rat soleus muscle expresses the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR axis and determined the effect of Ang 1-7 on rat skeletal muscle glucose uptake in vivo. Western blot analysis revealed the expression of ACE2 and MasR, while Ang 1-7 levels were detected in rat soleus muscle by capillary zone electrophoresis. The euglycemic clamp exhibited that Ang 1-7 by itself did not promote glucose transport, but it increased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in the rat. In a similar manner, captopril (an ACE inhibitor) enhanced insulin-induced glucose uptake and this effect was blocked by the MasR antagonist A-779. Our results show for the first time that rat soleus muscle expresses the ACE2/Ang 1-7/MasR axis of the RAS, and Ang 1-7 improves insulin sensitivity by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in rat skeletal muscle in vivo. Thus, endogenous (systemic and/or local) Ang 1-7 could regulate insulin-mediated glucose transport in vivo.",

    "803": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a prominent loss of nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurons with an accompanying neuroinflammation. The peptide angiotensin II (AngII) plays a role in oxidative-stress induced disorders and is thought to mediate its detrimental actions via activation of AngII AT1 receptors. The brain renin-angiotensin system is implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including PD. Blockade of the angiotensin converting enzyme or AT1 receptors provides protection in acute animal models of parkinsonism. We demonstrate here that treatment of mice with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril protects the striatum from acutely administered 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrine (MPTP), and that chronic captopril protects the nigral DA cell bodies from degeneration in a progressive rat model of parkinsonism created by the chronic intracerebral infusion of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). The accompanying activation of microglia in the substantia nigra of MPP+-treated rats was reduced by the chronic captopril treatment. These findings indicate that captopril is neuroprotective for nigrostriatal DA neurons in both acute and chronic rodent PD models. Targeting the brain AngII pathway may be a feasible approach to slowing neurodegeneration in PD.",

    "813": "Under physiological conditions, nitric oxide (NO) is produced in the vasculature mainly by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). This endothelium-derived NO is a protective molecule with antihypertensive, antithrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus induce oxidative stress mostly by stimulation of the NADPH oxidase. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species leads to oxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), the essential cofactor of eNOS. In BH4 deficiency, oxygen reduction uncouples from NO synthesis, thereby converting eNOS to a superoxide- producing enzyme. Consequently, NO production is reduced and the pre-existing oxidative stress is enhanced, which contribute significantly to cardiovascular pathology. Therefore, pharmacological approaches that prevent eNOS uncoupling are of therapeutic interest. Among the drugs currently in clinical use, the renin inhibitor aliskiren, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor blockers, the selective aldosterone antagonist eplerenone, statins, nebivolol and pentaerithrityl tetranitrate have been shown to have the potential to prevent or reverse eNOS uncoupling under experimental conditions.

    "845": "Residual risk, the ongoing appreciable risk of major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in statin-treated patients who have achieved evidence-based lipid goals, remains a concern among cardiologists. Factors that contribute to this continuing risk are atherogenic non-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles and atherogenic processes unrelated to LDL cholesterol, including other risk factors, the inherent properties of statin drugs, and patient characteristics, ie, genetics and behaviors. In addition, providers, health care systems, the community, public policies, and the environment play a role. Major statin studies suggest an average 28% reduction in LDL cholesterol and a 31% reduction in relative risk, leaving a residual risk of about 69%. Incomplete reductions in risk, and failure to improve conditions that create risk, may result in ongoing progression of atherosclerosis, with new and recurring lesions in original and distant culprit sites, remodeling, arrhythmias, rehospitalizations, invasive procedures, and terminal disability. As a result, identification of additional agents to reduce residual risk, particularly administered together with statin drugs, has been an ongoing quest. The current model of atherosclerosis involves many steps during which disease may progress independently of guideline-defined elevations in LDL cholesterol. Differences in genetic responsiveness to statin therapy, differences in ability of the endothelium to regenerate and repair, and differences in susceptibility to nonlipid risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, and molecular changes associated with obesity and diabetes, may all create residual risk. A large number of inflammatory and metabolic processes may also provide eventual therapeutic targets to lower residual risk. Classically, epidemiologic and other evidence suggested that raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol would be cardioprotective. When LDL cholesterol is aggressively lowered to targets, low HDL cholesterol levels are still inversely related to MCVE. The efflux capacity, or ability to relocate cholesterol out of macrophages, is believed to be a major antiatherogenic mechanism responsible for reduction in MCVE mediated in part by healthy HDL. HDL cholesterol is a complex molecule with antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, antiplatelet, and vasodilatory properties, among which is protection of LDL from oxidation. HDL-associated paraoxonase-1 has a major effect on endothelial function. Further, HDL promotes endothelial repair and progenitor cell health, and supports production of nitric oxide. HDL from patients with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and autoimmune disease may fail to protect or even become proinflammatory or pro-oxidant. Mendelian randomization and other clinical studies in which raising HDL cholesterol has not been beneficial suggest that high plasma levels do not necessarily reduce cardiovascular risk. These data, coupled with extensive preclinical information about the functional heterogeneity of HDL, challenge the \"HDL hypothesis\", ie, raising HDL cholesterol per se will reduce MCVE. After the equivocal AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome With Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health Outcomes) study and withdrawal of two major cholesteryl ester transfer protein compounds, one for off-target adverse effects and the other for lack of efficacy, development continues for two other agents, ie, anacetrapib and evacetrapib, both of which lower LDL cholesterol substantially. The negative but controversial HPS2-THRIVE (the Heart Protection Study 2-Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events) trial casts further doubt on the HDL cholesterol hypothesis. The growing impression that HDL functionality, rather than abundance, is clinically important is supported by experimental evidence highlighting the conditional pleiotropic actions of HDL. Non-HDL cholesterol reflects the cholesterol in all atherogenic particles containing apolipoprotein B, and has outperformed LDL cholesterol as a lipid marker of cardiovascular risk and future mortality. In addition to including a measure of residual risk, the advantages of using non-HDL cholesterol as a primary lipid target are now compelling. Reinterpretation of data from the Treating to New Targets study suggests that better control of smoking, body weight, hypertension, and diabetes will help lower residual risk. Although much improved, control of risk factors other than LDL cholesterol currently remains inadequate due to shortfalls in compliance with guidelines and poor patient adherence. More efficient and greater use of proven simple therapies, such as aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, combined with statin therapy, may be more fruitful in improving outcomes than using other complex therapies. Comprehensive, intensive, multimechanistic, global, and national programs using primordial, primary, and secondary prevention to lower the total level of cardiovascular risk are necessary.", 
    "846": "Microvascular angina (MVA) is defined as angina pectoris caused by abnormalities of small coronary arteries. In its most typical presentation, MVA is characterized by angina attacks mainly caused by effort, evidence of myocardial ischemia on non-invasive stress tests, but normal coronary arteries at angiography. Patients with stable MVA have excellent long-term prognoses, but often present with persistent and/or worsening of angina symptoms. Treatment of MVA is initially based on standard anti-ischemic drugs (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, and nitrates), but control of symptoms is often insufficient. In these cases, several additional drugs, with different potential anti-ischemic effects, have been proposed, including ranolazine, ivabradine, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, xanthine derivatives, nicorandil, statins, alpha-blockers and, in perimenopausal women, estrogens.

We present a comprehensive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) study of the interaction of human somatic ACE with the pharmacological inhibitors captopril and lisinopril, the bradykinin potentiating peptide BPP-11b, and the food peptidic inhibitors from bovine \u03b1s2-casein, F(174)ALPQYLK(181) and F(174)ALPQY(179). SPR binding curves recorded with the high potency inhibitors captopril, lisinopril, and BPP-11b were evaluated both by regression analysis and by kinetic distribution analysis. The results indicated that captopril and lisinopril bound ACE with two K(D)'s differing by a factor 10-20 and >30, respectively (lowest K(D) = 0.1-0.3 nM for both inhibitors). This shows, for the first time in a direct binding assay with the two-domain enzyme, the existence of two binding modes of the pharmacological inhibitors, presumably with the two ACE domains. The BPP-11b-ACE binding curves were complex but showed a predominant interaction with K(D) in the nanomolar range. The caseinopeptides, known to inhibit ACE with an IC\u2085\u2080 of 4.3 \u03bcM, bound to ACE with K(D) = 3-4 \u03bcM. Mapping of the F(174)ALPQY(179) binding site on ACE by sequential binding studies using captopril or BPP-11b indicated that it bound to (or near) the two active sites of ACE, in agreement with the stoichiometry of 2 determined from data fitting.

    "862": "Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that up-regulation of the angiotensin (Ang)-converting enzyme (ACE)/AngII/AngII type 1 receptor (AT1R) axis aggravates pulmonary fibrosis. The recently discovered ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis, which counteracts the activity of the ACE/AngII/AT1R axis, has been shown to protect against pulmonary fibrosis. However, the mechanisms by which ACE2 and Ang-(1-7) attenuate pulmonary fibrosis remain unclear. We hypothesized that up-regulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis protects against bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/NF-\u03baB pathway. In vivo, Ang-(1-7) was continuously infused into Wistar rats that had received BLM or AngII. In vitro, human fetal lung-1 cells were pretreated with compounds that block the activities of AT1R, Mas (A-779), and MAPKs before exposure to AngII or Ang-(1-7). The human fetal lung-1 cells were infected with lentivirus-mediated ACE2 before exposure to AngII. In vivo, Ang-(1-7) prevented BLM-induced lung fibrosis and AngII-induced lung inflammation by inhibiting the MAPK phosphorylation and NF-\u03baB signaling cascades. However, exogenous Ang-(1-7) alone clearly promoted lung inflammation. In vitro, Ang-(1-7) and lentivirus-mediated ACE2 inhibited the AngII-induced MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway, thereby attenuating inflammation and \u03b1-collagen I production, which could be reversed by the Mas inhibitor, A-779. Ang-(1-7) inhibited AngII-induced lung fibroblast apoptotic resistance via inhibition of the MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway and activation of the BCL-2-associated X protein/caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Ang-(1-7) alone markedly stimulated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and the NF-\u03baB cascade. Up-regulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis protected against pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting the MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway. However, close attention should be paid to the proinflammatory effects of Ang-(1-7).",

    "864": "Introduction: Pulmonary venous isolation has emerged as an effective method for preventing atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence. Yet, recurrence is common. Angiotensin-receptor-blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors (ACEI) are effective in reducing the extent of myocardial remodeling and fibrosis. Our aim was to study whether pretreatment with ARBs and ACEI was effective in decreasing recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation for patients with AF. Methods: Three hundred and twelve consecutive patients who underwent ablation from 12/2006 until 7/2010 were followed for at least one year. All patients underwent MRI before ablation to assess atrial fibrosis. Data include demographic characteristics, comorbidities, AF type and information regarding treatment with ACEI or ARBs. Results: Most patients were men (62%), mean age was 64. Hypertension (HTN) was present in 60%. Their mean ejection fraction was 60%. There were 104 patients (33.3%) treated with ACEI, and 13.5 % were treated with ARBs prior to ablation. Ninety seven patients (31.1%) had AF recurrence. AF type was a significant predictor for recurrence (recurrence with paroxysmal, persistent and long-standing persistent: 23.75, 37.3 and 60%, respectively, p=0.005). The most important factor predicting recurrence was increased pre-ablation atrial fibrosis (p<0.0001). Recurrence was more frequent in patients treated with ACEI (40.4% vs 26.4% untreated patients, p=0.012). In the ARB treated group, 38.1% vs 30.0% untreated experienced recurrence (p=0.3). After multivariable adjustment for demographics, risk factors and atrial fibrosis, treatment with ACEI was associated with increased rate of recurrence in patients with persistent AF (hazard ratio: 2.6, p=0.003). There was no significant relation between ACEI pretreatment and recurrence in patients with paroxysmal AF (HR- 0.83, p=0.7), or between ARB pre-treatment and recurrence in patients with paroxysmal as well as persistent AF (p=0.2 and 0.53, respectively). Conclusions: Pretreatment with ACEI or ARBs is not associated with reduced recurrence rate in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF undergoing ablation.", 
    "865": "Treatment advances and higher participation rates in clinical trials have rapidly increased the number of survivors of childhood cancer. However, chemotherapy and radiation treatments are cardiotoxic and can cause cardiomyopathy, conduction defects, myocardial infarction, hypertension, stroke, pulmonary oedema, dyspnoea and exercise intolerance later in life. These cardiotoxic effects are often progressive and irreversible, emphasizing a need for effective prevention and treatment to reduce or avoid cardiotoxicity. Medical interventions, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, and growth hormone therapy, might be used to treat cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer survivors. Preventative strategies should include the use of dexrazoxane, which provides cardioprotection without reducing the oncological efficacy of doxorubicin chemotherapy; less-toxic anthracycline derivatives and the use of antioxidant nutritional supplements might also be beneficial. Continuous-infusion doxorubicin provides no benefit over bolus infusion in children. Identifying patient-related (for example, obesity and hypertension) and drug-related (for example, cumulative dose) risk factors for cardiotoxicity could help tailor treatments to individual patients. However, all survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of cardiotoxicity, suggesting that survivor screening recommendations for assessment of global risk of premature cardiovascular disease should apply to all survivors. Optimal, evidence-based monitoring strategies and multiagent preventative treatments still need to be identified.",

Several published studies demonstrated that aliskiren is suitable for once-daily administration and its antihypertensive effect is comparable or superior to that of other antihypertensive agents at recommended doses, with a good tolerability profile. At the moment the association with ACEIs and ARBs is not recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and renal impairment even if a recent published open-label study of low-dose aliskiren (150 mg/daily) in association with ACEIs or ARBs has demonstrated a good tolerability profile without the adverse events found in other studies. This review provides a brief overview of RAAS blocking, in particular the rationale and clinical evidence supporting the use of the DRI aliskiren, in high-risk patients with T2DM.", 
    "942": "The effects of molsidomine (a direct nitric oxide donor) on the endothelial dysfunction have never been evaluated using reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT). The objective of the MEDCOR double-blind trial will be to demonstrate the superiority of molsidomine (Coruno\u00ae 16 mg, once daily) over placebo, on improving the endothelial function (Endoscore by RH-PAT) after 12 months of treatment in stable angina patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Study design will take care of the real-life situation, in which patients are being offered PCI and stent placement (drug-eluting or bare metal), but also gold standard medical therapy (beta-blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and/or calcium antagonists). Demonstrating clinical and statistical superiority of the study drug over placebo will be a real challenge. Therefore, a sequential approach has been designed with a pilot phase aiming at recruiting 50 patients. Upon evaluation of the results by an independent data steering committee, a larger sample size phase will eventually be considered.", 
    "943": "Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) is the major hydrolase in human liver. The enzyme is involved in the metabolism of several important therapeutic agents, drugs of abuse, and endogenous compounds. However, no studies have described the role of human CES1 in the activation of two commonly prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: enalapril and ramipril. Here, we studied recombinant human CES1- and CES2-mediated hydrolytic activation of the prodrug esters enalapril and ramipril, compared with the activation of the known substrate trandolapril. Enalapril, ramipril, and trandolapril were readily hydrolyzed by CES1, but not by CES2. Ramipril and trandolapril exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics, while enalapril demonstrated substrate inhibition kinetics. Intrinsic clearances were 1.061, 0.360, and 0.02 ml/min/mg protein for ramipril, trandolapril, and enalapril, respectively. Additionally, we screened a panel of therapeutic drugs and drugs of abuse to assess their inhibition of the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate by recombinant CES1 and human liver microsomes. The screening assay confirmed several known inhibitors of CES1 and identified two previously unreported inhibitors: the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, isradipine, and the immunosuppressive agent, tacrolimus. CES1 plays a role in the metabolism of several drugs used in the treatment of common conditions, including hypertension, congestive heart failure, and diabetes mellitus; thus, there is a potential for clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The findings in the present study may contribute to the prediction of such interactions in humans, thus opening up possibilities for safer drug treatments.", 
    "944": "In this study, soft-shelled turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) egg white (SSTEW) proteins were digested by thermolysin and the resulting small peptides were further fractionated by reverse phase chromatography. Peptides with angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitory (ACEI) activity from these fractions were screened. A lysozyme-derived peptide, IW-11, from the fraction with the most effective ACEI was identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and its purified form showed effective ACEI activity in vitro (IC50=4.39\u00b10.31\u03bcM). The Lineweaver-Burk plots indicated that the inhibition towards ACE caused by this peptide is a competitive inhibition. The molecular docking study further revealed that the ACEI activity of IW-11 is mainly attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the N-terminal residue of IW-11 and the S1 pocket (Ala354 and Tyr523) and the S2' region (His513 and His353) of ACE. Moreover, the digestion parameters were further optimized and the target peptide (82% purity) was readily obtained (15% yield) without any cumbersome purification procedure. Notably, lysozyme C is the most abundant protein in SSTEW, which implies that an efficient production of this ACEI peptide from SSTEW is promising.", 
    "945": "Inhibition of ACE has proven to be an effective strategy in prevention and treatment of hypertension and related diseases. Unlike typical synthetic ACE inhibitors which exert well described side effects, food-derived peptides with ACE inhibitory activity may be safer alternatives for hypertension treatment. In this study, we comprehensively identified peptides derived from SSTEW digest using a proteomic approach. IW-11, which is derived from lysozyme, the most abundant protein in SSTEW, showed remarkable inhibition towards ACE. This peptide has been demonstrated to have a competitive inhibitory property which is able to bind to ACE active site and found to be a true inhibitor against ACE according to Lineweaver-Burk plots. Using an optimized thermolysin condition, IW-11 can be readily obtained without any complex purification step, which will benefit its further application to prevention or treatment of hypertension.",

    "951": "Antihypertensive agents may, even within the same class, exert variable effects on arterial stiffness variables. Nebivolol could have a better impact than atenolol on arterial stiffness, by increasing the bioavailability of endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) increase plasma renin activity (enhancing the production of angiotensin II via non-ACE-related pathways) whereas aliskiren does not, potentially affecting central hemodynamics differently. We compared the effects of two renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors (quinapril and aliskiren) and 2 beta-blockers (atenolol and nebivolol) on arterial stiffness variables. Treatment-na\u00efve patients (n = 72; 68.1% males; age, 47.6 \u00b1 10.6 years) with uncomplicated stage I-II essential hypertension were randomly assigned to quinapril, aliskiren, atenolol, or nebivolol for 10 weeks. Central systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), central pulse pressure (PP), augmentation index (AIx), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were measured at baseline, 2, and 10 weeks. The same measurements were performed in 20 normotensive subjects (65.0% males; age, 40.0 \u00b1 8.9 years). Peripheral and central systolic and diastolic BP, peripheral PP, and PWV were significantly and similarly reduced by all agents. However, PWV continued to decline between the second and last visit in patients on quinapril and aliskiren but did not change in those on nebivolol or atenolol. Central PP and AIx decreased in patients on quinapril, aliskiren, and nebivolol but did not change in those taking atenolol. The decrease in central PP and AIx did not differ between patients on quinapril, aliskiren, and nebivolol. Despite similar reductions in peripheral BP, atenolol is less effective than nebivolol and RAAS inhibitors in improving central pulsatile hemodynamics. Aliskiren exerts similar effects on markers of arterial stiffness as quinapril. The clinical relevance of these differences remains to be established.",

Current treatment options for AAA are quite limited as there is no proven indication for pharmacological therapy and surgery is recommended for AAA larger than 5\u00b75\u00a0cm in luminal diameter. Thus, there is a great need to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological cellular and molecular mechanisms to develop effective therapies. In this narrative review, we will discuss recent findings concerning some potential molecular and clinical aspects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in AAA pathophysiology.",

Thiorphan, captopril, and omapatrilat all enhanced the vasodilator response to bradykinin (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Omapatrilat markedly augmented the vasodilator action of adrenomedullin (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whilst thiorphan and captopril did not.

Thiorphan weakly enhanced the vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin I. Neither omapatrilat nor thiorphan had any effect on the action of a range of other vasoactive peptides including CNP.", 
    "960": "In previous research, we have demonstrated that Bifidobacterium bifidum MF 20/5 fermented milk possessed stronger angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity than other lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus helveticus DSM 13137, which produces the hypotensive casokinins Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) and Val-Pro-Pro (VPP). The aim of this study is to investigate the ACE-inhibitory peptides released in B. bifidum MF 20/5 fermented milk. The novel ACE-inhibitory peptide LVYPFP (IC50 = 132 \u03bcM) is reported here for the first time. Additionally, other bioactive peptides such as the ACE-inhibitor LPLP (IC50 = 703 \u03bcM), and the antioxidant VLPVPQK were identified. Moreover, the peptide and amino acid profiles, the ACE-inhibitory activity (ACEi), pH, and degree of hydrolysis of the fermented milk were determined and compared with those obtained in milk fermented by L. helveticus DSM 13137. The sequences of the major bioactive peptides present in fermented milk of B. bifidum and L. helveticus were identified and quantified. B. bifidum released a larger amount of peptides than L. helveticus but no IPP or VPP were detected in B. bifidum fermented milk. Also the lactotripeptide concentrations and ACEi were higher in L. helveticus fermented milk when the pH was maintained at 4.6. This may represent a technical advantage for B. bifidum that reduces the pH at a slow enough rate to facilitate the peptide generation without the need for pH control. Thus these findings show the potential for the use of this probiotic strain to produce fermented milk with a wider range of health benefits including reduction of blood pressure.",

This study aimed to investigate whether there is an association of 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency with disease progression in type II diabetic nephropathy.",

There is scarcity of data on the relationship between antihypertensive therapies and glycaemic control in Indian population. Thus, the present study was designed to investigate such association among Indian population in a University teaching hospital.The study was carried out on 177 hypertensive patients (with new onset of diabetes or without diabetes) visiting the OPD of medicine department at Majeedia hospital, New Delhi. The drug history of hypertensive patients and blood glucose levels following 1-5 yrs of antihypertensive therapy were recorded.The gender distribution of hypertensive patients reveals a higher percentage of incidences in males (53.7%) as compared to females (46.3%). Hypertensive patient without DM on beta blockers and on thiazide shows higher incidence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (17.5%, 18.5%) and DM (10%, 11%) as compared to patient receiving other antihypertensive therapy. While in patients of new onset diabetes the incidence was higher with \u03b2-blockers (56.2%) than with thiazides (31.3%) followed by calcium channel blockers (CCBs) (12.5%). There was proportionate increase in incidence with the duration of therapy (3-5 years). None of the patients who were on ACE inhibitors or on angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reported any incidence of IGT or DM.To conclude, \u03b2-blockers and thiazides increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus with long term antihypertensive therapy requiring regular monitoring. CCBs have lowered risks while ACE inhibitors and ARBs are relatively free of such metabolic adverse effects.", 
    "966": "To determine the angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of marine cryptides, different methods were tested. ACE inhibition was measured using two synthetic substrates, (N-[3-(2-furyl) acryloyl]-Phe-Gly-Gly (FAPGG) and N-hippuryl-His-Leu hydrate salt (HHL)), and a natural one, angiotensin-I. The IC50 value (defined as the concentration of inhibitory molecule needed to inhibit 50% of the ACE activity) of the reference synthetic inhibitor captopril was in the nanomolar range (1.79-15.1 nM) when synthetic substrates were used, whereas it exhibited IC50 of micromolar range (16.71 \u03bcM) with angiotensin-I. We chose losartan, an antagonist of angiotensin-II receptor as negative control for the ACE inhibition. Losartan was also able to inhibit ACE whatever the substrate tested, with IC50 of micromolar range (17.13-146 \u03bcM). We defined this value as a limit above which molecules are not showing in vitro ACE inhibitory activity. Val-Trp (VW), Val-Tyr (VY), Lys-Tyr (KY), Lys-Trp (KW), Ile-Tyr (IY), Ala-Pro (AP), Val-Ile-Tyr (VIY), Leu-Lys-Pro (LKP), Gly-Pro-Leu (GPL), Ala-Lys-Lys (AKK), and Val-Ala-Pro (VAP) were tested as inhibitors of ACE with synthetic and natural substrates. IC50 displayed were substrate-dependent. With FAPGG as substrate, IW, VAP, KY, IY, AP, AKK, and VIY show IC50 values over the IC50 value of losartan and should not be considered as inhibitors of ACE. VY, VW, KW, and LKP exhibited IC50 value lower than the IC50 value of losartan for all substrates tested and were thus considered as good candidates for effectively decreasing hypertension. It appears that the comparison of IC50 is not consistent when IC50 values are obtained with different substrates and different methods. In vitro ACE inhibitory activity assays should always include various ACE substrates and references such as captopril and a negative control to obtain data reliable to discriminate ACE inhibitory peptides.", 
    "967": "Victims of a radiological attack or nuclear accident may receive high-dose, heterogeneous exposures from radiation to the chest that lead to lung damage. Our goal is to develop countermeasures to mitigate such injuries. We used WAG/RijCmcr rats receiving 13 Gy to the whole thorax to induce pulmonary fibrosis within 210 days. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril was evaluated as a mitigator of these injuries at two doses (18 and 36 mg/m(2)/day) and 8 schedules: starting at 7, 35, 70, 105 and 140 days and continuing to 210 days or starting at 7 days and stopping at 30, 60 or 90 days after whole-thorax irradiation. The earliest start date at 7 days after irradiation would provide an adequate window of time for triage and dosimetry. Survival after 35 days, as permitted by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) was also recorded as a primary end point of pneumonitis. Pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated using the Sircol biochemical assay to measure lung collagen. Our results indicated that a short course of either dose of enalapril from 7-90 days improved survival. However, pulmonary fibrosis was only mitigated by the higher dose of enalapril (36 mg/m(2)/day). The latest effective start date for the drug was 35 days after irradiation. These results indicate that ACE inhibitors can be started at least a month after irradiation for mitigation of pneumonitis and/or pulmonary fibrosis.",

Based on support vector regression (SVR), a novel rapid selection method called binary matrix resetting filter (BMRF) was proposed to nonlinearly select high-dimensional features and then multiround last-elimination (MRLE) was used for subtle screening. The reserved descriptors were used to construct the regression model with SVR, which was then applied to the quantitative sequence-activity model (QSAM) analysis for two oligopeptide systems. Compared with the widely used 16 kinds of amino acid descriptors, four QSAM modeling methods and four feature selection methods, our work shows a significant improvement in modeling performance, especially in external prediction. Furthermore, the real biochemical significance corresponding to reserved descriptors can be given directly, and the interpretability of the established QSAM model is improved significantly. This novel method has a high potential to become an available tool for regression analysis of high-dimension data, such as QSAM modeling of peptides or even proteins.",

    "999": "Although reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are generated as the natural byproduct of normal oxygen metabolism, they can create oxidative damage via interaction with bio-molecules. The role of oxidative stress as a remarkable upstream part is frequently reported in the signaling cascade of inflammation as well as chemo attractant production. Even though hydrogen peroxide can control cell signaling and stimulate cell proliferation at low levels, in higher concentrations it can initiate apoptosis and in very high levels may create necrosis. So far, the role of ROS in cellular damage and death is well documented with implicating in a broad range of degenerative alterations e.g. carcinogenesis, aging and other oxidative stress related diseases (OSRDs). Reversely, it is cleared that antioxidants are potentially able to suppress (at least in part) the immune system and to enhance the normal cellular protective responses to tissue damage. In this review, we aimed to provide insights on diverse OSRDs, which are correlated with the concept of oxidative stress as well as its cellular effects that can be inhibited by antioxidants. Resveratrol, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, nebivolol and carvedilol, pentaerythritol tetranitrate, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, and plant-derived drugs (alone or combined) are the potential medicines that can be used to control OSRD.",

To investigate the underlying mechanism, we examined the effect of this polymorphism on B1-receptor-mediated coronary artery dilation and peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation. Vasorelaxant responses of human coronary microarteries from subjects without coronary disease to des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and to bradykinin were studied in organ bath experiments. Des-Arg9-bradykinin responses were endothelium-dependent and exclusively mediated by B1 receptors, whereas responses to bradykinin were induced through B2 receptors (bradykinin type 2 receptors). The presence of the G allele reduced the response to 3 \u00d7 10(-8) mol/l des-Arg(9)-bradykinin by 29% [AA (n=13) compared with AG/GG (n=8); P<0.03], and tended to lower concentration-related responses (P=0.065) to this agonist, whereas the responses to bradykinin were unaffected by the rs12050217 genotype. In freshly obtained human mononuclear cells 1 \u03bcmol/l des-Arg(9)-bradykinin increased expression of the pro-inflammatory factors CXCL5 (CXC chemokine ligand 5) and IL6 (interleukin-6).

IL-1\u03b2 (interleukin-1\u03b2) increased CXCL5 and IL6 expression in both genders, and this response was not associated with 17\u03b2-oestradiol levels. The gender difference in responses to B1 receptor stimulation in blood mononuclear cells implies possible gender differences in the response to ACE inhibitor therapy, which needs to be studied more comprehensively.

Proximal tubular epithelial cells are the main sites of MK expression in the kidneys. The pathophysiological roles of MK are diverse, ranging from the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) to the progression of chronic kidney disease, often accompanied by hypertension, renal ischaemia and diabetic nephropathy. The obvious hypertension that develops in Mdk(+/+) mouse models of renal ablation compared with Mdk(-/-) mice eventually leads to progressive renal failure, such as glomerular sclerosis and tubulointerstitial damage associated with elevated plasma angiotensin (Ang) II levels. MK is also induced in the lung endothelium by oxidative stress and subsequently up-regulated by ACE, which hydrolyzes Ang II to induce further oxidative stress, thus accelerating MK generation; this leads to a vicious cycle of positive feedback in the MK-Ang II pathway. Kidney-lung interactions involving positive feedback between the renin-angiotensin system and MK might partly account for the pathogenesis of hypertension and kidney damage. MK is also involved in the pathogenesis of AKI and diabetic nephropathy through the recruitment of inflammatory cells. In contrast, MK plays a protective role against crescentic glomerulonephritis, by down-regulating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. These diverse actions of MK might open up new avenues for targeted approaches to treating hypertension and various renal diseases.",

The proportions exercising moderately, with recommended alcohol and sodium intakes, and with a normal body mass index were 8.3, 41.4, 28.9, and 17.5 %, respectively. 83.3 % of HF patients were taking only one of the recommended four classes of drugs [\u03b2-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEIs/ARBs), diuretics, and digoxin]; only 50.1 % were additionally on a lipid-lowering agent.",

Due to the limited effect of monotherapy, 2 or more antihypertensive agents are required in at least two-third of the hypertensive population. Because of their complementary blood pressure-lowering mechanisms and proven efficacy, it is advisable to initiate a combination of a renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) blocking agent with a RAS-independent agent; the choice of initial agents depends on age, ethnicity and co-morbidity. It is preferable that treatment is started using a stepwise approach: 1 agent is started and a second or third agent is added to the regimen. If the patient's actual blood pressure exceeds the target value by more than 20/10 mmHg, an alternative approach would be to start immediately with 2 agents. Compliance to therapy and the continuation of antihypertensive treatment are notoriously poor; treatment using a combination preparation containing 2 or even 3 different components is therefore preferred.", 
    "1035": "The goal of the present review is to examine the evidence for beneficial actions of manipulation of the RAS (renin-angiotensin system) in stroke, with particular focus on Ang-(1-7) [angiotensin-(1-7)] and its receptor Mas. The RAS appears to be highly involved in the multifactorial pathophysiology of stroke. Blocking the effects of AngII (angiotensin II) at AT1R (AngII type\u00a01 receptor), through the use of commonly prescribed ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors or AT1R blockers, has been shown to have therapeutic effects in both ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke. In contrast with the deleterious actions of over activation of AT1R by AngII, stimulation of AT2Rs (AngII type\u00a02 receptors) in the brain has been demonstrated to elicit beneficial effects in stroke. Likewise, the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis of the RAS has been shown to have therapeutic effects in stroke when activated, countering the effects of the ACE/AngII/AT1R axis. Studies have demonstrated that activating this axis in the brain elicits beneficial cerebral effects in rat models of ischaemic stroke, and we have also demonstrated the cerebroprotective potential of this axis in haemorrhagic stroke using stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and collagenase-induced striatal haemorrhage. The mechanism of cerebroprotection elicited by ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas activation includes anti-inflammatory effects within the brain parenchyma. The major hurdle to overcome in translating these results to humans is devising strategies to activate the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas cerebroprotective axis using post-stroke treatments that can be administered non-invasively.",

Traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus or dyslipidemia, are more prevalent in SLE patients than in the general population, but they cannot fully account for accelerated atherosclerosis in SLE. In fact, a number of nontraditional risk factors have been identified, including disease activity, damage and various treatments. Preventive strategies for CHD are mandatory in SLE patients and should include giving up smoking; performing regular physical activity; managing metabolic abnormalities such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes; treating persistent disease activity; and minimizing chronic exposure to corticosteroids.

Of 13,498 patients with AMI, 2769 (20.5%) had CHF on admission. Compared to CHF patients with preserved renal function, in-hospital mortality and major adverse cardiac events were increased both at 1 month and at 1 year after discharge in patients with renal dysfunction (1154; 41.7%). Postdischarge use of aspirin, betablockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers and statins significantly reduced the 1-year mortality rate for CHF patients with renal dysfunction; such reduction was not observed for those without renal dysfunction, except in the case of aspirin.

Molecular models showed that imidapril bound directly to the mouse MMP-9 active center. An active form of imidapril, imidaprilat, dose-dependently inhibited MMP-9 activity in the extract from elastase-induced AAA in wild-type mice. Imidapril (10 mg/kg per day) was administered to wild-type or angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor knockout mice. Blood pressure was significantly lower in AT1 receptor-knockout mice than in wild-type mice, but imidapril did not affect blood pressure in AT1 receptor-knockout mice. The aortic diameter was significantly expanded after elastase application, but the expansion was significantly lower in AT1 receptor-knockout mice than in wild-type mice. In AT1 receptor-knockout mice, the aortic expansion was further attenuated by imidapril. MMP-9 activity in aorta was significantly augmented after elastase application. The MMP-9 activity was significantly lower in AT1 receptor-knockout mice than in wild-type mice, and it was further attenuated by imidapril. In conclusion, MMP-9 inhibition by imidapril might contribute to the attenuation of AAA progression in AT1 receptor-knockout mice.",

    "1049": "Bowman's capsule parietal epithelial cell activation occurs in several human proliferative glomerulonephritides. The cellular composition of the resulting hyperplastic lesions is controversial, although a population of CD133(+)CD24(+) progenitor cells has been proposed to be a major constituent. Mediator(s) involved in proliferation and migration of progenitor cells into the Bowman's space have been poorly explored. In a series of 36 renal biopsies of patients with proliferative and nonproliferative glomerulopathies, dysregulated CD133(+)CD24(+) progenitor cells of the Bowman's capsule invade the glomerular tuft exclusively in proliferative disorders. Up-regulation of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor on progenitor cells was accompanied by high expression of its ligand, SDF-1, in podocytes. Parietal epithelial cell proliferation might be sustained by increased expression of the angiotensin II (Ang II) type-1 (AT1) receptor. Similar changes of CXCR4, SDF-1, and AT1 receptor expression were found in Munich Wistar Fr\u00f6mter rats with proliferative glomerulonephritis. Moreover, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor normalized CXCR4 and AT1 receptor expression on progenitors concomitant with regression of crescentic lesions in a patient with crescentic glomerulonephritis. These results suggest that glomerular hyperplastic lesions derive from the proliferation and migration of renal progenitors in response to injured podocytes. The Ang II/AT1 receptor pathway may participate, together with SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, to the dysregulated response of renal precursors. Thus, targeting the Ang II/AT1 receptor/CXCR4 pathways may be beneficial in severe forms of glomerular proliferative disorders.",

We used BKS.Cg-+Lepr(db)/+Lepr(db) (db/db) mice, a genetic animal model of obese type 2 diabetes. Diabetic db/db mice suffered from glomerular hyperfiltration, albuminuria and hypoalbuminemia. Oral administration of 5\u2009mg/kg/day of imidapril for 3 weeks suppressed renal hyperfiltration, reduced albuminuria and normalized hypoalbuminemia. Imidapril did not influence body weights, blood pressure or blood glucose concentrations in db/db mice. Urinary excretion of heparan sulfate (HS) in non-treated 11-week-old db/db mice was significantly lower than that in age-matched non-diabetic db/+m mice. HS is a component of HS proteoglycans, which are present in glomerular basement membranes and glycocalyx of cell surfaces. Reduced urinary HS excretion indicated glomerular HS loss in db/db mice. Imidapril increased urinary excretion of HS to concentrations observed in db/+m mice, indicating that imidapril prevented the loss of renal HS. These results suggest that imidapril ameliorates renal hyperfiltration and loss of renal contents of HS. Improvement of filtration function and maintenance of HS, which is an important structural component of glomeruli, may contribute to renoprotective effects of imidapril.",

Standard HF pharmacological and device therapies do little to moderate the wide spectrum of insidious age-related processes that are elemental to HF pathophysiology among older patients. Moreover, the utility of standard HF therapy is usually premised on its efficacy for life prolongation, whereas quality of life, increased physical and cognitive function, and preserved independence may be regarded as higher (or even highest) priority.

We report a case report of anaphylactic reaction directly attributable to intravenous (IV) recombinant tissue plasminogen activator and identify additional cases through review of the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. A systematic review of Adverse Event Reporting System was performed for allergic adverse events occurring in conjunction with IV thrombolytics. We reviewed 924 adverse events which occurred between 2004 and 2012 that were associated with thrombolytics. We subsequently acquired detailed individual safety reports of 33 cases in which allergic events were documented. Out of the 33 reports, there were 12 cases (age range, 57-93 years) of adverse allergic reaction directly attributable to IV thrombolytics. Allergic reactions included angioedema, facial swelling, urticaria, skin rash, cutaneous hypesthesia, hypotension, anaphylactic shock, and death. Of the patients who were reported to suffer from allergic adverse events, 11 received IV alteplase and 1 received IV reteplase. Most reactions associated with IV alteplase resolved with withdrawal of medication and treatment with diphenhydramine and steroids \u00b1 epinephrine. There was 1 death directly attributable to allergic reaction in a patient who received IV reteplase for MI.Although IV alteplase is identical to endogenous tissue plasminogen activator, it appears to be the most common cause of allergic reaction among currently used thrombolytics, with or without concomitant administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system reduce proteinuria and slow down the progression of the disease. However, their effect is suboptimal, and residual proteinuria persists as an important predictor of renal impairment. Vitamin D has pleiotropic effects that could have an impact on these parameters. In this study, we critically review the molecular and experimental bases that suggest an antiproteinuric effect of vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation and the available evidence on its antiproteinuric effect in clinical practice. In animal models, we have observed the antiproteinuric effect of VDR activation, which could be due to direct protective action on the podocyte or other pleiotropic effects that slow down RAA system activation, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials have generally been conducted in patients with a vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and the main trial (VITAL) did not demonstrate that paricalcitol improved the study's primary endpoint (decrease in the urine albumin to creatinine ratio). In this sense, the information available is insufficient to advise the use of native vitamin D or VDR activators as renoprotective antiproteinuric drugs beyond the experimental level.

Upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease account for most chronic cough after excluding smoking, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, and chronic bronchitis. Many patients have more than one reason for chronic cough. Treating the underlying cause(s) resolves cough in most instances. There are some coughs that seem refractory despite an extensive work-up. The possibility of a hypersensitive cough reflex response has been proposed to explain these cases. Several clinical algorithms to evaluate chronic cough are presented.",

A linear mixed model was used to assess the effect of BP on left ventricular mass index, which was measured at three different visits, and a mixed logistic model was used to assess left ventricular hypertrophy. These models were part of a joint longitudinal and survival model to adjust for informative dropout. Predictors of left ventricular mass index included systolic BP, anemia, and use of antihypertensive medications other than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Predictors of left ventricular hypertrophy included systolic BP, female sex, anemia, and use of other antihypertensive medications. Over 4 years, the adjusted prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy decreased from 15.3% to 12.6% in a systolic BP model and from 15.1% to 12.6% in a diastolic BP model.

The efficacy of the field dose of temephos at killing this resistant Cucuta population was greatly reduced, with mortality rates <80% two weeks after application and <50% after 4 weeks. Neither biochemical assays nor partial sequencing of the ace-1 gene implicated target site resistance as the primary resistance mechanism. Synergism assays and microarray analysis suggested that metabolic mechanisms were most likely responsible for the temephos resistance. Interestingly, although the greatest synergism was observed with the carboxylesterase inhibitor, DEF, the primary candidate genes from the microarray analysis, and confirmed by quantitative PCR, were cytochrome P450 oxidases, notably CYP6N12, CYP6F3 and CYP6M11.", 
    "1154": "In Colombia, resistance to temephos in Ae. aegypti compromises the duration of its effect as a vector control tool. Several candidate genes potentially responsible for metabolic resistance to temephos were identified. Given the limited number of insecticides that are approved for vector control, future chemical-based control strategies should take into account the mechanisms underlying the resistance to discern which insecticides would likely lead to the greatest control efficacy while minimizing further selection of resistant phenotypes.", 
    "1155": "We have previously observed that many of the renal and hemodynamic adaptations seen in normal pregnancy can be induced in virgin female rats by chronic systemic vasodilation. Fourteen-day vasodilation with sodium nitrite or nifedipine (NIF) produced plasma volume expansion (PVE), hemodilution, and increased renal medullary phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) protein. The present study examined the role of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in this mechanism. Virgin females were treated for 14 days with NIF (10 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) via diet), NIF with spironolactone [SPR; mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blocker, 200-300 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) via diet], NIF with losartan [LOS; angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor blocker, 20 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) via diet], enalapril (ENAL; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, 62.5 mg/l via water), or vehicle (CON). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced 7.4 \u00b1 0.5% with NIF, 6.33 \u00b1 0.5% with NIF + SPR, 13.3 \u00b1 0.9% with NIF + LOS, and 12.0 \u00b1 0.4% with ENAL vs. baseline MAP. Compared with CON (3.6 \u00b1 0.3%), plasma volume factored for body weight was increased by NIF (5.2 \u00b1 0.4%) treatment but not by NIF + SPR (4.3 \u00b1 0.3%), NIF + LOS (3.6 \u00b1 0.1%), or ENAL (4.0 \u00b1 0.3%). NIF increased PDE5A protein abundance in the renal inner medulla, and SPR did not prevent this increase (188 \u00b1 16 and 204 \u00b1 22% of CON, respectively). NIF increased the \u03b1-subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (\u03b1-ENaC) protein in renal outer (365 \u00b1 44%) and inner (526 \u00b1 83%) medulla, and SPR prevented these changes. There was no change in either PDE5A or \u03b1-ENaC abundance vs. CON in rats treated with NIF + LOS or ENAL. These data indicate that the PVE and renal medullary adaptations in response to chronic vasodilation result from RAAS signaling, with increases in PDE5A mediated through AT1 receptor and \u03b1-ENaC through the MR.", 
    "1156": "The hypercoagulability of patients with nephrotic syndrome could be an important trigger for arterial and venous thrombotic events. Arterial thromboses are less frequent than venous thromboses and the most common locations are femoral arteries. The association of stroke and nephrotic syndrome is extremely rare. Here we report the case of a patient with stroke as first manifestation of nephrotic syndrome. Ischemic stroke can be the first manifestation of nephrotic syndrome and should be considered as a possible complication of the syndrome, when the commonest causes of ischemic stroke are excluded and especially in presence of pre-existing glomerular disease.", 
    "1157": "Among African-Americans adults, arterial hypertension is both more prevalent and associated with more complications than among white adults. Hypertension is also epidemic among black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The treatment of hypertension among black adults may be complicated by lesser response to certain classes of anti-hypertensive agents.", 
    "1158": "We systematically searched literature for clinical trials of ACE-inhibitors among hypertensive adults comparing blood pressure response between whites and blacks. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response. Further analysis including meta-regressions, funnel plots, and one-study-removed analyses were performed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity or bias.", 
    "1159": "In a meta-analysis of 13 trials providing 17 different patient groups for evaluation, black race was associated with a lesser reduction in systolic (mean difference: 4.6 mmHg (95% CI 3.5-5.7)) and diastolic (mean difference: 2.8 mmHg (95% CI 2.2-3.5)) blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors, with little heterogeneity. Meta-regression revealed only ACE-inhibitor dosage as a significant source of heterogeneity. There was little evidence of publication bias.", 
    "1160": "Black race is consistently associated with a clinically significant lesser reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to ACE-inhibitor therapy in clinical trials in the USA and Europe. In black adults requiring monotherapy for uncomplicated hypertension, drugs other than ACE-inhibitors may be preferred, though the proven benefits of ACE-inhibitors in some sub-groups and the large overlap of response between blacks and whites must be remembered. These data are particularly important for interpretation of clinical drug trials for hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa and for the development of treatment recommendations in this population.", 
    "1161": "We evaluated the effects of RU28318 (RU), a selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist, Captopril (Capt), an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, and Losartan (Los), an angiotensin receptor blocker, alone or in combination with ischemia/reperfusion- (I/R-) induced cardiac dysfunction in hearts obtained from normal and diabetic rats.", 
    "1162": "Isolated hearts were perfused for 30 min and then subjected to 30 min of global ischemia (I) followed by a period of 30 min of reperfusion (R). Drugs were administered for 30 min either before or after ischemia. Drug regimens tested were RU, Capt, Los, RU + Capt, RU + Los, Capt + Los, and RU + Capt + Los (Triple). Recovery of cardiac hemodynamics was evaluated.", 
    "1163": "Recovery of cardiac function was up to 5-fold worse in hearts obtained from diabetic animals compared to controls. Treatment with RU was generally better in preventing or reversing ischemia-induced cardiac dysfunction in normal hearts compared to treatment with Capt or Los alone. In diabetic hearts, RU was generally similarly effective as Capt or Los treatment.", 
    "1164": "RU treatment locally might be considered as an effective therapy or preventative measure in cardiac I/R injury. Importantly, RU was the most effective at improving -dP/dt (a measure of diastolic function) when administered to diabetic hearts after ischemia.", 
    "1165": "Non-response is a serious threat to the external validity of longitudinal psychosocial studies. Little is known about potential systematic differences between patients with coronary artery disease who complete a psychosocial study and those who drop out prematurely due to non-response, or whether drop-outs may have a different cardiovascular risk. We studied a cohort of 1132 consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). At baseline, all patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Type D Scale (DS14). At 12 months follow-up, 70.8% (n\u2009=\u2009802) of patients completed both questionnaires, while 29.2% (n\u2009=\u2009330) dropped out. We observed significant differences in socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological baseline characteristics between completers and drop-outs. Drop-outs were younger, more likely to smoke, but less often prescribed cardiovascular medications, including calcium antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as compared with completers. Drop-outs more often had depression, anxiety, and negative affectivity, as compared with completers (all p-values <0.05). After a median follow-up of 4 years, we found no significant differences in mortality risk between completers and drop-outs (6.5 vs. 7.3%; adjusted HR 1.34, 95% CI 0.82-2.19, respectively). In conclusion, a possible attrition bias occurred, as drop-outs and completers differed systematically on some socio-demographic, clinical, and psychological baseline characteristics. Despite these differences, this did not translate into a poorer short-term prognosis, as there were no differences in the mortality risk of completers vs. drop-outs after a median follow-up of 4 years. In future prospective studies, attention should be paid to attrition bias, and its possible impact on study results and implications should be discussed."
