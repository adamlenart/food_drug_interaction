The distal aspect of the arms was also involved in 2 patients; the face was always spared. Civatte's poikiloderma was associated with this hyperpigmentation in 9 patients. Epidermal atrophy, basal layer hyperpigmentation, elastosis and angiectases were histopathologic features. Pregnancy, menopause, local inflammation, and cosmetics were not predisposing factors. Undue sun exposure, oral contraceptives or estrogens were found only occasionally. Sixty-five percent of patients had hypertension and had been taking antihypertensive drugs, especially angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, for years before pigmentation began. Acquired brachial cutaneous dyschromatosis (ABCD) is the suggested title of this disorder, which is not rare. Its prevalence in postmenopausal women, the hypopigmented macules, and the absence of a relation with estrogens, pregnancy, or hormone replacement therapy, all help to distinguish ABCD from melasma. An association with Civatte's poikiloderma as well as hypertension and/or antihypertensive drugs is suggested.",

    "27": "To elucidate possible mechanisms of activity in medicinal plants containing flavonoids, the inhibitory potency of twenty flavones, flavonols, flavanones, phenylacrylic acids and various hydroxylated phenylacetic acids on the activity of neutral endopeptidase (NEP; EC 3.4.24.11), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) and aminopeptidase N (APN; EC 3.4.11.2) was investigated in vitro. The screening generally resulted that inhibition of these enzymes requires free hydroxyl groups at the flavone molecule. Flavone and methoxylated compounds (sinensetin) were without effects. Flavonoids with free hydroxyl functions in position 3',4' and 5,7 inhibited the activity of NEP (quercetin, luteolin, fisetin), with myricetin (IC50 = 42 microM) as strongest inhibitor. Inhibition of ACE and APN did not depend on this class of compounds and substitution pattern. E.g. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and 4-methylcatechol (urinary metabolites of flavonoids) also inhibited both APN and ACE activity, but not NEP activity. The results demonstrate that some of the pharmacological activities of flavonoids might be related to the inhibition of metallopeptidases responsible for the splitting of regulatory neuropeptides.",

    "29": "Transient ischemia has been shown to impair endothelium-dependent, but not endothelium-independent, coronary vasodilation, indicating selective endothelial dysfunction. Here a hypothesis was tested that agonist mediated activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and the related overproduction of the oxidative species contribute to the mechanism of the endothelial dysfunction. Perfused guinea-pig hearts were subjected either to 30 min global ischemia/30 min reperfusion or to 30 min aerobic perfusion with a PKC activator, phorbol ester (1 n M, PMA). Coronary flow responses to a bolus of acetylcholine (ACh) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were used as measures of endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vascular function, respectively. Salicylate hydroxylation was used as the assay for the myocardial hydroxyl radical (.OH) formation. Both ischemia/reperfusion and PMA impaired the ACh response and augmented the myocardial.OH production. The effect of ischemia/reperfusion on the ACh response: (i) was fully prevented by a PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine (2microM) and a mixed endothelin blocker, bosentan (20microM); (ii) was partially prevented by an endothelin converting-enzyme inhibitor, phosphoramidon (40microM), and superoxide dismutase (150-500 U/ml, SOD) and (iii) was affected neither by catalase (600 U/ml) nor by losartan (20microM) and captopril (250microM), nor by prazosin (10microM). SOD, but not bosentan, partially prevented the effect of PMA on the ACh response. None of the interventions studied affected the SNP response. The reperfusion-induced.OH release was attenuated by chelerythrine and bosentan, was not affected by prazosin and was increased by SOD. These results implicate the following sequence of events in the mechanism of the post-ischemic endothelial dysfunction: ischemia/reperfusion, endothelin-induced PKC activation, increased production of superoxide and/or some of its toxic metabolite, damage to the endothelium and endothelial dysfunction. The results argue against the contribution of angiotensin II, adrenergicalpha(1)-receptors and kinins in the mechanism of the post-ischemic endothelial dysfunction in guinea-pig hearts.", 
    "30": "Long-term administration of N(G)-nitro- L -arginine methyl ester (L -NAME) induces development of NO-deficient hypertension and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. In this work, we examined the effect of spontaneous and captopril-induced recovery on LV hypertrophy and protein composition in rats with developed L -NAME-induced hypertension. Four groups of rats were investigated: control L -NAME 40 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks (L -NAME) L -NAME 40 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks followed by 3-week spontaneous recovery (L -NAME+R) L -NAME 40 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks followed by 3 weeks of captopril treatment at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day (L -NAME+C). LV hypertrophy in the L -NAME group was associated with an increase in content and concentration of left ventricular DNA and RNA, concentration of metabolic proteins (MP) and soluble collagenous proteins (SCP). Spontaneous recovery period reduced the hypertension, without regression of LV hypertrophy. Left ventricular DNA and RNA content were increased in the L -NAME+R group. In this group, concentrations of MP, contractile proteins (CP), and collagenous proteins did not differ from those in the L -NAME group. Captopril treatment caused total regression of hypertension and LV hypertrophy and decreased both content and concentration of DNA and RNA, as well as the contents of MP, CP and SCP v the L -NAME group. However, after captopril treatment, concentration of collagenous and non-collagenous protein fractions remained increased v control. We conclude that spontaneous regression of L -NAME-induced hypertension is not associated with regression of LV hypertrophy. LV hypertrophy was regressed only in captopril-treated animals.", 
    "31": "The role of the Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC) is to manage pharmaceutical subsidy expenditure in New Zealand. PHARMAC has adopted a proactive approach. It selects the drugs that are to be subsidized and declines to subsidize others. It has established reference pricing across many drug groups, has entered into a range of innovative commercial contracts with pharmaceutical companies, and has encouraged greater price competition among pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices and control expenditure risk. These initiatives have all been part of an overarching strategy to improve the value of the government's expenditure on pharmaceuticals. PHARMAC has also developed techniques of cost-utility analysis to assess the value of expenditure. PHARMAC has slowed pharmaceutical expenditure growth, culminating in a fall in expenditure in the 1998/1999 year. At the same time, patient access has continued to expand, with more prescriptions being written and new drugs being subsidized. Therefore, PHARMAC has made dramatic strides to improve the value of the government's expenditure on pharmaceutical subsidies and its actions have meant that more funds have been available for investment in other health services, than would have occurred if previous policies had remained unchanged.", 
    "32": "Despite the (modest) regression observed in the MONICA study, coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of mortality in industrialised countries and it is worryingly progressive in emerging countries. Therapeutic progress has been considerable but only a small number of coronary patients benefit from it. The techniques are costly and justify efforts to improve selection of high risk patients. The results of the VA-HIT study, which demonstrated the importance of HDL cholesterol level in prevention, now raise the question of the optimal treatment of these patients and that of the association of fibrates and statins. The value of ACE inhibitors in the HOPE study in coronary artery disease was outstanding. In parallel, the efficacy of Mediterranean diet has been confirmed in secondary prevention as that of supplements of omega-3 fatty acids in the GISSI-Prevenzione study. When reference anti-anginal agents are ineffective in the most resistant forms of coronary artery disease, other classes of drugs have been shown to be effective in association. Finally, the theory of inflammation and infection of atherosclerosis has found new indirect arguments, whereas angiogenesis and vasculogenesis have been confirmed as the main leaders in the future treatment of coronary artery disease.", 
    "33": "Cardiac failure has become a major but underestimated public health problem. The EPICAL study in France confirmed the severity of this condition. In addition to the neuro-hormones, the role played by inflammatory cytokines in the progression of the disease has been emphasized. The importance of the \"genetic background\" in the development and evolution of cardiac failure has been demonstrated (deletion or prospective polymorphism). From the therapeutic point of view, besides the hopes raised by multisite pacing, the betablockers and spironolactone have been shown to provide major functional improvement and prolonged survival, and they take their place with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in our pharmacological arsenal. Cellular transplantation is associated with encouraging pre-clinical results which open up a new field of interest. Finally, global management, including physical rehabilitation and patient education by plury-disciplinary teams, provides medical and economic benefits. The year 1999 has been particularly rich in the field of cardiac failure from the basis of fundamental research to the organisation of health care.", 
    "34": "THE RELIEF OF THE RESULTS OF THE HOPE TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO THE INCIDENCE OF CEREBROVASCULAR EVENT UNDER ACE INHIBITOR THERAPY: In 1998, the CAPP trial had raised a serious concern about whether captopril therapy increased the risk of cerebrovascular accidents. When compared with betablocker therapy (+/- diuretics) in 11,000 hypertensives, there was a very worrying number of excess cerebrovascular accidents in the captopril group (+25%) (with no difference in the number of cerebrovascular accidents overall). There were several reasons which led to believe that the captopril was not the causal factor. But a doubt remained. In 1999, the results of the HOPE trial with ramipril, though not primarily for a hypertensive population, provided reassurance beyond the investigators' hopes concerning the value of ACE inhibitors in the prevention of vascular events, including cerebrovascular accidents. THE FRAMINGHAM EXPERIENCE OF LVH AND THE TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION: The Framingham study reported unique data concerning the effects of antihypertensive therapy on LVH in 10,333 subjects of 45 to 74 years of age followed up for 40 years (1950-1989). As the incidence of antihypertensive therapy increased during the observation period, that of hypertension and LVH decreased in parallel. Although these data were retrospective, they are compatible with a causal relationship between the treatment and regression of LVH. This could explain up to 50% of the decrease in cardiovascular mortality observed in the United States during this period. The Framingham study so reposition, in an epidemiological context, the considerable benefits of antihypertensive therapy and of the regression of the associated LVH. THE SEVERITY OF THE WHO AND IHS RECOMMENDATIONS: Less than 130/85: this is the target value of the blood pressure in adults under antihypertensive therapy according to WHO and IHS. In patients with diabetes or renal failure with proteinuria > 1 g/j, the target is even lower. These recommendations incite physicians to beware of any laxness in the treatment of hypertension. The most recent epidemiological data from France indicates that only a minority of the hypertensive patients under treatment are well controlled and that this advice is probably not superfluous. Moreover, in the decision to treat hypertension (drug therapy or not), these recommendations underline the evaluation of the individual risk of the subject on the basis of associated risk factors, target organ complications and previous history of vascular events.", 
    "35": "In the HOT-study 18,790 patients in 26 countries (age 50-80 years, mean age 61.5 years) with hypertension (diastolic blood pressure between 100 and 115 mm Hg--mean value 105 mm Hg) were randomised into 3 groups with different target blood pressures (90 mm Hg, 85 mm Hg, 80 mm Hg). The basic treatment was with Felodipin (5 mg q. d.): if the target pressure was not achieved, further steps were initiated: either ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were added, in a third step the Felodipindose was increased to 100 mg and in a further step the doses of ACE-inhibitors or -blockers were doubled. If target pressure was still not achieved, a diuretic was added. Furthermore half of the patients in all groups received either placebo or 75 mg acetyl-salicylic acid. To prevent cardiovascular events the best benefit was shown, when a diastolic pressure of 82.6 mm Hg was reached. Acetyl-salicylic acid showed a further benefit in preventing myocardial infarction, but not in preventing strokes.", 
    "36": "Despite considerable progress in immunosuppression, the incidence of chronic renal allograft rejection has not decreased. Recent studies have revealed that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition ameliorates graft arteriosclerosis, glomerulosclerosis, and tubular atrophy. Moreover, it decreases systemic and glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure in a rat kidney allograft model. We evaluated the effects of the ACE inhibitor enalapril on cytokine and growth factor expression in chronically rejecting rat kidney allografts.",

    "40": "Angiogenesis is the formation of new capillaries from preexisting vessels by migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, which produce a cellular signaling messenger, nitric oxide (NO). The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of exogenous NO donors on angiogenesis by using a novel crystalline NO donor, S-nitrosocaptopril. The characteristic X-ray diffraction pattern of S-nitrosocaptopril was demonstrated for the first time. On primary capillary endothelial cells pretreated with vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF), S-nitrosocaptopril (1-500 microM), but not captopril, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of endothelial proliferation. On chick embryos of entire living eggs, gelatin sponges adsorbed with VEGF were implanted on the embryo chorioallantoic membrane to promote vascular growth activity within the sponges. Addition of S-nitrosocaptopril crystals (0.1 mg) to the gelatin sponges markedly reduced vascular density around the sponges, whereas captopril did not inhibit neovascularization. The vascular hemoglobin content surrounding each of the gelatin sponges was determined as a confirmatory test. S-nitrosocaptopril, but not captopril, significantly decreased the hemoglobin content of the embryo tissues immediately surrounding the gelatin sponges. In conclusion, S-nitrosocaptopril exerts an inhibitory effect on angiogenesis. This newly discovered function of S-nitrosocaptopril appears to be governed by distinct structural NO moiety.", 
    "41": "Contrast-induced nephrotoxicity is an important cause of hospital-acquired acute renal insufficiency. Different modalities have been used to prevent contrast induced-nephrotoxicity namely saline infusion, mannitol, furosemide, calcium channel blockers, atrial natriuretic factor and dopamine infusion with variable success. The possible role of medullary ischaemia mediated by renin angiotensin system in genesis of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity prompted us to investigate the role of captopril (a sulfhydryl group containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) in its prevention. Seventy-one patients of diabetes mellitus undergoing coronary angiography were included in the study. Patients randomised to receive captopril, received the drug in a dose of 25 mg thrice a day for three days, starting one hour prior to angiography while the patients in the control group underwent angiography in a routine manner without receiving captopril. Following angiography, patients in the control group developed a significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, as compared to those who received captopril. Contrast-induced nephrotoxicity (i.e. a rise of 0.5 mg/dL in serum creatinine) developed in 29 percent of the control group. Administration of captopril reduced the risk of development of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity by 79 percent. Glomerular filtration rate as measured by Tc DTPA renal scanning prior to and 24-72 hours following angiography demonstrated a mean fall of 9.6 ml/min in the control group while those in the captopril group had a mean increase of 13 ml/min in glomerular filtration rate. We conclude that abnormalities of renal perfusion possibly mediated by renin angiotensin system are responsible for development of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, offers protection against development of contrast-induced nephrotoxicity.", 
    "42": "The combination therapy with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonists, or calcium channel antagonists may exert more beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases than monotherapy. Perindopril, candesartan cilexetil, or amlodipine alone or the combination of low doses of each agent was administered orally to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) for 4 weeks to compare the hypotensive or cardiovascular effects. Although perindopril (2 mg/kg), candesartan cilexetil (2 mg/kg), or amlodipine (3 mg/kg) alone caused comparable hypotensive effects in SHRSP, monotherapy with perindopril or candesartan decreased left ventricular (LV) weight; mRNA levels for atrial natriuretic factor, skeletal alpha-actin, and collagen types I and III; and aortic weight and platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor tyrosine phosphorylation to a greater extent than monotherapy with amlodipine. Although monotherapy with a low dose (0.2 mg/kg) of perindopril or candesartan cilexetil did not significantly reduce the LV mRNA levels and aortic platelet-derived growth factor-beta receptor phosphorylation of the SHRSP, combination therapy at such a low dose normalized these parameters more potently than the use of amlodipine (3 mg/kg) alone. Although perindopril or candesartan cilexetil alone at 0.05 mg/kg did not decrease the blood pressure of the SHRSP, such a low dose of combination therapy decreased LV weight and atrial natriuretic factor mRNA levels of the SHRSP to a greater extent than amlodipine alone or amlodipine combined with perindopril or candesartan cilexetil. Our results provide evidence that suggests the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an AT(1) receptor antagonist may be more effective in the treatment of cardiac and vascular diseases than the combination of a calcium channel blocker with an ACE inhibitor or an AT(1) receptor antagonist or monotherapy with each agent.", 
    "43": "To assess the importance for vasoconstriction of in situ angiotensin (Ang) II generation, as opposed to Ang II delivery via the circulation, we determined forearm vasoconstriction in response to Ang I (0.1 to 10 ng. kg(-1). min(-1)) and Ang II (0.1 to 5 ng. kg(-1). min(-1)) in 14 normotensive male volunteers (age 18 to 67 years). Changes in forearm blood flow (FBF) were registered with venous occlusion plethysmography. Arterial and venous blood samples were collected under steady-state conditions to quantify forearm fractional Ang I-to-II conversion. Ang I and II exerted the same maximal effect (mean+/-SEM 71+/-4% and 75+/-4% decrease in FBF, respectively), with similar potencies (mean EC(50) [range] 5.6 [0.30 to 12.0] nmol/L for Ang I and 3.6 [0.37 to 7.1] nmol/L for Ang II). Forearm fractional Ang I-to-II conversion was 36% (range 18% to 57%). The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalaprilat (80 ng. kg(-1). min(-1)) inhibited the contractile effects of Ang I and reduced fractional conversion to 1% (0.1% to 8%), thereby excluding a role for Ang I-to-II converting enzymes other than ACE (eg, chymase). The Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist losartan (3 mg. kg(-1). min(-1)) inhibited the vasoconstrictor effects of Ang II. In conclusion, the similar potencies of Ang I and II in the forearm, combined with the fact that only one third of arterially delivered Ang I is converted to Ang II, suggest that in situ-generated Ang II is more important for vasoconstriction than circulating Ang II. Local Ang II generation in the forearm depends on ACE exclusively and results in vasoconstriction via Ang II type 1 receptors.", 
    "44": "An adenine/cytosine (A/C) base substitution at position 1166 in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) gene is associated with the incidence of essential hypertension and increased coronary artery vasoconstriction. However, it is still unknown whether this polymorphism is associated with a difference in angiotensin II responsiveness. Therefore, we assessed whether the AT(1)R polymorphism is associated with different responses to angiotensin II in isolated human arteries. Furthermore, we evaluated whether inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system modifies the effect of the AT(1)R polymorphism. One hundred twelve patients who were undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery were prospectively randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor or a placebo for 1 week before surgery. Excess segments of the internal mammary artery were exposed to angiotensin II (0.1 nmol/L to 1 micromol/L) and KCl (60 mmol/L) in organ bath experiments. Patients homozygous for the C allele (n=17) had significantly greater angiotensin II responses (percentage of this maximal KCl-induced response) than did patients genotyped with AA+AC (n=95, P<0.05). Although ACE inhibition increased the response to angiotensin II, the difference in the response to angiotensin II, between CC and AA+AC patients remained intact in ACE inhibitor-treated patients. These results indicate increased responses to angiotensin II in patients with the CC genotype. The mechanism is preserved during ACE inhibition, which in itself also increased the response to angiotensin II. This reveals that the A1166C polymorphism may be in linkage disequilibrium with a functional mutation that alters angiotensin II responsiveness, which may explain the described relation between this polymorphism and cardiovascular abnormalities.", 
    "45": "In order to examine the safety of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in dogs with impaired renal excretion route, benazepril was administered orally, and plasma concentrations of benazeprilat, the active metabolite of benazepril, were determined in dogs with renal mass reduction (1/4th kidney) created by right-side nephrectomy and ligation of branches of the left renal arteries. Five dogs were administered benazepril orally at a given dose (0.5 mg/kg body weight) and 4 other dogs received 20 times that dose (10 mg/kg body weight) once daily for 15 consecutive days before (intact kidney period) and after (1/4th kidney period) creation of kidney impairment. Six control dogs received surgical treatment, but no drug. After creating a 1/4th kidney, plasma urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations increased to approximately 30 mg/dl and 2.0 mg/dl, respectively, and renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate decreased to 37% and 30% of pre-treatment values, respectively. However, these parameters did not change significantly during the 1/4th kidney period both in the 0.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups. In the 0.5 mg/kg group, plasma benazeprilat concentrations increased to approximately 20 ng/ml to 340 ng/ml 2 hr after each administration, and there were no significant differences between the plasma benazeprilat concentrations during the intact and 1/4th kidney periods. In the 10 mg/kg group, plasma benazeprilat concentrations varied in the individual dog, but did not increase with the days of administration, and were not significantly different on each administration day between the intact and 1/4th kidney periods in either dose group. The AUCs(0-24) of plasma benazeprilat concentrations determined on the 15th administration day were not different between the intact and 1/4th kidney periods in dogs of either dose group. Plasma ACE activities decreased after drug administration in dogs of both groups. Benazepril seemed to have a high safety, and the adjustment of dosage regimen might not be needed in dogs with mild to moderate renal function impairment because the drug was excreted both from the kidneys and liver.", 
    "46": "Treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, has been shown to normalize increased dihydropyridine sensitivity and impaired potassium relaxation, characteristic features of arterial smooth muscle in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and also reduce the concentration of plasma digoxin-like immunoreactivity in these animals. However, whether angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy can beneficially influence these variables is not known. Therefore, we compared the effects of 10-week losartan and enalapril treatments (15 and 4 mg/kg/day, respectively) on functional responses of mesenteric arterial rings in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Both losartan and enalapril normalized blood pressure, cardiac mass, and media to lumen ratio without significantly changing the media cross-sectional area in the mesenteric artery of spontaneously hypertensive rats (i.e. induced outward remodelling). The inhibitory effect of the calcium entry blocker nifedipine on calcium-evoked contractions was similar and less marked in arterial preparations from Wistar-Kyoto rats and losartan- and enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats than in those from untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats. Furthermore, the relaxations of arterial rings induced by the return of potassium to the organ bath (upon precontractions elicited by potassium-free solution) were used to evaluate the function of vascular Na+,K+-ATPase. The rate of potassium relaxation was faster in losartan- and enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats and all Wistar-Kyoto groups than in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats, and the response was effectively inhibited by the sodium pump inhibitor ouabain. Both treatments especially augmented the ouabain-sensitive part of the potassium-relaxation in spontaneously hypertensive rats, indicating the involvement of the sodium pump in this response. However, no significant changes in plasma digoxin-like immunoreactivity were observed. In conclusion, the outward remodelling following long-term AT1-receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in spontaneously hypertensive rats was associated with normalization of the increased dihydropyridine sensitivity of arteries. Both losartan and enalapril treatments also augmented arterial potassium relaxation in spontaneously hypertensive rats, suggesting enhanced function of Na+,K+-ATPase, but this effect could not be attributed to changes in circulating sodium pump inhibitor concentration.",

    "50": "Using the anatomic, diagnostic protocol, the cause of chronic cough can be determined 88% to 100% of the time, leading to specific therapy with success rates of 84% to 98%. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), along with postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS) and asthma, is one of the three most common causes of chronic cough in all age groups. When GERD is the cause of chronic cough, there may be no gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms up to 75% of the time, and, in these cases, the term \"silent GERD\" is used. The most sensitive and specific test for GERD is 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. In interpreting this test, it is essential not only to evaluate the duration and frequency of the reflux episodes but also to determine the temporal relationship between reflux and cough events. Patients with normal standard reflux parameters still may have reflux diagnosed as the likely cause of cough if a temporal relationship exists. The definitive diagnosis of cough resulting from GERD can only be made if cough goes away with antireflux therapy. When 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring cannot be done, an empiric trial of antireflux medical therapy is appropriate when GERD is a likely cause of chronic cough. It is likely in the following settings: patients with prominent GI symptoms consistent with GERD and/or those with no GI complaints and normal chest x-rays, who are not taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and who are not smoking, and in whom asthma and PNDS have been excluded. However, if empiric treatment fails, it cannot be assumed that GERD has been ruled out as a cause of chronic cough; rather, objective investigation for GERD is recommended, because the empiric therapy may not have been intensive enough or it may have failed. In treating patients with chronic cough resulting from GERD, cough has been reported to resolve with medical therapy 70% to 100% of the time. Mean time to recovery may take as long as 161 to 179 days, and patients may not start to get better for 2 to 3 months. In patients who fail to respond to maximal medical therapy, antireflux surgery can be successful.", 
    "51": "There is recent evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduces postischemic injury and angiotensin II receptor inhibition may have similar effects. We therefore further characterized the role of ACE- vs. AT1-receptor inhibition on cell injury and temporal association of leukocyte endothelial interaction in response to ischemia-reperfusion. A combined in vivo and in vitro study comparing the ACE inhibitor enalapril and the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan was performed. The extent and temporal correlation of cellular damage (propidium-iodide staining), microvascular perfusion failure and leukocyte-endothelial interaction (leukocyte adherence) were investigated by means of intravital microscopy, after the application of hemodynamically ineffective doses of enalapril and losartan (5 mg/kg). A hamster dorsal skinfold model with a 4-h tourniquet ischemia was used. In vitro, the effect of enalapril and losartan on polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) adherence, as well as adhesion molecule expression (ICAM-1, VCAM-1), on hypoxia- or IL-1beta-stimulated endothelial cells (HUVEC) was assessed using a PMN-adhesion assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Ischemia-reperfusion responses revealed a biphasic pattern, comprised of an early phase (30 min) of acute cellular damage and microvascular perfusion failure, followed by a late increase (240 min) in leukocyte adherence in vivo. Enalapril significantly reduced early cellular damage, microvascular perfusion failure, and leukocyte adherence in response to ischemia-reperfusion. Conversely, AT1 receptor inhibition with losartan proved to be ineffective at attenuating postischemic microcirculatory disorders (leukocyte-endothelial interactions, microvascular perfusion failure) and aggravated cellular injury. In vitro, enalapril reduced PMN adherence and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression, while losartan was ineffective in the same respect. Following ischemia-reperfusion injury, ACE- versus AT1-receptor inhibition induce differential effects concerning the extent and temporal association of cell injury and leukocyte-endothelial interaction. The use of enalapril combines the beneficial effects of preventing cell and vascular injury immediately after reperfusion, with a delayed inhibition of the inflammatory response. Since the AT1-receptor inhibitor losartan did not mimic effects obtained with ACE inhibition, it is conceivable that the responses in ischemia-reperfusion are mediated by a non-angiotensin II-AT1 receptor-dependent mechanism.",

The bovine whey proteins alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin were hydrolysed with pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, pancreatin, elastase or carboxypeptidase alone and in combination. The total hydrolysates were fractionated in a two step ultrafiltration process, first with a 30 kDa membrane and then with a 1 kDa membrane. Inhibition of ACE was analysed spectrophotometrically. The peptides were isolated by chromatography and identified by mass and sequencing analysis. The most potent inhibitory peptides were synthesized by the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl solid phase method. Inhibition of ACE was observed after hydrolysis with trypsin alone, and with an enzyme combination containing pepsin, trypsin and chymotrypsin. Whey protein digests gave a 50% inhibition (IC50) of ACE activity at concentration ranges within 345-1733 micrograms/ml. The IC50 values for the 1-30 kDa fractions ranged from 485 to 1134 micrograms/ml and for the < 1 kDa fraction from 109 to 837 mg/ml. Several ACE-inhibitory peptides were isolated from the hydrolysates by reversed-phase chromatography, and the potencies of the purified peptide fractions had IC50 values of 77-1062 microM. The ACE-inhibitory peptides identified were alpha-lactalbumin fractions (50-52), (99-108) and (104-108) and beta-lactoglobulin fractions (22-25), (32-40), (81-83), (94-100), (106-111) and (142-146).",

    "72": "Cardiac remodeling is generally accepted as a determinant of the clinical course of heart failure (HF). Defined as genome expression resulting in molecular, cellular and interstitial changes and manifested clinically as changes in size, shape and function of the heart resulting from cardiac load or injury, cardiac remodeling is influenced by hemodynamic load, neurohormonal activation and other factors still under investigation. Although patients with major remodeling demonstrate progressive worsening of cardiac function, slowing or reversing remodeling has only recently become a goal of HF therapy. Mechanisms other than remodeling can also influence the course of heart disease, and disease progression may occur in other ways in the absence of cardiac remodeling. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume and ejection fraction data provide support for the beneficial effects of therapeutic agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the remodeling process. These agents also provide benefits in terms of morbidity and mortality. Although measurement of ejection fraction can reliably guide initiation of treatment in HF, opinions differ regarding the value of ejection fraction data in guiding ongoing therapy. The role of echocardiography or radionuclide imaging in the management and monitoring of HF is as yet unclear. To fully appreciate the potential benefits of HF therapies, clinicians should understand the relationship between remodeling and HF progression. Their patients may then, in turn, acquire an improved understanding of their disease and the treatments they are given.",

In order to assess ACE inhibitor use in patients with heart failure in a teaching hospital and any differences between specialties we studied all patients in the Western Infirmary of Glasgow between 1 April and 1 October 1996 with an echocardiogram showing moderate or severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction (n = 236). We found that most patients were on an ACE inhibitor (66%), 12% had been tried but found to be intolerant, 10% had not been tried because of a contraindication, but 12% had not been tried despite no contraindication. Of those on treatment, 58% were on a dose used in a major survival study (38% of all patients). Most patients were treated by a cardiologist (64%). Of these, more were on an ACE inhibitor (77% vs 53%, p < 0.01), fewer had been tried but found intolerant (11% vs 18%), and fewer had never been tried (11% vs 29%, p < 0.01), irrespective of whether they had a contraindication (5% vs 18%, p < 0.01) or not (6% vs 12%). More were on a dose used in a major survival study (48% vs 31%, p < 0.05). We conclude that, despite improvements over time, ACE inhibitors are still under-used, sometimes without good reason. There are also differences in the use of ACE inhibitors between cardiologists and generalists which may affect outcome, and could affect resource utilisation.", 
    "79": "Although fatty acid metabolism is reportedly impaired in myocardial hypertrophy, it is unclear whether the antihypertensive drugs are associated with improved fatty acid metabolism. In order to evaluate the effects of antihypertensive drugs on fatty acid metabolism and myocardial perfusion, the simultaneous uptake of iodine-125(125I)-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) and thallium-201 (Tl) were measured in 3 groups of rats: (1) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) without treatment (SHR-N), (2) SHR chronically treated with captopril (SHR-C), and (3) SHR chronically treated with hydralazine (SHR-H). Captopril and hydralazine were administered to their respective groups for 3 weeks from 12 weeks of age. The hearts were removed 10 min after simultaneous intravenous injections of BMIPP and Tl and the 125I and 201Tl counts were measured to calculate the uptake ratio. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) in SHR-N was 222+/-10 mm Hg, whereas the SHR-C and SHR-H groups showed significant SBP reduction (156+/-11, and 158+/-10 mm Hg, respectively) (p<0.01 each). The heart/bodyweight ratio was significantly lower in SHR-C (2.48+/-0.09) than in SHR-N (2.74+/-0.11) (p<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in the heart/bodyweight ratio between SHR-N and SHR-H (2.65+/-0.09). The ratio of BMIPP uptake to Tl uptake (BMIPP/Tl) was significantly higher in SHR-C (0.71+/-0.13) than in SHR-N (0.50+/-0.09) (p<0.05). However, BMIPP/Tl in SHR-H (0.53+/-0.09) was similar to that in SHR-N. These results suggest that captopril improves fatty acid metabolism in the hypertrophied ventricle in SHR. The metabolic alterations may improve with left ventricular hypertrophy regression but are not effected by the reduction of blood pressure only.", 
    "80": "Beta-blocker therapy has been shown to improve cardiac function and prognosis in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, whether beta-blockers reduce severe ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death has not been clarified. The present study was designed to investigate the effects of beta-blockers on non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden cardiac death in patients with DCM. Sixty-five patients with DCM treated with diuretics, digitalis and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were assigned to receive beta-blockers (n = 33) or not (n = 32). Mean follow-up was 53+/-30 months. The echocardiographic indices of cardiac function, the incidence of non-sustained VT on Holter monitoring electrocardiograms, and sudden cardiac death rate were compared between the 2 groups. Comparable improvement in cardiac function on echocardiograms was found in the 2 treatment groups. The patient group treated with beta-blockers showed a significant reduction in the prevalence of VT (from 43 to 15%, p<0.05) and the development of new episodes of VT (5 vs. 16%) compared to the group without beta-blockers. The sudden cardiac death rate did not differ between the 2 groups.

    "82": "The paracrine renin-angiotensin-system (RAS) is increasingly recognized to play an important role in the regulation of both, regional vascular tone and regional glucose metabolism. To date, however, a selective investigation of paracrine RAS effects in an in vivo clinical setting was beyond technical reach. We here set out to selectively study the metabolic effects of paracrine RAS inhibition at different levels in healthy volunteers (n = 8). For this purpose bradykinin, enalaprilate and losartan were administered locally to the interstitial space fluid in skeletal muscle by means of reverse microdialysis and transcapillary glucose transport was measured simultaneously. During reverse microdialysis with bradykinin and enalaprilate a significant decrease in arterial-interstitial-gradient for glucose (AIG(glu)) was observed (from 1.49 +/- 0.08 mM to 0.12 +/- 0.63 mM (p = 0.018) for bradykinin and from 1.5 +/- 0.07 mM to 0.24 +/- 0.67 mM (p = 0.043) for enalaprilate). In contrast, losartan had no effect on AIG(glu). The changes in transcapillary glucose transport during bradykinin and enalaprilate administration were accompanied by significant increases in interstitial lactate levels which was most pronounced for bradykinin (from 0.14 +/- 0.01 mM to 0.40 +/- 0.07 mM, p = 0.018). We conclude that paracrine angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibition but not angiotensin II (AT-II) receptor blockade decreases AIG(glu) and facilitates transcapillary glucose transport due to an increase in interstitial bradykinin concentration. These results support the concept that blood pressure control with ACE-inhibitors but not with AT-II-receptor-antagonists has beneficial long term metabolic consequences in hypertensive, hyperinsulinemic subjects.", 
    "83": "Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the leading cause of death around the globe. Advances in the field of cardiology have identified several effective treatments that have lead to decrease in mortality from this cause over the past 3 decades. The purpose of this article is to review the existing literature in regards to secondary prevention after acute MI. A search of MEDLINE through August of 1999 was carried out to identify any available publications on secondary prevention after MI. Evidence on the use of both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions that was shown to be effective in improving morbidity and mortality was sought. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with acute MI are made based on existing evidence. Betablockers, aspirin and lipid-lowering agents for patients with low density lipoprotein-cholesterol > 130 mg% should be used for all patients following a MI. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are indicated for patients with congestive heart failure and/or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and are likely protective in most patients. Calcium channel blockers (Verapamil and Diltiazem) are indicated as second-line therapy for patients who have contraindications or are intolerant to betablockers. The routine prophylactic use of antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress ventricular ectopic beats should be avoided. Recommendations regarding diet, smoking cessation and achievement of ideal body weight should be an integral part of patient management. Referral for outpatient rehabilitation should also be strongly encouraged. Finally, adequate control of blood pressure and diabetes cannot be overemphasized. Adherence to these goals in patients with acute MI will lead to better long-term outcomes and reduction in cardiac death, recurrent MI, stroke, and need for coronary revascularization.", 
    "84": "We examined the renal responsiveness to ACE inhibitor in IgA nephropathy (IgAN) patients according to the grouping of ACE gene polymorphism. Sixty one patients diagnosed as IgAN by renal biopsy and prescribed with ACE inhibitors were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and PCR was performed. The I/D polymorphism was determined by the presence of the 287 bp fragment in intron 16 of chromosome 17. During the follow-up period (mean; 44.6 months, median: 44.5 months, 5 to 113 months), the blood pressure of 61 patients was controlled below 130/80 mmHg. The renal responsiveness was determined by the degree of changes of proteinuria at 12 months after initiation of ACE inhibitors and by the slope of reciprocal variation of the serum creatinine against follow-up duration \u00bf(1/Cr2-1/Cr1)/durations\u00bf. The distribution of the II, ID and DD genotype among 61 patients was 21, 16 and 24 patients, respectively. There were no differences among three genotypes in age, sex, the number of patients with initial blood pressure over 140/90 mmHg, initial serum creatinine level, the number of patients with initial azotemia (> 1.4 mg/dL) and with initial 24-hr proteinuria amount over 2.0 g. Significant anti-proteinuric effect of ACE inhibitor was found in IgAN (p = 0.001), but no significant difference was found among genotypes. Significant difference (p = 0.011) was noticed between II type and DD type in the slope of reciprocal variation of the serum creatinine against follow-up duration. In conclusion, efficacy of ACE inhibitors on renal function preservation in IgAN was more pronounced in DD genotype than II genotype.", 
    "85": "An 86-year-old man on whom a transurethral resection of prostate was performed under spinal anaesthesia developed profound bradycardia and hypotension with disturbance of consciousness during transfer to the recovery room. Initial treatment with atropine produced rapid improvement in cardiovascular and cerebral function. A further hypotensive episode (without bradycardia) occurred approximately 1 h later but responded rapidly to methoxamine. The patient made a full recovery during an overnight stay on the High Dependency Unit. Possible mechanisms for this event are discussed, with the proposal that the concomitant administration of captopril and the relative unavailability of Angiotensin II may have significantly contributed to the problem.", 
    "86": "The effect of enalapril and captopril on total glutathione content (GSSG + GSH) and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GPx) and glutathione reductase (GSSG-Rd) activities was investigated in mouse tissues. CF-1 mice (4-mo-old females) received water containing enalapril (20 mg/l) or captopril (50 mg/l) for 11 wk. Enalapril increased GSSG + GSH content (P < 0.05) in erythrocytes (147%), brain (112%), and lung (67%), and captopril increased GSSG + GSH content in erythrocytes (190%) and brain (132%). Enalapril enhanced Se-GPx activity in kidney cortex (42%) and kidney medulla (23%) and captopril in kidney cortex (30%). GSSG-Rd activity was enhanced by enalapril in erythrocytes (21%), brain (21%), liver (18%), and kidney cortex (53%) and by captopril in erythrocytes (25%), brain (19%), and liver (34%). In vitro erythrocyte oxidant stress was evaluated by thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) production (control 365 +/- 11, enalapril 221 +/- 26, captopril 206 +/- 17 nmol TBARS x g Hb(-1) x h(-1); both P < 0.05 vs. control) and phenylhydrazine-induced methemoglobin (MetHb) formation (control 66.5 +/- 3.5, enalapril 52.9 +/- 0.4, captopril: 56.4 +/- 2.9 micromol MetHb/g Hb; both P < 0.05 vs. control). Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor treatments were associated with increased nitric oxide production, as assessed by plasma NO-(3) + NO-(2) level determination (control 9.22 +/- 0.64, enalapril 13.7 +/- 1.9, captopril 17.3 +/- 3.0 micromol NO-(3) + NO-(2)/l plasma; both P < 0.05 vs. control). These findings support our previous reports on the enalapril- and captopril-induced enhancement of endogenous antioxidant defenses and include new data on glutathione-dependent defenses, thus furthering current knowledge on the association of ACE inhibition and antioxidants.", 
    "87": "The incidence of diabetes and its complications is increasing to staggering proportions. Presently the WHO estimates an overall prevalence of 130 million, but by 2025 there will be 300 million individuals with diabetes mellitus. The incidence of diabetic neuropathy approaches 50% in most diabetic populations; there is no treatment, and its consequences in the form of foot ulceration and amputation are financially punishing for health care providers. Attempts to develop treatments have faltered for want of an understanding of the aetiology of diabetic neuropathy. As a consequence, 1999 saw the demise of two further compounds: recombinant growth factor by Roche-Genentech and the aldose reductase inhibitor zopolrestat, by Pfizer, both had reached phase III clinical trials. They joined an impressive list of at least 30 other compounds which have reached phase III clinical trials and failed to establish efficacy. The need to establish a viable treatment for human diabetic neuropathy is absolutely paramount. To provide a rational answer as to whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can prevent human diabetic neuropathy, two major issues need addressing: 1) Does vascular dysfunction cause human diabetic neuropathy? 2) Can ACE inhibitors ameliorate diabetic vascular dysfunction and hence neuropathy? Epidemiological studies support a strong association between neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy. Microangiopathy is deemed as the root cause of both nephropathy, and retinopathy and mounting evidence provides support for a vascular basis of diabetic neuropathy. ACE inhibitors appear to correct many of the abnormalities associated with the vascular dysfunction found in diabetes. Thus effective ACE inhibition impacts very positively on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ischaemic heart disease, particularly in diabetic patients. ACE inhibition also prevents the development and progression of incipient and established diabetic nephropathy and delays progression of background retinopathy. Quinapril improves measures of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Our recent study has demonstrated a significant improvement in peripheral neuropathy following 12 months of treatment with the ACE inhibitor trandolapril.", 
    "88": "Despite many recent advances, heart failure continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Once a patient is identified and evaluated as having heart failure, nonpharmacologic therapies such as a dietary restrictions, lifestyle changes, exercise strategies, and patient education are initiated as well as pharmacologic therapy. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digoxin all are considered traditional therapy in the management of chronic heart failure associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The role of newer therapies such as beta-blockers and angiotensin II receptor antagonists in the treatment of heart failure is in the process of being defined. Furthermore, new data is appearing concerning calcium channel blockers, spironolactone, and combinations of the various agents. Appropriate use of the traditional agents accompanied by a through understanding of the newer therapies and their roles is essential to the continued reduction of the morbidity and mortality associated with heart failure.", 
    "89": "Hypertension is currently defined in terms of levels of blood pressure associated with increased cardiovascular risk. A cut-off of 140/90 mm Hg is accepted as a threshold level above which treatment should at least be considered. This would give a prevalence of hypertension of about 20% of the adult population in most developed countries. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and renal impairment. Hypertension results from the complex interaction of genetic factors and environmental influences. Many of the genetic factors remain to be discovered, but environmental influences such as salt intake, diet and alcohol form the basis of nonpharmacological methods of blood pressure reduction. Investigation of the individual hypertensive patient aims to identify possible secondary causes of hypertension and also to assess the individual's overall cardiovascular risk, which determines the need for prompt and aggressive therapy. Cardiovascular risk can be determined from (i) target organ damage to the eyes, heart and kidneys; (ii) other medical conditions associated with increased risk; and (iii) lifestyle factors such as obesity and smoking. Secondary causes of hypertension are individually rare. Screening tests should be initially simple, with more expensive and invasive tests reserved for those in whom a secondary cause is suspected or who have atypical features to their presentation. The main determinants of blood pressure are cardiac output and peripheral resistance. The typical haemodynamic finding in patients with established hypertension is of normal cardiac output and increased peripheral resistance. Treatment of hypertension should initially use nonpharmacological methods. Selection of initial drug therapy should be based upon the strength of evidence for reduction of cardiovascular mortality in controlled clinical trials, and should also take into account coexisting medical conditions that favour or limit the usefulness of any given drug. Given this approach, it would be reasonable to use a thiazide diuretic and/or a beta-blocker as first-line therapy unless there are indications to the contrary. Individual response to given drug classes is highly variable and is related to the underlying variability in the abnormal pathophysiology. There are data to suggest that the renin-angiotensin system is more important in young patients. The targeting of this system in patients under the age of 50 years with a beta-blocker (or ACE inhibitor), and the use of a thiazide diuretic (or calcium antagonist) in patients over 50 years, may enable blood pressure to be controlled more quickly.", 
    "90": "We conducted a MEDLINE search from January 1966-March 1999 to obtain information on clinical trials of treatment of pediatric hypertension. An article was selected for review if it described a randomized or nonrandomized study; randomized studies were given priority. Case reports were considered when studies were unavailable. Review articles were useful in identifying references. According to data we collected, hypertension is present in 1-3% of the pediatric population. Nonpharmacologic treatment may be effective initially in those with mild to moderate disease or as an adjunct to drug therapy. Drugs for treatment of chronic hypertension include calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and beta-blockers. Patient and drug characteristics determine therapy. Intravenous labetalol, nicardipine, and nitroprusside are effective for treating hypertensive emergencies.", 
    "91": "Over the past 4 years, six angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) were approved for treating essential hypertension. They differ with respect to dosing, metabolism, elimination, clinical efficacy, and investigational applications. Candesartan cilexetil is the only prodrug among the agents. Losartan is distinguished from other ARBs by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4- and CYP2C9-mediated biotransformation to its active metabolite EXP-3174. No ARB requires dosage adjustment for renal impairment, but the initial dose of losartan should be reduced 50% in hepatically impaired patients. None of the drugs is significantly cleared by hemodialysis. Completion of continuing trials will elucidate the drugs' role in treating heart failure, cerebral stroke, and myocardial infarction.", 
    "92": "Angiotensin II, through its effects at the angiotensin-type 1 receptor, elevates arterial pressure and exacerbates hypertensive heart disease. Alterations in coronary hemodynamics, including reductions in coronary blood flow and flow reserve promotes coronary insufficiency and contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk associated with these conditions. In spontaneously hypertensive rats, coronary flow reserve, the difference between basal coronary blood flow and the flow achieved during maximal coronary vasodilation achieved by dipyridimole, was increased to a greater extent after treatment for 3 months with an angiotensin II receptor blocker as compared with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor. The combination of the two agents, in equidepressor doses, almost restored coronary flow reserve to levels seen in normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats. This finding suggests a possible advantage of combination angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy in patients with hypertension and hypertensive heart disease.", 
    "93": "The renin-angiotensin system plays a central role in the regulation of blood pressure through its primary effector hormone angiotensin II. Studies conducted nearly 30 years ago with peptidic angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) suggested that disruption of the renin-angiotensin system offered considerable promise for the treatment of hypertension as well as heart failure. This promise was initially realized with the advent of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and more recently with nonpeptidic ARB that selectively antagonize the AT1-angiotensin receptor subtype. The potent and long-acting agent candesartan cilexetil illustrates how these new ARB fulfill the promises suggested by the early studies. Candesartan cilexetil provides a clinically relevant, dose-dependent reduction in diastolic and systolic blood pressure at doses of 4 to 16 mg once daily in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Recent studies suggest that further blood pressure lowering is obtained with a 32-mg once daily dose. In comparative clinical trials, 8 mg of candesartan cilexetil and 10 to 20 mg of enalapril provided comparable antihypertensive effects. The safety and tolerability profile of candesartan cilexetil is comparable to placebo. Notably, this agent does not produce the dry, nonproductive cough that often limits use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nor does it cause side effects that limit other antihypertensive drug classes. On the basis of the results of initial clinical studies, ARB also possess cardioprotective and renoprotective properties that promise to expand the role that these new agents will play in treating cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "94": "The deletion (D) allele of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is associated with high ACE levels. Subjects homozygous for the D allele should therefore exhibit enhanced angiotensin I-induced vasoconstrictor responses and diminished bradykinin-induced vasodilator responses as compared with subjects homozygous for the insertion (I) allele. In eight II and eight DD normotensive male subjects, angiotensin I, bradykinin, and angiotensin II were infused in the forearm. Changes in forearm blood flow were registered with venous occlusion plethysmography. Blood was sampled to quantify angiotensin I to II conversion. Plasma ACE levels were 60% higher, and DD subjects showed an enhanced response to angiotensin I infusion (p < 0.05). No differences in angiotensin I to II conversion, angiotensin H vasoconstriction, and bradykinin vasorelaxation were found. The ACE-inhibitor enalaprilate inhibited angiotensin I-induced vasoconstriction, but did not significantly affect bradykinin-induced vasodilation. The AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (3,000 ng/kg/min) inhibited angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. In conclusion, subjects with the DD genotype display an enhanced vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin I, which cannot be explained on the basis of a similarly enhanced angiotensin I to II conversion rate or a difference in vascular reactivity. Possibly therefore, differences in angiotensin I to II conversion occur within the vascular wall only, at a site that does not readily equilibrate with blood plasma.", 
    "95": "Phosphoinositide turnover and protein kinase C (PKC) mediate the signaling of angiotensin II, which plays a pivotal role in ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). To determine whether PKC is activated after MI, rat hearts after MI were subjected to in vitro quantitative autoradiography with [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), which is highly selective for PKC. [3H]PDBu binding in the infarcted area increased significantly compared with the non-infarcted region 7 and 21 days after MI, but not 1 and 3 days and 10 months after MI. [3H]PDBu binding in the noninfarcted area was similar to that in the sham-operated rats. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that abundant macrophages (7 days after MI), fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts (7 and 21 days after MI) occupied the infarcted region. To investigate whether myocardial [3H]PDBu binding is affected by captopril, hearts were subjected to in vitro autoradiography with [3H]PDBu after 1- or 3-week captopril treatment or no treatment. Captopril treatment significantly suppressed [3H]PDBu binding in the infarcted area 3 weeks after MI, but not 1 week after MI nor in the noninfarcted areas. These results suggest that PKC is upregulated during the healing and fibrogenic process after MI and that captopril treatment suppresses the upregulation in the infarcted area.", 
    "96": "The renin angiotensin system (RAS) is now recognized as the body's most powerful hormone system for controlling renal hemodynamics and sodium excretion and, therefore, body fluid volumes and arterial pressure. The discovery of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) was a keystone for the understanding of the significance of the RAS since ACEi proved to be effective in controlling hypertension and heart failure and in preventing the development of the vascular injury of chronic diseases like scleroderma and diabetes mellitus. The success of ACEi stimulated the research into inhibitors of other actors of the RAS like renin or angiotensin receptor antagonists. It is not often realized that the discovery of ACEi owes a great deal to basic research in which the venom of a Brazilian viper, Bothrops Jararaca, was instrumental for the discovery of bradykinin by Rocha e Silva and the bradykinin potentiating factor. This article reviews the contribution of the converting enzyme inhibitors for the demonstration of the relevance of the RAS to several human pathologies.",

    "98": "LVVR was performed in 21 patients (mean age = 65.5 years) with congestive heart failure. Our management strategy was initially based on afterload reduction with sodium nitroprusside, but was later modified to include routine preoperative intra-aortic balloon support, normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, antegrade intermittent warm blood cardioplegia, and postoperative support with phosphodiesterase-III inhibitors. Hemodynamic manipulations are aimed to attain systemic vascular resistance between 600 and 800 dyne/sec per cm(-5) and the lowest mean blood pressure that is able to maintain satisfactory systemic perfusion. Postoperatively, aggressive antifailure medical therapy with a high dose of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, nitrates, and diuretics was initiated early and maintained indefinitely.",

IABP support was used for 59.6+/-9 hours following surgery, and inotropic support for 103+/-12 hours. In our series there were four (19%) in-hospital deaths, two of which were related to heart failure.",

    "101": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of smoking habits on safety of trandolapril assessed by interrogation and by visual analogue scales (VAS). A total of 3402 hypertensive smokers (> or = 1 cigarette/d for at least 6 months) and non-smokers (no smoking or ceased at least 6 months previously) received trandolapril 2 mg/d for 4 weeks. The safety profile of trandolapril was assessed by both interrogation and by VAS. The VAS completed by the patients at D0 and D28 explored the following symptoms: asthenia, nausea, cough, headaches and dizziness. A significant change in cough VAS was previously defined by an at least 19 mm change. VAS analysis was performed on 2840 patients (1296 smokers and 1544 non-smokers), mean age 59 +/- 12 years. Smokers and non-smokers were significantly different for age 56 +/- 12 years vs. 62 +/- 12 years, sex ratio 74 per cent males vs. 45 per cent, history of hypertension 4.5 +/- 6.1 years vs. 5.3 +/- 6.5 years and cough VAS score at D0 35 +/- 26 mm vs. 20 +/- 21 mm. In the total population, 214 adverse events were reported by 177 patients (5.2 per cent). The most frequent adverse events were a cough (2.1 per cent), bronchitis (0.6 per cent), headaches (0.5 per cent), rhinitis (0.4 per cent), nausea (0.4 per cent) and asthenia (0.3 per cent). Cough was reported by 23 smokers (1.5 per cent) and by 49 (2.6 per cent) non-smokers (p = 0.02). In the VAS population, 151 adverse events were reported by 130 patients, 47 smokers (3.6 per cent) and 83 non-smokers (5.4 per cent, p = 0.03). The difference between the two groups was mainly due to a cough: 15 smokers (1.2 per cent) reported a cough vs. 38 non-smokers (2.5 per cent, p = 0.01) and 77 smokers (5.9 per cent) presented a significant change of cough VAS score vs. 124 non-smokers (8.0 per cent, p = 0.03). In this large scale study, 1.9 per cent of patients treated with trandolapril exhibited a cough. Smokers were less likely to present a cough. Use of VAS confirmed this trend.", 
    "102": "Our laboratory previously reported that the end-systolic force-length relationship of the left ventricle provides a better method of evaluating myocardial contractile properties than the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, because it avoids deficiencies of the latter parameter such as dependence of its slope (E(max)) on the volume intercept (V(0)). The slope (E(c)) of the left ventricular end-systolic force-length relationship represents the contractility of functioning myocardium, while its length intercept (L(0)) reflects the length of non-functioning myocardium. However, the effect of regional myocardial ischemia on these parameters, as evaluated by the force-length relationship, remains unknown. To clarify the effects of regional ischemia and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on the myocardium during ischemia-reperfusion, the changes in E(c) and L(0) were determined in anesthetized open-chest dogs. (1) Control group (n=26): Before and after 15 min of complete coronary artery occlusion, as well as after 15 min of reperfusion, left ventricular pressure and volume were simultaneously recorded during inferior vena cava occlusion. The left ventricular force-length relationship was obtained from the pressure and volume of three cylindrical segments of the ventricle, and E(c) and L(0) were calculated. (2) Imidapril group (n=14): Imidaprilat (1 microg/kg/min) was continuously infused from 30 min before ischemia to the end of the experiment, and the same procedures were followed as in the control group. Fourteen out of the 26 dogs (54%) in the control group died of reperfusion-induced ventricular arrhythmias, while only two of the 14 dogs (14%) in the imidapril group did so (P<0.05). In the control group, E(c) was increased during ischemia and remained at the same level after reperfusion. However, E(c) was not altered in the imidapril group. Although L(0) was increased during ischemia and decreased after reperfusion in both groups, the percent increase of L(0) in the imidapril group was significantly smaller than in the control group (8% vs. 32%, P<0.05). With the improvement of these indices, the bradykinin concentration of coronary venous blood increased in the imidapril group (P<0.01). These findings suggest that regional myocardial ischemia increased the average contractility of overall functioning myocardium despite the increased non-functioning myocardium. Moreover, imidapril has a cardioprotective effect against ischemia-reperfusion injury by decreasing infarct size, and through the antiarrhythmic effect and the reversal of increased overall contractility.", 
    "103": "Various studies have reported an inverse association between serum albumin level and incident coronary heart disease (CHD), though biologic mechanisms have not been established. The authors examined the association between serum albumin level and CHD in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort, comprising 14,506 White and African-American middle-aged men and women. The mean albumin level in this population was 3.9 g/dl (standard deviation 0.3). During 5.2 years of follow-up, 470 incident CHD events occurred. The hazard ratio for incident CHD associated with a 1-standard deviation decrease in serum albumin level was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 1.38) after adjustment for age, gender, and ethnicity and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.30) after additional adjustment for covariates related to CHD. Hazard ratios were similar across gender and ethnic groups. However, there was statistically significant effect modification by smoking status, with hazard ratios of 1.01 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.22) among never smokers, 1.09 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.30) among former smokers, and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.54) among current smokers. Further adjustment for factors related to renal disease, nutrition, platelet aggregation, inflammation, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and hemostasis factors attenuated the albumin-CHD relation only slightly. In this study, serum albumin was inversely associated with incident CHD at the baseline examination in current smokers but not in never or former smokers. Albumin level may be a marker of susceptibility to the inflammatory response that results from smoking.", 
    "104": "The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of stroke in a hospital-derived cohort of patients with chronic Chagas' disease. Seventy-nine patients with chronic Chagas' disease were prospectively followed at the Cardiomyopathy Clinic of the Santa Casa Hospital from January 1990 to June 1993 (mean follow up = 17 +/- 12 months). Mean New York Heart Association functional class was 2.42 +/- 1.24. Fifty-six (70%) patients were on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors at maximum tolerated doses, but no patient was on anticoagulation therapy. Atrial fibrillation was detected on the resting ECG in twelve (15%) patients. On echocardiography, mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 49.07 +/- 17.96% and mean left ventricular diastolic dimension 60.12 +/- 10.97 mm; mitral regurgitation was detected in 20 (29%) patients. Left ventricular thrombus was seen in three (4%) patients; all of them were in sinus rhythm and had left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. No thromboembolic event, however, was detected during the follow-up. One patient (1%) had a fatal stroke during the study period; she was in sinus rhythm on the resting ECG, and had mild mitral regurgitation, normal left ventricular function and no intracavitary thrombus on Doppler echocardiography. The prevalence of stroke is low in a hospital-derived cohort of patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to chronic Chagas' disease. Routine prophylactic anticoagulation, therefore, seems not to be warranted.",

After a titration period of at least 10 days, patients who tolerated 50 mg b.i.d., were randomly assigned to receive either the low dose or the high dose of captopril and followed up to 2 years.", 
    "107": "298 patients were included and were followed up for a mean of 12 months. Progression in heart failure seems to be favourably influenced by therapy with high dose in comparison to low dose; a relative difference of 29% in the rates of heart failure worsening was observed between the two doses, 31.5% and 22.4% for low and high dose (p = 0.088), respectively. Treatment with high dose showed also a trend to benefit as compared to low dose in reducing the number of hospitalizations for all causes from 22.4 to 14.5% (p = 0.1) and for congestive heart failure from 14.7 to 7.2% (p = 0.06); moreover, the incidence of fatal and nonfatal cardiac events showed a trend in favour of the high dose of 22% (p = 0.142).

    "109": "The aim of the study was to evaluate a possible progression with time of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels in treated schizophrenia patients. CSF ACE was determined in duplicate by a sensitive inhibitor-binding assay (IBA) from morning CSF samples of 56 acute and chronic in-patients with schizophrenic psychoses diagnosed according to DSM-IV. CSF ACE correlated significantly with length of schizophrenic psychosis (r=0.39, p=0.003). There was also a positive significant correlation between CSF ACE and duration of current psychotic episode (r=0.39, p=0.003) as well as duration of current hospitalization (r=0.66, p<0.001). These significances were maintained even when patients who were not treated with antipsychotics at the time of sampling were excluded. The correlations also remained significant when controlling for current neuroleptic dose in chlorpromazine equivalents. Serum ACE did not correlate with any clinical variable. No significant correlations between serum or CSF ACE and age, diagnostic subgroup, gender, serum ACE, CSF to serum albumin ratios, or neuroleptic dose in chlorpromazine equivalents were detected. The elevation of CSF ACE seemed to be confined to a subgroup of chronic patients with few positive symptoms. Elevated CSF ACE may reflect an increased solubilization of ACE from cell membranes in the central nervous system or constitute an increased expression of the ACE gene in response to some stimuli. This may be a function of treatment or a result of the deteriorating schizophrenic process.", 
    "110": "The effects of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist YM358 on blood pressure were compared to those of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril in one-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (1K1C RHR), two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K1C RHR) and normotensive rats (NTR). Additionally, the local drug actions in peripheral tissues were investigated using isolated mesenteric arteries from these rats. In 2K1C RHR, YM358 and enalapril produced a long-lasting hypotensive effect in a dose-dependent manner. In 1K1C RHR, YM358 (30 mg/kg) also produced an antihypertensive effect, whereas enalapril (30 mg/kg) had no effect. Administration of YM358, but not enalapril, to 1K1C RHR, 2K1C RHR and NTR did not affect heart rate. In isolated mesenteric arteries from 1K1C RHR and 2K1C RHR, angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin I (Ang I) and tetradecapeptide (TDP), a physiologically active renin substrate, produced concentration-dependent vasoconstriction. YM358 (10(-7) M) inhibited the vasoconstricting responses to Ang II, Ang I and TDP in isolated mesenteric arteries. In contrast, enalaprilat (10(-7) M), an active metabolite of enalapril, did not completely inhibit the response to Ang I and TDP. These results indicate that YM358 has higher efficacy than enalapril for the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "111": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the interrelationship of the kinin system, nitric oxide and eicosanoids in the acute phase of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in rabbits. The arthritis was induced in immunized rabbits and the following parameters were evaluated 24 hours later: leukocyte influx (total and differential white cell count), vascular permeability (Evans's blue method), and synovial PMN cell infiltrate. PGE2 and LTB4 (radioimmunoassay) levels were quantified in the synovial fluid. The animals were pre-treated with 20mg/kg/day during 14 days with L-NAME or D-NAME and/or Enalapril (0.12 mg/kg/day-14 days), and/or the B2 antagonist of Bradykinin HOE 140 (0.9 mg/kg). Our results showed that L-NAME was effective in the prevention of AIA with reduction of all Inflammatory parameters analyzed. Enalapril partially reverted the L-NAME anti-inflammatory effects. The simultaneous treatment with HOE 140 abolished this reversion and returned the inflammatory parameters to the levels observed in L-NAME treated animals. Our results suggest that pressoric alterations induced by L-NAME could not account for all its anti-inflammatory action in this model of experimental arthritis. Additionally the contribution of the kinin system in AIA was characterized as well as its interaction with eicosanoids and nitric oxide.",

The absorbance measurement of the formed chelates or of the metal moiety of chelates was used as the basis for the spectrophotometric and atomic absorption spectrometric determinations. The formed complexes have been used as pre-column derivatizing procedure for the HPLC determination of the two drugs. The different experimental conditions were optimized. The calibration graphs were linear over the applicable concentration ranges.

The determination of benazepril hydrochloride in the presence of hydrochlorothiazide was achieved by measuring the second-order derivative signals at 253.6 and 282.6 nm, while the second-order derivative signal at 282.6 nm was measured for the determination of hydrochlorothiazide. The linear dynamic ranges were 14.80-33.80 microg ml(-1) for benazepril hydrochloride and 18.50-42.20 microg ml(-1) for hydrochlorothiazide, the correlation coefficient for the calibration graphs were better than 0.9998, n = 5, the precision (%RSD) was better than 1.43% and the accuracy was satisfactory (Er < 0.99%). The detection limits were found to be 2.46 and 1.57 microg ml(-1) for benazepril hydrochloride and hydrochlorothiazide, respectively.

Serum total cholesterol was increased by the HC diet and was not affected by either anti-hypertensive agent. HDL-cholesterol was similarly decreased in the three HC diet groups. Alacepril, but not amlodipine, completely attenuated the MDA elevation induced by the HC diet. Urinary protein excretion was decreased by the two anti-hypertensive agents at a similar rate. The renal histological injury assessed by the sclerosing score was ameliorated more significantly by alacepril than by amlodipine.", 
    "117": "Both amlodipine and alacepril decreased blood pressure and urinary protein, and ameliorated the renal injury induced by the HC diet in rats. The renal effect of alacepril seems to be mediated by the decrease in oxidative stress as well as by reduction of blood pressure, since alacepril lowered the sclerosing score more than amlodipine and completely attenuated MDA, although the blood pressure reduction by alacepril was less than that by amlodipine.",

DuP753 also prevented the reduction in mRNA; it actually produced a 100% increase in AT2-r mRNA accumulation (P < 0.01 versus baseline).

The development of various types of antihypertensive drugs has not only greatly improved the management of hypertension, but also offered significant methodological sophistication of the pharmacological and pathophysiological sciences. Antihypertensive drugs and related experimental agents have been widely used in pharmaco-logical and pathophysiological research. The beneficial effects of such agents will be illustrated by means of several examples, emphasizing the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and calcium homeostasis as major targets. As pharmacological tools, which are also antihypertensives, we discuss various types of centrally acting antihypertensives, ganglionic and peripheral neuronal blocking agents, alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, renin-inhibitors, angiotensin II-receptor antagonists (AT1-blockers) and calcium antagonists.

Evidence now emerges that angiotensin II exerts actions through the AT2 receptor which are directly opposed to those mediated by the AT1 receptor. This can be exemplified e.g. by mutually antagonizing effects on cell growth. Upregulated by the endogenous agonist itself, as well as by several growth- and differentiating factors in development and tissue injury, the AT2 receptor appears to act as a modulator of complex biological programmes involved in embryonic development, cell differentiation, tissue protection and regeneration, as well as in programmed cell death. Research on the AT2 receptor has thus unveiled hitherto unknown functions of the renin-angiotensin system extending far beyond the classical role of this old hormonal system in cardiovascular control.",

    "149": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition reduces proteinuria in established adriamycin nephrosis. To investigate whether the reduction in proteinuria is due to decreased generation of angiotensin II (AngII) or to decreased degradation of bradykinin, four series of experiments in established adriamycin nephrosis were performed. In the first series, 2 mg/kg lisinopril reduced BP from 117 +/- 4 to 67 +/- 2 mmHg and proteinuria from 335 +/- 66 to 57 +/- 10 mg/24 h after 2 wk of treatment. Subsequent continuous intraperitoneal infusion of AngII (250 ng/kg per min) for 2 wk partially restored proteinuria to 180 +/- 42 mg/24 h, whereas BP increased to 97 +/- 3 mmHg. Subsequent withdrawal of AngII restored the antiproteinuric effects of lisinopril, whereas subsequent withdrawal of lisinopril restored proteinuria to pretreatment values. In the second series, AT1 receptor blockade induced a fall in BP and proteinuria similar to that by lisinopril. In the third series, lisinopril reduced BP from 121 +/- 5 to 68 +/- 2 mmHg and proteinuria from 355 +/- 90 to 101 +/- 10 mg/24 h. Subsequent intraperitoneal infusion of bradykinin antagonist (HOE 140; 1 mg/kg per 24 h) for 2 wk did not affect BP (72 +/- 2 mmHg) or proteinuria (92 +/- 15 mg/24 h). In the fourth series, bradykinin (3 mg/kg per 24 h) was infused for 2 wk to mimic decreased bradykinin breakdown. This did not affect proteinuria, but induced a fall in BP from 114 +/- 3 to 93 +/- 4 mmHg. The BP-lowering effect of exogenous bradykinin was completely reversed by 1 wk infusion of HOE 140 (93 +/- 4 to 113 +/- 4 mmHg), while proteinuria remained unchanged. In conclusion, the antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibition appears to be independent of bradykinin in this model, supporting a main role for reduction of AngII in the antiproteinuric action of ACE inhibition.", 
    "150": "The mechanism(s) by which angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent glomerular membrane loss of permselective function is still not understood. In male MWF rats, which develop spontaneous proteinuria with age, ACE inhibitors prevent proteinuria and increase glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient. These renoprotective effects are not associated with ultrastructural changes of capillary wall components. This study was undertaken to investigate whether ACE inhibitors modulate functional properties of glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and/or of epithelial cells, both of which have been suggested to play a role in the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. The hydraulic and macromolecular permeability of the GBM were determined, by an in vitro filtration system, in untreated or lisinopril-treated rats and in Wistar rats taken as controls. By indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy, glomerular distribution of the tight junction protein zonula occludens- (ZO-1), a component of the slit diaphragm, was also studied. Results document that spontaneous proteinuria in MWF rats develops without significant changes in the permeability of the GBM to water and albumin, or in the ultrastructure of the podocyte foot processes, but is associated with an important alteration in the distribution of ZO-1 at the glomerular level. Lisinopril, which prevented proteinuria, also prevented glomerular redistribution of the protein. Thus, renoprotective effects of ACE inhibitors are not associated with changes in intrinsic functional properties of GBM, or ultrastructural changes of the epithelial cells, but rather with preservation of glomerular ZO-1 distribution and slit diaphragm function, which are essential for maintaining the filtration barrier.",

We reviewed the literature (via MEDLINE) for the past 35 years for beta-blocker-induced asthma, and reexamined potential beta-blocker use in the context of NIH guidelines for asthma classification and management. Because beta-blockers can cause fatal or life-threatening asthma, their use should be avoided in moderate to severe persistent asthmatics. Benefits of low-dose beta(1)-blockers (e.g. atenolol 50 mg daily) may outweigh risks in some patients with mild intermittent or well-controlled mild persistent asthma.

The third one utilizes the reaction of benazepril, after alkaline hydrolysis, with 3-methylbenzothialozone (MBTH) hydrazone where the produced color is measured at 593 nm. The latter method was extended to develop a stability-indicating method for this drug.

We analyzed the types and frequencies of maternal and neonatal complications in 24 IDDM patients with diabetic nephropathy (24 pregnancies), all with preserved to mildly impaired renal function. All patients received treatment with captopril for at least six months prior to planned pregnancy and were maintained under strict glycemic control from at least three months before pregnancy to delivery. A successful pregnancy outcome (live, healthy infant without severe handicaps two years after delivery) was observed in 87.5% of the patients. Preexisting hypertension was the only parameter found to be significantly predictive of an unsuccessful outcome (p = 0.0004). We conclude that in patients with IDDM complicated by diabetic nephropathy, pre-pregnancy captopril treatment combined with strict glycemic control offers a prolonged protective effect against possible renal deterioration and probably improves pregnancy outcome.",

Patients coughed less frequently and with less severe cough with candesartan cilexetil than with enalapril, and similarly with candesartan cilexetil and placebo. Changes in the MSE profile were minor, although candesartan cilexetil had better scores for contentment than placebo (P = .03), and also tended to be associated with better sleep than enalapril (P = .08).

However, very few studies have evaluated whether the beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on these myocardial remodelings are associated with local gene expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and ACE mRNA in the LV. Effects of long term treatment with imidapril, an ACE inhibitor, on gene expression of endothelial-cell NOS (eNOS) and ACE mRNA in the LV and its relation to myocardial remodeling in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats were evaluated. Fifteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were given L-NAME (60 mg/ kg/day) in drinking water for 6 weeks to induce hypertension, and then treated with imidapril (L-NAME-I, n = 8, 1 mg/kg/day, subdepressor dose), or a vehicle (L-NAME-V, n = 7) for 4 weeks. Age-matched rats (C, n = 7) served as a control group. Blood pressure in L-NAME-V and L-NAME-I was similar and significantly higher than that in C. The level of eNOS mRNA in the LV was significantly decreased in L-NAME-V compared with C, and was significantly increased in L-NAME-I compared with C and L-NAME-V. The ACE mRNA and type I collagen mRNA expression levels were significantly increased in L-NAME-V compared with C, and significantly suppressed in L-NAME-I compared with L-NAME-V. L-NAME-V demonstrated a significant increase in wall-to-lumen ratio, perivascular fibrosis, and myocardial fibrosis. These changes in the microvasculature were improved significantly by imidapril. Myocardial remodeling in L-NAME-induced hypertensive rats was significantly ameliorated by a subdepressor dose of imidapril, which may be due to an increase in local eNOS mRNA expression and a decrease in angiotensin II in the LV.", 
    "161": "The objective was to compare the compliance of hypertensive patients treated with captopril twice daily or trandolapril once daily. After a 2-week placebo period, hypertensive patients (diastolic BP 95-115 mm Hg) were randomly allocated to trandolapril 2 mg once daily or to captopril 25 mg twice daily for 6 months. Trandolapril and captopril were packed in electronic pill-boxes equipped with a microprocessor that recorded date and time of each opening (MEMS). Patients' compliance was assessed both by standard pill-count and by electronic monitoring. Blood pressure was measured using a validated semi-automatic device at the end of the placebo period and of the treatment period. One hundred sixty-two patients entered the study. Compliance data were evaluable for 133 patients (62 in the captopril group and 71 in the trandolapril group). Treatment groups were comparable at baseline except for age (P = .046). Using electronic pill-box, overall compliance was 98.9% in the trandolapril group and 97.5% in the captopril group (P = .002). The percentage of missed doses was 2.6% in the trandolapril group and 3.3% in the captopril group (P = .06). The percentage of delayed doses was 1.8% in the trandolapril group and 11.7% in the captopril group (P = .0001). The percentage of correct dosing periods, ie, a period with only one correct recorded opening, was 94.0% in the trandolapril group and 78.1% in the captopril group (P = .0001). Results were unchanged when adjusted for age. At the end of the study, 41% of patients in the trandolapril group and 27% in the captopril group (NS) had their blood pressure normalized (systolic BP <140 and diastolic BP <90 mm Hg). In this 6-month study, the electronic pill-box allowed refined analysis of compliance of hypertensive patients. Patients' compliance with once daily trandolapril was higher than with twice daily captopril. The between-group difference is mainly explained by an increase in delayed doses in the twice daily group.", 
    "162": "Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (AIIA) are both pharmacological groups that inhibit the actions of angiotensin II. ACEI prevent the formation of angiotensin II from angiotensin I, whereas A II A inhibit the final crucial step of angiotensin II binding with the AT1 receptor site. A similar antihypertensive efficacy has been described for both groups but A II A drugs have a better safety profile above all due to the absence of dry cough. Despite the fact that evidence with ACEI is more conclusive, A II A seems to achieve the same protective effects on the target organ damage in hypertensive patients. At present, ACEI are the drugs of choice in the treatment of patients with cardiac dysfunction and failure. The information of ongoing trials with A II A will be of great value in deciding the optimal treatment for hypertensive patients with different cardiovascular diseases.",

Recent work has shown striking fibrotic constrictions at the glomerulotubular neck in porcine radiation nephropathy and in Wegener's granulomatosis in man. The present studies were designed to identify stenotic necks in a third species and to evaluate the effect of captopril treatment. Experimental radiation nephropathy was established with 17 Gy total body irradiation of barrier-maintained rats. Kidneys were obtained at 99 and 203 days for histology, using perfusion fixation. There was renal injury, with a rise in BUN, as expected, which was attenuated by captopril treatment. There was stenotic neck formation at 99 and 203 days. Captopril did not influence the absolute fraction of necks that were stenotic but it did prevent the evolution of glomeruli with necks to atubular glomeruli. It is concluded that stenosis of the glomerulotubular neck is a general phenomenon of any scarring kidney disease; that stenotic necks are probably an intermediate step in the evolution towards atubular glomeruli; and that timely use of captopril may prevent the progression of a stenotic neck towards an atubular glomerulus.", 
    "164": "A growing body of evidence supports the notion that angiotensin II (Ang II), the central product of the renin-angiotensin system, may play a central role not only in the etiology of hypertension but also in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal diseases in humans. In this review, we focus on the role of Ang II in cardiovascular and renal diseases at the molecular and cellular levels and discuss up-to-date evidence concerning the in vitro and in vivo actions of Ang II and the pharmacological effects of angiotensin receptor antagonists in comparison with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Ang II, via AT(1) receptor, directly causes cellular phenotypic changes and cell growth, regulates the gene expression of various bioactive substances (vasoactive hormones, growth factors, extracellular matrix components, cytokines, etc.), and activates multiple intracellular signaling cascades (mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, tyrosine kinases, various transcription factors, etc.) in cardiac myocytes and fibroblasts, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, and renal mesangial cells. These actions are supposed to participate in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling, heart failure, vascular thickening, atherosclerosis, and glomerulosclerosis. Furthermore, in vivo recent evidence suggest that the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and activator protein-1 by Ang II may play the key role in cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, there are still unresolved questions and controversies on the mechanism of Ang II-mediated cardiovascular and renal diseases.",

The assay is based on the high performance liquid chromatographic separation of the synthetic substrate hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine, the hydrolysis product hippuric acid and the test compound. Using the new method, the diuretic drug ethacrynic acid was found to act as an inhibitor for the enzyme in a non competitive mode.",

The first method (A) is based on the reaction of the drug with chloranil in aqueous solution of pH 9.5 to give yellow colour measured at 346 nm. The second method (B) is based upon the interaction of lisinopril with dichlone resulting in the formation of an intense purple colour measured at 580 nm. The third method (C) depends on the reaction of the drug with acetylacetone and formaldehyde to form a coloured condensation product measured at 356 nm and also has a strong fluorescence at 475 nm (lambda(ex) 410 nm). This method is extended to determine lisinopril in binary mixtures with hydrochlorothiazide. The last method (D) depends on measuring the first and second derivative spectra of lisinopril. Moreover, the derivative method is used as stability-indicating method where lisinopril can be determined in presence of its degradation products. The proposed methods proved to be suitable for a rapid quality control of commercial dosage forms. The results obtained were precise and accurate.",

    "172": "Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system began as a way of studying the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease with specific pharmacological probes. Oral activity, achieved by shortening the original peptide structures, transformed the probes into therapeutic agents, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. However, ACE is a non-specific target for blocking the renin-angiotensin enzymatic cascade. The availability of orally active drugs turned ACE inhibition into a therapeutic breakthrough but more specific blockade always seemed desirable. This goal has now been achieved with the orally active angiotensin II receptor antagonists; six are on the market and more are under development. This new class of drugs is equal in efficacy to ACE inhibitors, at least in hypertensive patients. Trials now underway will demonstrate whether angiotensin II receptor antagonists can prevent target-organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. If they do, these compounds might one day replace ACE inhibitors.",

To determine whether the antihypertensive response in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) salt-treated rats was mediated by kinins on the luminal side of renal tubules or in the circulation, selective urinary kininase inhibitors were administered to normal Brown Norway Kitasato (BN-Ki) rats and kininogen-deficient Brown Norway Katholiek (BN-Ka) rats. 2. Kinins were degraded by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and carboxypeptidase Y-like kininase (CPY) in urine, but were inactivated mainly by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in the plasma. 3. Ebelactone B inhibited CPY, while poststatin inhibited CPY and NEP. 4. Daily administration of poststatin (5 mg/kg per day, s.c.) for 3 days reduced blood pressure (BP) in DOCA salt-treated BN-Ki rats, but not in BN-Ka rats. 5. Ebelactone B (5 mg/kg per day, s.c.) also reduced BP in BN-Ki rats, which was accompanied by increased urinary sodium excretion, but had no effect on BP in BN-Ka rats. 6. Lisinopril (5 mg/kg per day, s.c.) had no effect on BP in either rat strain. 7. Arterial kinin levels in BN-Ki rats increased significantly (2.2-4.6 pg/mL) with captopril (10 mg/kg, s.c.). However, arterial kinin levels that induced hypotension following the infusion of bradykinin (1000 ng/kg per min, i.v.) were 110-fold higher than endogenous arterial kinin levels attained following captopril. 8. These results suggest that inhibition of kinin degradation on the luminal side of the renal tubules may effectively attenuate hypertension.",

Control L-arg infusion had no effect on renal plasma flow (RPF) (paraminohippuric acid clearance) and renal vascular resistance (RVR), whereas the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (inulin clearance) decreased (98 +/- 4 versus 89 +/- 5 ml/min; P< 0.05), resulting in a decrease in filtration fraction (P< 0.05). After ramipril, L-arg induced renal vasodilation as indicated by significant changes in RPF (576 +/- 41 versus 669 +/- 21 ml/min; P< 0.01) and RVR (P< 0.05). The GFR did not change statistically after ramipril pretreatment (91 +/- 3 versus 97 +/- 4 ml/min; not significant); however, the trend was different as compared with control (F= 5.7, P < 0.05). L-Arg-induced renal vasodilation was also observed after losartan (RPF, 637 +/- 34 versus 706 +/- 40 ml/min; P< 0.05). Enhanced renal and systemic responses to L-arg after ACE inhibitor and AT1B were associated with a rise in plasma L-citrulline levels, which was greater than after control L-arg (P < 0.05). However, other indicators of NO activity such as plasma and urinary cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, and nitrates, remained unchanged throughout all experiments.",

    "178": "Leaf metabolites, adenylates, and Rubisco activation were studied in two transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv W38) types. Plants with reduced amounts of cytochrome b/f complex (anti-b/f) have impaired electron transport and a low transthylakoid pH gradient that restrict ATP and NADPH synthesis. Plants with reduced glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (anti-GAPDH) have a decreased capacity to use ATP and NADPH in carbon assimilation. The activation of the chloroplast NADP-malate dehydrogenase decreased in anti-b/f plants, indicating a low NADPH/NADP(+) ratio. The whole-leaf ATP/ADP in anti-b/f plants was similar to wild type, while it increased in anti-GAPDH plants. In both plant types, the CO(2) assimilation rates decreased with decreasing ribulose 1, 5-bisphosphate concentrations. In anti-b/f plants, CO(2) assimilation was further compromised by reduced carbamylation of Rubisco, whereas in anti-GAPDH plants the carbamylation remained high even at subsaturating ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate concentrations. We propose that the low carbamylation in anti-b/f plants is due to reduced activity of Rubisco activase. The results suggest that light modulation of activase is not directly mediated via the electron transport rate or stromal ATP/ADP, but some other manifestation of the balance between electron transport and the consumption of its products. Possibilities include the transthylakoid pH gradient and the reduction state of the acceptor side of photosystem I and/or the degree of reduction of the thioredoxin pathway.",

This blunted natriuretic effect of loop diuretics was caused by RAAS activation, which could partly be reversed by ACE inhibition. ACE inhibitors increased natriuresis by 22% in the high renin group (p = 0.029), but had no effect in the normal and low renin groups. Within the low renin group, five of the 11 patients had persistently low renin levels despite ACE inhibition.

    "189": "The morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease presents an enormous humanistic and economic burden in the United States. In Texas, cardiovascular disease has been the leading cause of death since 1950. Risk-factor modification has been targeted in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including lipid management, smoking cessation, improved control of blood pressure, physical activity, weight management, the use of antiplatelet agents/anticoagulants, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in congestive heart failure, beta blockers after myocardial infarction, and estrogen replacement therapy. The Heart Care Partnership (HCP) is a multifaceted interactive program designed to improve risk-factor management in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease through physician education, participation, and consensus development in addition to practice improvement processes and patient education. Development and implementation of the Texas HCP was a joint effort of the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Affiliate of the American Heart Association, and Merck & Co. This program helps hospitals improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with heart disease. Program resources include educational workshops, quality improvement processes, and patient educational materials. HCP workshops address the treatment gap, define optimal care, and help define institution-specific plans for treating heart disease. Quality-improvement processes provide hospitals with baseline data and tools to improve and measure outcomes over time. The HCP workshops are provided as a combination of lectures, interactive discussions, and small group planning sessions designed to encourage audience participation. Upon completing the HCP program, participants are able to (1) describe the evidence-based medicine supporting secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease; (2) identify and prioritize cardiovascular disease risk factors for secondary prevention; (3) identify barriers to and solutions for implementing secondary prevention; and (4) develop site-based plans for cardiovascular risk-factor modification with definite time lines for implementation (\"care maps\"). The HCP's initial audit of medical practices indicates that Texas appears to share the same deficiencies in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease as the rest of the country. However, improvements can be demonstrated in both the hospital and physician office settings through the HCP. The HCP facilitated the cooperation of the medical community in the state of Texas to work together in a synchronized, communicative manner to decrease coronary events. This partnership represents a watershed event in the history of Texas medicine. It is the first time that such a statewide team approach to address a public health issue has been initiated. In the past, medical organizations within the state have had disparate goals and multiple strategies for achieving them.", 
    "190": "Despite clear and consistent clinical-trial evidence that secondary-prevention medical therapies reduce mortality in patients with established coronary artery disease, these therapies are underutilized in patients receiving conventional care. To address this issue, a Cardiac Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) focused on initiation of aspirin, cholesterol-lowering medication (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitor titrated to achieve low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol < 100 mg/dL), beta-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor therapy in conjunction with diet and exercise counseling before hospital discharge in patients with established coronary artery disease was designed and implemented at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center starting in 1994. This treatment program was based on the hypothesis that initiation of therapy in the hospital setting would result in higher utilization rates both at the time of discharge and during longer-term follow-up. Implementation of this program involved the use of a focused treatment guideline, standardized admission orders, educational lectures by local thought leaders, and tracking/reporting of treatment rates. To assess the impact of the program, treatment rates and clinical outcome were compared in patients discharged in the 2-year periods before and after CHAMP was implemented. Hospital-based treatment protocols such as CHAMP have the potential to significantly increase treatment utilization of therapies previously demonstrated to improve survival and thus substantially improve the outcome of the 2 million patients diagnosed and hospitalized each year with coronary artery disease.",

Beta blockers are additive to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in their effects on CCF. Beta blockers have been shown in most studies to increase ejection fraction, cardiac output, and exercise capacity and are sometimes capable of resolving almost all the symptoms of heart failure. Treatment should begin with the smallest possible dose and this should be gradually increased to the maximum tolerated level.", 
    "192": "Chronic heart failure is a common clinical syndrome that may have different causes. Its incidence and prevalence are predicted to rise substantially over the next 10 years. There are therefore major consequences for resource provision, especially in primary care, where most patients are managed. Chronic heart failure is a serious condition with high morbidity and mortality. There is good evidence to show that treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction improves symptoms and signs, slows progression of heart failure, reduces hospitalisation rates, and improves survival. Despite this evidence, primary care studies show that patients with heart failure are incorrectly diagnosed and inadequately treated. Most patients present in general practice, and because effective treatment relies on a correct diagnosis, this is a key step in the appropriate management of heart failure. The aim of this paper is to review the evidence about the usefulness of signs, symptoms, and investigations in diagnosing heart failure in primary care. To identify relevant studies for this review, four strategies were used: a MEDLINE search from 1993 to January 1998 using the diagnosis search filter; a MEDLINE search from 1993 to January 1998 using the guideline search filter to locate published heart failure guidelines; a search for review articles in the Cochrane Library; and a check of references in the studies identified. The search terms included MeSH terms and the keywords 'heart failure' and 'diagnosis'. All searches were limited to humans and English language articles. Studies were included in this review on the basis of quality and relevance to primary care. The review shows that symptoms and signs are important because they alert clinicians to the possibility of heart failure as a diagnosis. However, they are not sufficiently specific for confirming left ventricular systolic dysfunction. From the evidence available, a patient with suspected heart failure must have objective tests to confirm the diagnosis. These should include an electrocardiogram and, ideally, an echocardiogram. Further research is also needed on the usefulness of signs and symptoms in primary care, as most studies of heart failure have been conducted in secondary care.",

Twenty-six patients were treated with 50-100 mg atenolol and 27 patients with 2-4 mg trandolapril o.d. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests, euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamps and serum lipid measurements were performed after 8 and 48 weeks of active treatment. After 48 weeks insulin sensitivity was reduced by 23% by atenolol while it remained unchanged during trandolapril treatment (+0.5%, P = 0.0010 for difference between treatments, ANCOVA). The effect on triglycerides (+22% vs -8.5%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-13% vs +0.7%) also differed significantly between atenolol and trandolapril. Results after 8 weeks were similar. Glucose tolerance was not affected by either drug. Atenolol reduced diastolic blood pressure (DBP) better than trandolapril (-15.3 mm Hg vs -6.6 mm Hg for supine DBP after 48 weeks, P = 0.012). The difference in effect on insulin sensitivity between the drugs corresponded to 25% of the baseline values of insulin sensitivity, and persisted over 48 weeks of treatment.

    "194": "Information from clinical and pharmacokinetic studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) has come from subjects who are mostly male and Caucasian, but the use of ACEIs extends to populations worldwide. Significant differences between Chinese in general and male Caucasians have been demonstrated in the pharmacokinetics/dynamics of other drug classes that could have implications for the use of ACEIs in the Chinese population. These include: significant Chinese/Caucasian genetic variation in the renin-angiotensin system based on an insertion/deletion (O/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene; the genetic determination of plasma ACE activity in the Chinese population; and genetic factors involving the disease substrate which may also influence the response to treatment. Oral and IV pharmacokinetic data from various studies of Chinese and Caucasian subjects are available for cilazapril, fosinopril, and perindopril, and pharmacodynamic data are available for eight different ACEIs. Based on these data, there are few differences among the pharmacokinetics of ACEIs between Chinese and Caucasians. Most ACEIs showed good blood pressure lowering efficacy in Chinese (benazepril, enalapril, fosinopril and spirapril), with perhaps less blood pressure lowering with cilazapril or a relatively shorter-term effect with cilazapril or perindopril compared to Caucasions. Chinese experience more cough from ACEIs (captopril and enalapril) than Caucasians. Data suggest that fosinopril may not induce cough in as many subjects as other ACEIs, and this seems to be true of Chinese as well. The mechanism, currently unknown, could involve fosinopril's dual elimination pathway (hepatic and renal). Pharmacokinetic data also support the use of fosinopril in congestive heart failure where elimination pathways may be impaired. In conclusion, ethnic differences between Chinese and Caucasians with respect to ACE and AGT gene polymorphism, which might be expected to differentially affect the action of ACEIs in these two ethnic groups, do not, in fact, have such an effect. Rather, differences among the ACEIs appear to be more important. Journal of Human Hypertension (2000) 14, 163-170.",

Similar changes in renal morphology and function also develop in mice with targeted inactivation of the genes that encode angiotensinogen, angiotensin converting enzyme, or both AT1 receptor isoforms simultaneously. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that an intact signalling through AT1 receptors is a prerequisite for normal renal development In a recent study, an increased incidence of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract was detected in mice deficient in the angiotensin II type-2 receptor, suggesting that this receptor subtype is also involved in the development of the genitourinary tract The present report mainly reviews the renal abnormalities that have been induced by blocking the RAS pharmacologically or by gene targeting in experimental animal models. In addition, pathogenetic mechanisms and clinical implications are discussed.",

One hundred and twenty-two adult outpatients were randomised to receive either valsartan 80 mg or 160 mg, captopril 25 mg or placebo for 360 days. Changes from baseline to endpoint in plasma lipid parameters were measured. The primary criterion for tolerability was the incidence of adverse events. All treatment groups showed minor changes in lipid parameters. Triglyceride increased by 2.7% (valsartan 160 mg) to 9.1% (placebo). Total cholesterol decreased under valsartan 80 mg, while other groups showed increases of up to 0.031 mmol/l.

Difficulties encountered with such topic based on the fact that the drug is freely water soluble and for obvious reasons, such drug is difficult to be delivered orally in a sustained or controlled release manner and, on another hand, the drug is unstable in the alkaline pH of the intestine, which enabled the scientists to localize the developed formulations at the targeted areas of the GIT. Due to its effectiveness and intensive use as a drug of choice in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, numerous sustained and controlled release formulations of captopril have been made and reported. Despite of these numerous attempts and works, very few have been successful and some of these formulations have been patented.

We observed prolonged hypoglycemia in a number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and conducted a case-control study at two Canadian centers to identify such risk factors. Through hospital, pharmacy, and dialysis program records, we retrospectively identified 7 case patients and 31 controls with ESRD and type 2 diabetes using oral hypoglycemic monotherapy. Control patients had no history of hospital admission for prolonged hypoglycemia. All case patients and 28 controls were receiving glyburide (glibenclamide in Europe); the remainder were treated with tolbutamide. Duration of intravenous treatment for hypoglycemia ranged from 28 to 256 hours, with 83 g to 2 kg of glucose administered per episode. Preceding treatment with glyburide varied from 2 days to 13 years. Univariate analyses showed a recent decline in oral intake (odds ratio [OR], 81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 1,840), previous hypoglycemic episodes (OR, 15; 95% CI, 0.77 to 297), longer duration of diabetes (22 versus 12 years; P = 0.008), and a history of cerebrovascular disease (OR, 7. 0; 95% CI, 1.0 to 47) to be associated with prolonged hypoglycemia. No association between prolonged hypoglycemia and age, sex, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, oral hypoglycemic dose, or duration of treatment was identified. This study describes the potentially devastating effect of sulfonylurea-based oral hypoglycemic therapy in ESRD. Patients at greatest risk appear to be those with reduced intake, previous hypoglycemic episodes, and longer duration of diabetes. We describe the mechanisms for observed hypoglycemia and suggest that alternative drugs may be considered in this patient group.",

The aim of this prospective, randomized study is to compare the effects of the calcium channel blocker amlodipine and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril as first-line therapy on blood pressure, renal function, and urinary albumin excretion in hypertensive patients with ADPKD. Twenty-four patients with ADPKD with hypertension with creatinine clearances (Ccrs) greater than 50 mL/min/1.73 m(2) were included in the study. Twelve patients received amlodipine (mean dose, 9 mg/d), and 12 patients received enalapril (mean dose, 17 mg/d). The patients were followed up for 5 years. Baseline mean arterial pressures, which were 109 +/- 3 mm Hg in the amlodipine group and 108 +/- 3 mm Hg in the enalapril group, decreased significantly after 1 year of follow-up (amlodipine, 96 +/- 3 mm Hg; P < 0.005; enalapril, 89 +/- 2 mm Hg; P < 0.0005) and remained stable at year 5 (amlodipine, 97 +/- 3 mm Hg; P < 0.0005 versus baseline; enalapril, 94 +/- 3 mm Hg; P < 0.005 versus baseline). Ccrs, which were 83 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the amlodipine group and 77 +/- 6 mL/min/1.73 m(2) in the enalapril group, remained stable after 1 year of follow-up and decreased significantly at year 3 in both groups (amlodipine, 67 +/- 5 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < 0.01 versus year 1 and baseline; enalapril, 58 +/- 4 mL/min/1.73 m(2); P < 0.05 versus year 1 and P < 0.0005 versus baseline) with no significant change thereafter. No change was observed in urinary albumin-creatinine ratio in the amlodipine group (baseline, 68 +/- 21 mg/g; year 1, 52 +/- 21 mg/g; year 5, 148 +/- 74 mg/g), whereas it decreased significantly in the enalapril group at year 1 (baseline, 23 +/- 4 mg/g; year 1, 13 +/- 3 mg/g; P < 0.05) and remained stable until the end of the study at year 5 (14 +/- 6 mg/g). The investigators concluded that blood pressure was similar in both groups but only enalapril had a significant effect to sustain decreased urinary albumin excretion for a 5-year follow-up. Although proteinuria has been considered a surrogate of renal disease progression, further studies will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis in ADPKD, because after 5 years, no differences in renal function were observed between the enalapril and amlodipine groups. In comparison with patients with ADPKD with uncontrolled hypertension, effective control of blood pressure, as undertaken in the present study, should delay the onset of ESRD by approximately 15 years.", 
    "214": "Patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy (IMN) and persistent nephrotic-range proteinuria are at risk for progression to end-stage renal failure. Whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are also renoprotective in these patients remains elusive. In 14 patients with IMN (patients) and persistent proteinuria (protein > 3 g/24 h for >6 months), we studied mean arterial pressure (MAP), urinary protein excretion, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and albumin and neutral dextran fractional clearance after 2 months washout from previous antihypertensive treatment (basal), after 2 months of enalapril (2.5 to 20 mg/d) therapy (posttreatment), and 2 months after enalapril withdrawal (recovery). MAP, proteinuria, and GFR were also measured at the same time points in 6 patients with IMN and persistent overt proteinuria maintained on conventional treatment throughout the study period (controls). Basal MAP, proteinuria, and GFR were similar in the two study groups. However, in patients at the end of the treatment period, MAP (posttreatment, 99.6 +/- 11.2 versus basal, 103.3 +/- 12.1 mm Hg; P < 0.05), proteinuria (posttreatment protein, 5.0 +/- 2.9 versus basal, 7.1 +/- 4.9 g/24 h; P < 0.05), albumin fractional clearance (posttreatment median, 1.7 x 10(-3); range, 0.2 to 22.7 x 10(-3) versus basal median, 4.1 x 10(-3); range, 0.4 to 22. 1 x 10(-3); P < 0.05), and fractional clearance of largest neutral dextrans (radii from 62 to 66 A) were significantly less than basal values. At recovery, MAP significantly increased to 106.6 +/- 11.7 mm Hg (P < 0.001 versus enalapril), but all other parameters remained less than basal values. GFR and RPF were similar at each evaluation. Changes in proteinuria after treatment withdrawal positively correlated (r = 0.72; P < 0.01) with baseline GFR. Theoretical analysis of dextran-sieving data indicated that ACE inhibitor treatment significantly improved glomerular membrane size-selective dysfunction. This effect persisted more than 2 months after treatment withdrawal. No patient had symptomatic hypotension, acute renal function deterioration, or hyperkalemia during enalapril treatment. Thus, in patients with IMN and long-term nephrotic syndrome, ACE inhibitor treatment, but not conventional therapy, improves glomerular barrier size selectivity. The antiproteinuric effect of ACE inhibition is long lasting, especially in patients with more severe renal insufficiency. This is the premise of a long-term renoprotective effect that may limit the need for treatment with more toxic drugs.",

A drug-based etiology was implicated in 14 cases: the drugs included antibiotics, lipid-lowering agents, anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines, hydroxychloroquine sulfate, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Over one-third of patients with drug-related eruptions had other medical illnesses associated with cutaneous granulomatous inflammation, namely rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn's disease, hepatitis C, diabetes mellitus, and thyroiditis. A microbial trigger was implicated in 12 patients in the context of infective id reactions to herpes zoster, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or streptococci, or active infections by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. leprae, fungi, and spirochetes. The remainder had hepatobiliary disease and RA without obvious exogenous triggers, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), and idiopathic lichenoid eruptions (i.e. LP, lichen nitidus, and lichen striatus). One patient with LP had underlying multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. The histiocytic infiltrate assumed one or more of five light microscopic patterns: (i) superficially disposed loose histiocytic aggregates; (ii) cohesive granulomata within zones of band-like lymphocytic infiltration with or without deeper dermal extension; (iii) a diffuse interstitial pattern; (iv) scattered singly disposed giant cells; and (v) granulomatous vasculitis. Additional features included lymphocytic eccrine hidradenitis in those patients with drug reactions, hepatobiliary disease, and antecedent viral illnesses, tissue eosinophilia and erythrocyte extravasation in drug hypersensitivity, granulomatous vasculitis in patients with microbial triggers, drug hypersensitivity or RA, and lymphoid atypia in lesions of CTCL or drug hypersensitivity.",

    "219": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in rat kidney is localized to the macula densa and the immediately proximal cTALH and increases after salt restriction. Either ACE inhibitors or AT1 receptor blockers increase COX-2 expression in both control and salt-restricted animals, suggesting that the RAS activation feedback inhibits renal cortical COX-2 expression. To determine whether increased COX-2 expression in response to ACE inhibition mediated increases in renin production, rats were treated with Captopril for 1 week with or without the specific COX-2 inhibitor, SC58236. Plasma renin activity increased significantly in the Captopril group. This increase was partially reversed by simultaneous treatment with SC58236. Kidney renin activity also increased in the Captopril group compared with control, which was also significantly inhibited by SC58236 treatment. Because of the localization of bNOS to MD and surrounding cTALH, the current study investigated the role of NO in the regulation of COX-2 expression. Rats were fed a normal diet, low salt diet or low salt diet combined with captopril and half of them were treated with the neuronal NOS inhibitor, 7-NI, and half with vehicle. After 7 days, mRNA was extracted and the microsome proteins purified from renal cortex. COX-2 mRNA expression was measured by Northern-blot and normalized with GAPDH. 7-NI treatment decreased COX-2 mRNA and immunoreactive COX-2 expression in each group. In summary, these studies indicate that COX-2 from macula densa/cTALH is a regulator of renin production and release. Angiotensin II may be a negative regulator of cTALH/macula densa COX-2 expression, and NO may mediate increased renal cortical COX-2 expression seen in volume depletion. These studies suggest important interactions between the NO and COX-2 systems in the regulation of arteriolar tone and the renin-angiotensin system by the macula densa.",

Basal NO synthesis was blocked for 2 weeks with L-nitro-arginine methylester (L-NAME) in sham and MI rats and similar contractility experiments were performed. The effect of captopril treatment from 2 to 5 weeks post-MI on vasoconstrictor responses was also tested.",

Vasoconstrictor responses to K+ and delta Rmax were reduced at 2 weeks after MI. This reduction in vasoconstrictor ability was similar to that seen in L-NAME-treated sham rats, while chronic L-NAME treatment did not affect vasoconstrictor reactivity in MI rats. Similarly, L-NAME induced an increase in mean arterial pressure in sham rats, but not in MI rats. At 5 weeks after MI, vasoconstriction to 125 mM K+ and delta Rmax were still reduced in MI rats; this response was however partially restored after captopril treatment.",

(ii) Substance P: In resistance arteries, relaxations were only present in the adult. In the other two types of arteries, rudimentary relaxations were present from the mature foetal stage onward. (iii) Bradykinin: In resistance arteries, identical relaxations were present at all ages which, in the foetus and the adult, were insensitive to changes in O2 levels (95 to 8%). In conduit arteries, concentration-dependent relaxations were present from birth, increasing in amplitude with age and these were potentiated by captopril. Foetal conduit arteries relaxed to the single application of 0.1 mumol/l bradykinin, indicating age-dependent tachyphylaxis.", 
    "227": "(i) Bradykinin is unique among endothelium-dependent vasodilators in being able to relax all vascular segments, at all ages, subject to tachyphylaxis and bradykinin-breakdown but independent of the prevailing O2 concentration. (ii) Heterogeneity of the relaxations between conduit and resistance arteries is evident from the mature foetal stage onward. (iii) The type of agonist, the type of vessel and the age each independently determine the presence or absence of endothelial relaxations. Therefore, the perinatal pulmonary circulation is not immature with respect to endothelial-dependent relaxation; rather, the nature of this process changes within the perinatal period and between birth and adulthood.",

In HCAs Ang II was only three times more potent than Ang I, wheres, in the experiments with Ang I, comparison of ClAngI with ClAngII and RAngII indicated that most of the arterially produced Ang II did not reach the bath fluid. Also in PCAs Ang I and II showed similar potency. In HCAs both the ACE inhibitor, captopril, and the chymase inhibitor, chymostatin, inhibited Ang I-evoked vasoconstriction, while only chymostatin had a significant effect on ClAngI.

At this dosage, fosinopril significantly reduced blood pressure from 93 +/- 2 mmHg before treatment to 70 +/- 2 mmHg at the end of the treatment period (P < 0.005). Fosinopril also increased the resistance of the mice plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) to CuSO4-induced oxidation, as shown by a 90% reduction in the LDL content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and also by a prolongation of the lag time required for the initiation of LDL oxidation (from 100 min in the placebo-treated mice to more than 240 min in the fosinopril-treated mice; P < 0.001). In addition, fosinopril inhibited CuSO4-induced oxidation of LDL that was obtained from the aortas of the treated mice, as shown by an 18% and 37% reduction in the LDL content of lipid peroxides and hydroperoxy-cholesterol linoleate, respectively, compared with the placebo-treated mice (P < 0.01). A low dosage of fosinopril (5 mg/kg/d) that was still adequate to reduce their plasma ACE activity and LDL propensity to lipid peroxidation was insufficient to lower their blood pressure. This dosage also reduced the aortic lesion size in the apo E deficient mice by 40% (P < 0.01).",

The iNOS mRNA and protein and the fibrosis factor expression of type I collagen mRNA were significantly increased in DSCHF-V compared with DR-C, and significantly decreased in DSCHF-I compared with DSCHF-V. DSCHF-V demonstrated a significant increase in wall-to-lumen ratio, perivascular fibrosis, and myocardial fibrosis. These changes in the microvasculature were improved significantly by imidapril.",

    "240": "Adverse events during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery have been described in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, including hypotension on induction of anaesthesia and an increase in vasoconstrictor requirements after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Omitting regular ACE inhibitor medication before surgery may improve cardiovascular stability during anaesthesia. We evaluated prospectively the effect of omitting regular ACE inhibitor medication before CABG surgery on haemodynamic variables and use of vasoactive drugs. We studied 40 patients with good left ventricular function, allocated randomly to omit or continue ACE inhibitor medication before surgery. Arterial pressure, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance and use of vasoactive drugs were recorded during anaesthesia and in the early postoperative period. Patients who omitted their ACE inhibitors had greater mean arterial pressure during the study and required less vasopressors during CPB. However, these patients required more vasodilators to control hypertension after CPB and in the early postoperative period. There was no difference in hypotension on induction of anaesthesia or in the use of vasoconstrictors after CPB. We conclude that omitting ACE inhibitors before surgery did not have sufficient advantage to be recommended routinely.",

These studies have involved almost 10,000 patients to date and have consistently shown that the long-term administration of beta-blockers is associated with a highly significant improvement in both left ventricular function and prognosis of the patients with heart failure. The evidence supporting the use of beta-blockers now equals or even surpasses that of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; therefore beta-blockers should be considered part of standard therapy. Issues that remain unclarified include the mechanisms through which beta-blockers may improve cardiac function and their tolerability and efficacy in specific groups of patients (such as those with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction, severe heart failure, the elderly, or those with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction). It is not currently clear whether the pharmacologic differences between individual beta-blockers are clinically relevant.

    "243": "The influence of a renal injury on the disposition of benazeprilat, the active moiety of benazepril, and of enalaprilat, the active moiety of enalapril, two angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACEI), having different routes of elimination in dog was investigated during a mild renal insufficiency obtained by a nephrectomy-electrocoagulation method reducing glomerular filtration rate by approximately 50%. Plasma concentrations of the active moieties were analyzed with a physiologically based model taking into account the binding to ACE (high affinity, low capacity). An influence of renal insufficiency on enalapril disposition was shown with an increase in its plasma concentration, which was correlated to the reduction of the glomerular filtration rate. No such effect was evidenced for benazepril. With the physiologically based model analysis, it was shown that renal impairment led to an increase of the apparent benazeprilat clearance (260%), whereas that of enalaprilat was reduced to 40 to 55%. Renal insufficiency had no significant effect either on the apparent volume of distribution of each drug or on the binding parameters [i.e., maximal binding capacity (B(max)) and affinity (K(d))]. Enalaprilat and benazeprilat inhibitory action on ACE also was evaluated ex vivo. Similar patterns of inhibition were observed for both drugs. Renal injury had no significant influence on the overall effect of benazeprilat, whereas the inhibition effect of enalaprilat was significantly increased. It was concluded that renal insufficiency may have effects on the ACEI disposition but that the measurable active moiety plasma concentration is not the most appropriate endpoint to describe and interpret the consequence of a renal injury on ACEI.", 
    "244": "The pharmacokinetic disposition of benazeprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (ACEI), was assessed with a nonlinear binding model in dogs. A single oral benazepril dose, a single i.v. benazeprilat dose, or a daily oral dose of benazepril for 14 consecutive days was administered. The activity of benazeprilat was assessed by measuring plasma ACE inhibition with an ex vivo assay. Benazeprilat data were fitted to equations corresponding to a monocompartmental model with a volume equal to the extracellular space ( approximately 0.2 l/kg) in which a fraction of benazeprilat was nonlinearily bound to ACE with both a saturable tissue and nontissue binding. The half-life of benazeprilat elimination determined from this physiologically based model was 39 +/- 6 min. The estimated maximal binding capacity of benazeprilat to ACE was approximately 23.5 nmol/kg, 90% of which was tissular. The estimated equilibrium constant of dissociation (K(d)) of benazeprilat to ACE was 2.7 to 4.5 nM. IC(50) values were one order of magnitude lower than K(d) values (i.e., approximately 0.27 nM). The nonlinear disposition of benazeprilat raised several issues and it was concluded that the benazeprilat concentration profile was only relevant to definition of an optimal dosage regimen if the appropriate kinetic model was used to interpret the plasma data.", 
    "245": "Compliance with and dosing of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as they occur before and after hospitalization for heart failure were studied, and factors predictive of compliance with and dosing of ACE inhibitors after hospitalization were identified. Two hundred thirty-six patients hospitalized with heart failure between October 1, 1995, and April 30, 1996, were identified. Compliance with and use and dosing of ACE inhibitors were examined over the 180-day period before admission and the 180-day period after discharge using an integrated pharmacy and medical claims database. Use of an ACE inhibitor was defined as at least one claim for an ACE inhibitor over the period examined, and dosing was assessed by calculating the mean percentage of an adequate daily dose dispensed. Before hospitalization 109 patients (46.2%) used ACE inhibitors, and after hospitalization 148 (62.7%) used them--a significant increase. ACE inhibitor use before hospitalization was a predictor of postdischarge use. Younger patients were more likely to take ACE inhibitors after hospitalization than older ones, and men had better compliance after hospitalization than women. Additional analyses revealed that, among hospitalized patients, compliance was lower in individuals who also took an antidepressant. Dosing increased from 72% to 85% of an adequate daily dose after hospitalization among patients who took ACE inhibitors during both prehospitalization and posthospitalization periods. However, almost one third of hospitalized patients stopped taking their ACE inhibitor within six months of hospital discharge. The study found few significant predictors of patient compliance after hospitalization. Dosing of ACE inhibitors before and after hospitalization needs to be improved.",

Treatment with enalapril maleate led to a statistically significant decrease of von Willebrand's factor in plasma and ex vivo platelet aggregation whereas flow-mediated dilatation increased.

Three thousand one hundred sixty-four patients with class II to IV heart failure and an ejection fraction below 30% were randomly assigned to double blind treatment with either low doses (2.5-5 mg/daily, n = 1596) or high doses (32.5-35 mg/daily, n = 1568) of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril for 39 to 58 months while background therapy for heart failure was continued. Patients in the high dose group had a non significant 8% lower risk of death (p = 0.128), but a significant 12% lower risk of death or hospitalizations for any reason (p = 0.002) and 24% fewer hospitalizations for heart failure (p = 0.002). Side-effects such as dizziness and renal insufficiency were more frequently encountered in the high dose group, but there was no difference between the two groups in terms of number of patients requiring discontinuation of study medication. These findings indicate that patients with heart failure should not, as too frequently is, be maintained on very low dose of an ACE inhibitor unless this is the only dose that can be tolerated. The patients are expected to benefit more if they receive higher doses close to those used in the large clinical trials which have demonstrated a reduction by ACE inhibition in morbidity and mortality in heart failure.",

    "257": "Hypertension and ischemic heart disease are important precursors of heart failure. The prevention of progression to heart failure is a prime objective when treating patients with hypertension or ischemic heart disease. In patients with hypertension, treatment with either diuretics or beta-blockers reduces the risk of chronic heart failure. In patients with ischemic heart disease, beta-blocker therapy reduces the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and ensuing cardiac dysfunction. The beneficial effects of beta-blocker therapy may be greater in post-infarction patients who have impaired left ventricular function than in those patients without such impairment. When considering heart failure itself, the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors has been demonstrated in patients with mild-to-severe left ventricular dysfunction and their use is indicated for all stages of heart failure to reduce symptoms and retard further impairment of left ventricular function. Diuretics and digitalis offer relief from the symptoms of the disease, while positive inotropes are reserved for parenteral administration in end-stage heart failure, as a bridge to transplantation, or in acute exacerbations of the disease. Added to standard therapy, beta-blockade is of value in the treatment of heart failure, preventing further deterioration and improving hemodynamics, exercise tolerance, quality of life, and longterm prognosis.",

After a 4-week placebo run-in, 446 hypertensive patients (mean age : 55.8 +/- 11.0 years) were randomised to receive Per/Ind or Ate for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measures were the changes in trough supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure (sSBP, sDBP) between baseline and the last observation. Equivalence was assessed in an intention-to-treat analysis using a two one-sided tests procedure. Per/Ind and Ate decreased sSBP by -20.5 mmHg and -20.1 mmHg, respectively; the 90% confidence interval [-2.3; 1.5] of the intertreatment difference (-0.4 mmHg) fell within the predefined equivalence interval [-8; +8 mmHg]. Similarly, the sDBP decreased by -15.1 mmHg (Per/Ind) and -16.2 mmHg (Ate) with an intertreatment difference of 1.1 mmHg whose 90% confidence interval [-0.1; 2.2 mmHg] fell within the predefined equivalence interval [-4; +4 mmHg]; thus antihypertensive efficacy of Per/Ind and Ate were equivalent (P <0.001). In patients older than 65, Per/Ind induces a statistically greater decrease in sSBP than Ate (P <0.05). Per/Ind was well tolerated.

BP should be controlled more strictly in this high-risk hypertensive population. Recently, many clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of lifestyle modification and antihypertensive agents, particularly beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with these agents that modify BP may benefit even normotensive patients after a myocardial infarction, although the benefit is greater in hypertensives.", 
    "260": "Angiotensin II is considered to have angiogenic properties. Nevertheless, several authors reported an increase in coronary capillary density after treatment with ACE inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of treatment with low doses of ACE inhibitor perindopril, low doses of the diuretic indapamide, or a combination of the two on microvascular structure in hearts from stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-sp). Young adult male SHR treated with indapamide (0.24 mg/kg/day), perindopril (0.76 mg/kg/day), or both were compared with untreated animals after 8 or 14 weeks of treatment. Survival of SHR-sp was significantly increased after treatment. Only perindopril alone or in combination with indapamide significantly decreased blood pressure and cardiac mass. Treatment also significantly increased capillary and myocyte densities but arteriolar density tended to decrease. External and internal diameters significantly increased in treated animals while arteriolar thickness remained the same. Thus, thickness in vessels of the same size was the greatest in untreated animals, followed by indapamide- and perindopril-treated rats with the thinnest walls in rats with combined treatment, and the treatment resulted in a significant increase in the lumen to wall ratio. Capillary and arteriolar growth responses in treated animals seem to indicate that the two are independently regulated processes. Treatment with indapamide alone at this dosage did not significantly influence most responses but in combination with perindopril it strengthened the effect of perindopril.", 
    "261": "Hypertension and atherosclerosis are each important causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. We have investigated the interaction between these conditions by breeding mice that are atherosclerotic due to lack of apolipoprotein (apo) E with mice that are hypertensive due to lack of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The doubly deficient mice (nnee) have higher blood pressure (BP) and increased atherosclerotic lesion size but no change in plasma lipoprotein profiles compared with normotensive but atherosclerotic (NNee) mice. The nnee mice also develop kidney damage, evidenced by increased plasma creatinine, decreased kidney weight/body weight ratio, and glomerular lipid deposition and calcification. Enalapril treatment abolishes the deleterious effects of eNOS deficiency on BP, atherosclerosis, and kidney dysfunction in nnee mice. In striking contrast, a genetic lack of inducible NOS, which does not affect BP, has no effect on the development of atherosclerotic lesions in Apoe(-/-) mice. We also observed a positive relationship between BP and size of atherosclerotic lesions These results suggest that the atherogenic effects of eNOS deficiency can be partially explained by an increase in BP and reemphasize the importance of controlling hypertension in preventing atherosclerosis.", 
    "262": "BACKGROUND: The Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rat is a new genetic model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). We investigated whether angiotensin inhibition influences the onset of NIDDM and brings about a regression of renal injury in diabetes mellitus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Six-week-old OLETF rats were treated with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors imidapril or enalapril for 16 weeks. Systolic blood pressure is increased in an age-dependent manner in OLETF rats. In this study, the elevation in systolic blood pressure was dose-dependently reduced by ACE inhibitor treatment. In OLETF rats, plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose increased and the glucosuria occurred at the age of 22 weeks. Simultaneously, OLETF rats exhibited proteinuria and nodular lesions in glomeruli. The ACE inhibitor treatment almost completely reduced glucosuria, and also decreased plasma concentrations of insulin and glucose in OLETF rats. ACE inhibitor treatment lessened the proteinuria and attenuated morphologically the severity of nodular lesions in OLETF rats. Moreover, increases in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in OLETF rats were reduced by the ACE inhibitor treatment, and the improvement of glomerular lesions was related to decreases of PAI-1 and angiotensin II levels in plasma but not to improvement of glucose metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: ACE inhibitors delay onset of NIDDM with attenuation of kidney injury. The regression of kidney lesions is probably due to angiotensin reductions but not to glucose metabolism per se. ACE inhibitor drug therapy may be useful in preventing NIDDM and the subsequent renal injury in patients with NIDDM.", 
    "263": "BACKGROUND: Substantial evidence has accumulated for the intrarenal generation of functionally important quantities of angiotensin II (Ang II). To assess the possibility that Ang II generation occurs beyond a barrier to diffusion from the vascular compartment, six angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors varying widely in their lipid solubility were employed in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and their normotensive controls (WKY). The biological end points were renal blood flow and its response to Ang II. RESULTS: Two ACE inhibitors, ramipril and captopril, induced a larger increase in renal blood flow and enhanced the renal vascular response to Ang II substantially more than did enalapril and lisinopril. The two prodrugs, enalapril and ramipril, which are substantially more lipophilic than the respective active drugs, enalaprilat and ramiprilat, showed equivalent responses. The partial agonist saralasin virtually abolished the renal vasodilator response to ramipril. The pattern of response was similar in WKY, but the responses were substantially smaller. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the concept that a functionally important compartment for intrarenal Ang II formation exists in the healthy rat and that this process is amplified in the SHR.", 
    "264": "BACKGROUND: Acute myocarditis can progress to chronic heart muscle disease and cardiomyopathy. In the coxsackievirus B(3) (CB(3)) mouse model of myocarditis, early administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ameliorated histopathological changes in inflammation, necrosis, and calcification and reduced heart weight. Late administration of captopril reduced heart weight but did not affect the histological findings. In this study, we investigated the effects of prolonged captopril treatment in the chronic phase of this model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three-week-old male CD(1) mice were infected with CB(3) and then randomized to receive placebo or captopril starting on day 7 of infection. Captopril, 2 g/L, was given as the drinking water daily for up to 6 months. Autopsies were performed at 6 and 10 months. Heart-to-body weight ratios were obtained, and deaths were tallied. Myocardial fibrosis was graded according to a score system. In addition, picrosirius red stain (PSR) also was used for assessment of collagen deposition. Mean heart weights were similar in both groups. Mean body weight was significantly lower in captopril-treated mice (40.7 g) than in the untreated group (43.6 g) at 6 months (P =.0155), and mortality was higher (8.7 vs 0.87%; P =.009). At 6 months, the mean myocardial fibrosis score in treated mice (0.12) was significantly less than in untreated animals (0.35; P =.035). With PSR, the mean myocardial fibrosis score in the captopril group (1.20) was also significantly less than in the untreated group (1.58; P =.045). At 10 months, fibrosis scores were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic captopril treatment in CB(3) myocarditis reduces myocardial fibrosis.", 
    "265": "BACKGROUND: Various angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are known to improve heart function and prolong survival in patients and animals after myocardial infarction. Because myocardial infarction is known to induce arrhythmias, this study tested the hypothesis that early treatment with the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor imidapril reduces mortality during acute myocardial infarction because of protective effects against arrhythmogenesis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham control, myocardial infarction, sham plus imidapril, and myocardial infarction plus imidapril. Myocardial infarction was produced by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Treated rats received imidapril (1 mg/kg/day) through a gastric tube beginning 1 hour after coronary occlusion; control rats received tap water. Electrocardiogram (ECGs) were recorded 1, 3, 7, and 21 days postocclusion. Infarct size and scar weight were determined at 21 days in the myocardial infarction groups with and without imidapril treatment. ECGs of untreated rats showed ST-segment changes, abnormal Q waves, premature ventricular complexes, and QT(c) prolongation 1-21 days after coronary occlusion. Total mortality in 21 days averaged 35% in untreated rats; mortality within 48 hours was 30%. On the other hand, imidapril-treated rats showed fewer ST-segment changes, fewer abnormal Q waves, and a decreased incidence of premature ventricular complexes after coronary occlusion; the ST-segment and QT(c) interval returned to basal values within 1 week after occlusion. Imidapril treatment did not affect the ECG pattern in sham-treated control animals. Total mortality in the imidapril-treated group in 21 days after infarction was 22.5%; mortality within 48 hours was 20% (P <.05 compared with the untreated infarction group). Infarct size and scar weight caused by coronary occlusion did not differ in the untreated and imidapril-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Early treatment with imidapril markedly decreases mortality in rats after acute myocardial infarction. The lower mortality is not associated with a decrease in infarct size but is consistent with a protective effect of the drug against arrhythmogenesis.", 
    "266": "The effects on the responses to coronary artery occlusion of a combined ACE/NEP inhibitor (Z13752A) were examined in anaesthetized dogs. A 1 h infusion of Z13752A (128 microgram kg(-1) min(-1) intravenously) decreased arterial blood pressure (by 11+/-3%; P<0. 05) and increased coronary blood flow (by 12+/-4%, P<0.05). There were no other significant haemodynamic changes. Z13752A inhibited both NEP and ACE enzymes both in dog plasma and in tissue (lung ACE; kidney NEP). Pressor responses to angiotensin I in vivo were inhibited and systemic vasodilator responses to bradykinin were potentiated. When the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 25 min, Z13752A markedly reduced the severity of the resultant ventricular arrhythmias. No ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred (compared to 7/16 in the controls; P<0.05), and ventricular tachycardia (VT) was reduced (VT in 2/9 dogs treated with Z13752A cp. 16/16 of controls; episodes of VT 0.2+/-0.1 c.p. 10.7+/-3.3; P<0. 05). Reperfusion of the ischaemic myocardium led to VF in all control dogs but occurred less frequently in dogs given Z13752A (survival from the combined ischaemia-reperfusion insult 67% c.p. 0% in controls; P<0.05). Z13752A reduced two other indices of ischaemia severity; epicardial ST-segment elevation and inhomogeneity of electrical activation. These protective effects of Z13752A during ischaemia and reperfusion were abolished by the administration of icatibant (0.3 mg kg(-1), i.v.) a selective antagonist of bradykinin at B(2) receptors; the ischaemic changes in dogs given both icatibant and Z13752A were similar to those in the controls. We conclude that this ACE/NEP inhibitor is effective at reducing the consequences of coronary artery occlusion in this canine model and that this protection is primarily due to potentiation of released bradykinin.

Although such numbers represent only about 1% of the estimated 60 million Americans with hypertension, hypertensive crisis often constitutes a major medical emergency, necessitating a focused, assertive, and reasoned therapeutic intervention. When such patients are seen in the emergency department or in a physician's office with a critical elevation in blood pressure (BP), appropriate and efficacious management is essential to avoid catastrophic injury to vital target organs, including the central nervous system, the heart, and the kidneys. Delays in initiating effective therapy or, equally important, overzealous therapy leading to a too-rapid reduction in BP can produce severe complications involving these target organs. This article reviews the spectrum of clinical syndromes that comprise hypertensive emergencies, highlighting 2 to illustrate the complexities of clinical presentation and management.

The prevalence of hypertension varies from a small percentage among individuals in their teens and 20s to more than 70% of the elderly (those > 75 years of age). The US Public Health Services (USPHS) has set a goal of having 50% of individuals with hypertension \"under control\"--that is, reducing their BP to < 140 mm Hg systolic and < 90 mm Hg diastolic--by the year 2000. Current information suggests that we will fall far short of reaching that goal. In the early 1990s, such levels had been achieved by only 27% of hypertensive Americans 18 to 74 years old and by only 20% of those > 75 years old. Is this a cause for concern? Is the goal defined by the USPHS justified? Should we push even harder to reach that goal, should we strive to do even better, or should we be satisfied? Since we are now in the era of evidence-based medicine, the only way to answer these questions is to review what we have learned from the many large, prospective, well-controlled, long-term clinical trials that have addressed these questions over the past 3 decades.",

Among the 47 hypertensives, 24 cases were received lotensin and 23 nitrendipine. The plasma fibrinogen was increased and platelet aggregation enhanced in hypertensive patients before treatment. Platelet aggregation decreased after 8 weeks of treatment with lotensin or nitrendipine respectively. Lotensin decreased plasma fibrinogen whereas nitrendipine did not.

    "271": "We investigated the profound involvement of chymase, an alternative angiotensin II-generating enzyme, in angiogenesis using a hamster sponge implant model. In vivo transfection of human pro-chymase cDNA or a direct injection of purified chymase into the sponges implanted resulted in marked increment of hemoglobin contents in the sponge granuloma tissues, demonstrating that chymase has an ability to elicit angiogenesis and is a potent angiogenic factor. Daily injection of basic fibroblast growth factor into the sponges implanted also induced angiogenesis, which was suppressed by the treatment with chymostatin, an inhibitor of chymase, or TCV-116, an antagonist of angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor. Expression of chymase mRNA and production of Ang II in the granuloma tissues were enhanced by the stimulation with basic fibroblast growth factor. Chymase activity in the sponge granulomas increased in parallel with the rise in hemoglobin contents, and mast cells observed in the granuloma tissues were positively stained with anti-chymase antibody. Exogenous administration not only of Ang II but of angiotensin I (Ang I) directly into the sponges could enhance angiogenesis. Chymostatin inhibited the angiogenesis induced by Ang I but not Ang II, suggesting the presence of a chymase-like Ang II-generating activity in the sponge granulomas. Our results may suggest a potential ability of chymase to promote angiogenesis through the local chymase-dependent and angiotensin-converting enzyme-dependent Ang II generating system in pathophysiological angiogenesis.",

This substitution increases the resistance of the inhibitor to degradation without altering potency. In the present study, we investigated the effects of JA2 (5 mg/kg) on the responses of mean arterial pressure to bradykinin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II in conscious rabbits. The depressor responses to both low (10 ng/kg) and high (100 ng/kg) doses of bradykinin were increased 7.0+/-2. 7-fold and 1.5+/-0.3-fold, respectively, during the 30 minutes after JA2 administration (mean+/-SEM, n=8). Bradykinin potentiation was undiminished 4 hours after JA2 injection. In contrast, the hypertensive effects of angiotensins I and II were unaltered, indicating that the bradykinin-potentiating effects were not due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. These data suggest that JA2 is not only a potent and specific inhibitor of EP24.15 and EP24. 16 but is also stable in vivo. Furthermore, the potentiation of bradykinin-induced hypotension by JA2 suggests for the first time a role for one or both of these peptidases in the metabolism of bradykinin in the circulation.",

To evaluate the dose-response relation between this pharmacological interference and dependent edema, a frequent side effect of CCBs during antihypertensive treatment, skin blood flow (laser Doppler flowmetry) at the dorsum of the foot, both supine and with the limb passively placed 50 cm below the heart level, and leg weight (Archimedes principle) were measured at baseline, during increasing doses of the dihydropyridine amlodipine (5 and 10 mg UID each for 2 weeks), and after drug withdrawal in 10 hypertensive men. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may attenuate ankle swelling by CCBs, those parameters were evaluated according to a similar design during amlodipine (10 mg UID) and enalapril (20 mg UID) combined (n=10). As a control, the effect of enalapril monotherapy (10 and 20 mg UID for 2 weeks each) was evaluated in a third series of patients (n=8). Amlodipine (5 mg UID) increased leg weight without modifying postural vasoconstriction (the percent skin blood flow decrease from horizontal to dependent position), which indicates that extravascular fluid shift was independent of postural skin vasoconstriction. At 10 mg UID, however, amlodipine blunted postural vasoconstriction and increased leg weight further, which suggests that skin blood flow autoregulation limited additional fluid transfer. Both parameters normalized after drug withdrawal. Enalapril per se did not affect cutaneous vasomotion or leg weight but reduced the amount of dependent fluid extravasation by the CCB despite a persistent antagonism for postural vasoconstrictor responses.",

We have investigated the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in the control of sodium appetite. Our studies indicate that CCK is effective at reducing saline intake. We found that exogenous, intraperitoneal CCK octapeptide suppresses saline intake. Moreover, administration of trypsin inhibitor to stimulate endogenous CCK release resulted in suppression of saline intake. Finally, intraperitoneal administration of the CCK receptor antagonist lorglumide resulted in increased saline intake.

After infarction, the action potential amplitude was reduced and this phenomenon was partially reversed by metoprolol- and ramipril-treatment.

    "291": "Cardiac angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) may play an important role in regulating cardiac hypertrophy. Angiotensin II (Ang II) stimulates cardiac hypertrophy as well as the production of extracellular matrix. However, it is still unclear whether Ang II exerts a direct effect on cardiac hypertrophy independent of its effect on blood pressure or the circulating renin-angiotensin system. Although ACE inhibitors and/or Ang II receptor antagonists have regressed cardiac hypertrophy, classic pharmacological experiments cannot exclude the contribution of hemodynamics and the circulating renin-angiotensin system. In vivo gene transfer provides the opportunity of assessing the effects of increased cardiac angiotensin in the intact animal without circulating angiotensin or blood pressure. Therefore, we used a \"gain of function\" approach to obtain local overexpression of cardiac ACE. Transfection of the human ACE vector into rat myocardium resulted in a significant increase in cardiac ACE activity (P<0.01). More interestingly, morphometry at 2 weeks after transfection revealed a significant increase in the thickness and areas of cardiac myocytes in hearts transfected with the ACE vector (P<0.01). In addition, transfection of the ACE vector also resulted in a significant increase in collagen content (P<0.01). This increase in cardiac hypertrophy was abolished by the administration of perindopril. Local transfection of the ACE vector into the heart did not result in systemic effects such as increased blood pressure, heart rate, or serum ACE activity. In summary, we have demonstrated that increased autocrine/paracrine angiotensin can directly cause cardiac hypertrophy independent of systemic factors and hemodynamic effects. This approach has important potentials for defining the role of autocrine/paracrine substances in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "292": "The hypertensive fawn-hooded (FHH) rat develops progressive albuminuria (UalbV) and focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS). Early-onset angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition (ACE-i) completely prevented the development of hypertension, UalbV, and FGS. ACE-i was still effective when the start of treatment was delayed, albeit less than early-onset treatment. In this study, we examined whether more advanced renal damage reduces the efficacy of ACE-i, and, if so, which factors dampen the efficacy. ACE-i was started in 36-week-old FHH rats, and follow-up consisted of regular assessment of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and UalbV. Untreated rats, matched for age, SBP, and UalbV, served as controls. In separate groups, untreated or treated with ACE-i from either week 7 or week 36, glomerular hemodynamics and FGS were determined at week 40. ACE-i normalized SBP and markedly reduced UalbV. The Initial UalbV response to ACE-i was inversely correlated with pretreatment UalbV, but despite control of SBP, UalbV rose again. Eventually, rats died of terminal renal failure. Life expectancy was significantly increased in treated rats. In both untreated and treated rats, there was a significant inverse correlation between baseline UalbV and survival time. However, the gain in survival time decreased when pretreatment UalbV was higher. Late-onset ACE-i reduced glomerular capillary pressure to the same extent as early-onset ACE-i. There was a significant linear correlation between FGS and UalbV. We conclude that in FHH rats with advanced renal damage, ACE-i slows down the progression to terminal renal failure. The outcome is an increased survival time that is inversely correlated with baseline UalbV.", 
    "293": "Regardless of the primary cause, progressive renal deterioration with sclerosis is a hallmark of many renal diseases. Several studies have shown the superiority of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors compared with other antihypertensive agents in providing protection from progressive renal deterioration. Furthermore, animal studies have shown that angiotensin II antagonists in excess of antihypertensive doses can also ameliorate or reverse glomerulosclerosis, leading to the hypothesis that angiotensin II has nonhemodynamic effects that mediate the renoprotective effects shown in these investigations. Although historically angiotensin II has been associated with salt and fluid homeostasis, recent data show that angiotensin II induces cell growth and matrix accumulation in glomerular cells. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 has been shown to be the major inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase-like plasminogen activator, with potentially important effects not only on thrombosis/fibrinolysis, but also on matrix degradation because of the proteolytic actions of these substances. Angiotensin II has been shown to influence the actions of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and, consequently, its thrombotic and sclerotic effects. Various studies, both in vitro and in vivo, have shown that direct hemodynamic actions, modulation of endothelial injury, and growth factor actions also may be important in the development of sclerosis. These factors can be directly modulated by angiotensin II inhibition. Sclerosis may even be reversed when therapies augment matrix degradation processes, both by directly increasing proteolytic activity and by downregulating inhibitors of matrix degradation. These observations indicate that angiotensin II is important in fibrotic as well as thrombotic renal injuries that lead to progressive renal disease and also in the development of therapies such as specific angiotensin receptor antagonists to prevent or reverse these conditions.",

The sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost-effectiveness depends on compliance, effect of benefit and the cost of drug therapy. Changes in the compliance rate from 67% to 51% could result in a swing in cost-effectiveness from a savings of $899 to an expenditure of more than $1 million per additional QALY.

The adult fast character and a Ca2+-inducible reversible transition from a fast to a slow type of rabbit myotube in a primary culture were demonstrated at the mRNA level by Northern blot analysis with probes specific for different myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms and enzymes of energy metabolism. 2. No non-adult MyHC isoform mRNA was detected after 22 days of culture. After 4 weeks of culture the fast MyHCIId mRNA was strongly expressed while MyHCI mRNA was virtually absent, indicating the fast adult character of the myotubes in the primary skeletal muscle culture. 3. The data show that a fast-to-slow transition occurred in the myotubes at the level of MyHC isoform gene expression after treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187. The effects of ionophore treatment were decreased levels of fast MyHCII mRNA and an augmented expression of the slow MyHCI gene. Changes in gene expression started very rapidly 1 day after the onset of ionophore treatment. 4. Levels of citrate synthase mRNA increased and levels of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA decreased during ionophore treatment. This points to a shift from anaerobic to oxidative energy metabolism in the primary skeletal muscle culture cells at the level of gene expression. 5. Withdrawal of the Ca2+ ionophore led to a return to increased levels of MyHCII mRNA and decreased levels of MyHCI mRNA, indicating a slow-to-fast transition in the myotubes and the reversibility of the effect of ionophore on MyHC isoform gene expression.",

To further test this hypothesis, male NIH Swiss mice were pretreated intracerebroventricularly with rabbit antisera to opioid peptides or with various inhibitors of peptidases involved in the degradation of EOPs. Mice were subsequently exposed to three different concentrations of nitrous oxide in oxygen, and their antinociceptive responsiveness was measured using the acetic acid abdominal constriction test. Nitrous oxide antinociception was significantly attenuated by 24-h pretreatment with antisera to various fragments of dynorphin (DYN) but not by antisera against methionine-enkephalin (ME) or beta-endorphin (beta-EP). In other experiments, nitrous oxide antinociception was significantly enhanced by 30-min pretreatment with phosphoramidon, an inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11, which has been implicated in DYN degradation, but not bestatin or captopril, which inhibit aminopeptidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme, respectively. The latter enzymes have been implicated in degradation of certain EOPs albeit not DYN.

We examined acute effects of intracoronary enalaprilat on metabolic coronary vasodilation during pacing tachycardia in patients. Coronary blood flow (Doppler guidewire) and diameter (quantitative angiography) were measured in seven patients with DCM and seven control subjects. In the DCM group, tachypacing increased coronary blood flow by 37 +/- 22% from the baseline before enalaprilat and by 65 +/- 22% (p < 0.01 vs. before treatment) after enalaprilat (0.5 microg/kg/min for 5 min, i.c.) at comparable double product. Pacing-induced dilation of the epicardial coronary artery also was greater after enalaprilat (p < 0.05). Effects of enalaprilat on coronary blood flow and diameter during pacing tachycardia were abolished by pretreatment with intracoronary administration of the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitor, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine. These beneficial effects of enalaprilat on large and small coronary vasodilation were not observed in control patients. Thus, intracoronary enalaprilat acutely augmented dilator responses of the large and small coronary arteries to pacing tachycardia in patients with DCM, and NO appeared to play an important role in mediating the effects of enalaprilat. These favorable effects of enalaprilat on the coronary circulation may be of clinical significance in patients with heart failure due to nonischemic DCM. Further long-term studies of the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition on coronary vasodilation will be needed in this population.", 
    "318": "Our previous study found that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and amlodipine induce NO release from coronary microvessels through a kinin-dependent mechanism. The goal of this study was to determine whether amlodipine could potentiate NO formation during ACE inhibition. Coronary microvessels were isolated from 16 mongrel dogs. Nitrite, the hydration product of NO, from coronary microvessels was quantified by using the Griess reaction. Bradykinin and kallikrein all significantly increased nitrite release from coronary microvessels in a concentration-dependent manner. The ACE inhibitor, ramiprilat, potentiated these effects. Amlodipine also markedly potentiated nitrite production by ramiprilat. For instance, amlodipine (10(-10) M) enhanced nitrite release induced by ramiprilat (10(-7) M) from 122 +/- 9 to 168 +/- 14 pmol/mg (p < 0.05 vs. ramiprilat). Nitrite release potentiated by ramiprilat and amlodipine was entirely blocked by N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, an inhibitor of NO synthase), HOE 140 (Icatibant, a specific B2-kinin receptor antagonist), and dichloroisocoumarin (DCIC, a serine protease inhibitor that blocks local kinin formation). These results clearly show that there is a synergistic effect on NO formation when amlodipine is combined with ACE inhibition. Our data suggest that kinin-mediated coronary NO production may contribute importantly to the beneficial therapeutic action of ACE inhibitors, especially in combination with amlodipine in the treatment of heart disease.",

If the affected kidney functions poorly on captopril renography, angioplasty is usually not applicable and seldom leads to a blood pressure response.", 
    "328": "Hypertension in renal allograft recipients is a common problem arising from multiple factors, including peripheral vascular damage caused by pretransplant hypertension, side effects of immunosuppressive medications, allograft dysfunction, renal artery stenosis, recurrent glomerulonephritis, synthesis of vasoconstrictive hormones by the native kidneys, and excessive dietary salt intake. Identification of modifiable factors causing hypertension and concurrent medical conditions, and measurement of glomerular filtration rate, cyclosporine/tacrolimus blood levels, and magnitude of proteinuria are essential to tailor treatment for an individual patient. Lifestyles that exacerbate hypertension should be modified. For pharmacological therapy, diuretics and calcium channel blockers are first-line agents in patients on cyclosporine shortly after transplant. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are good choices for patients with significant proteinuria. Reduction of immunosuppression will improve hypertension in some patients, but entails a potential risk of rejection or graft loss. Angioplasty is necessary in patients with a functionally significant stenosis of the allograft renal artery. Other patients on maximal medical therapy may benefit from native nephrectomy.",

Forearm vasculature endothelial function was assessed by bilateral forearm venous occlusion plethysmography using acetylcholine and N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), with sodium nitroprusside as a control vasodilator. Also, vascular ACE activity was assessed by use of angiotensin (Ang) I, with Ang II as a control vasoconstrictor. Spironolactone significantly increased the forearm blood flow response to acetylcholine (percentage change in forearm blood flow [mean+/-SEM], 177+/-29% versus 95+/-20%, spironolactone versus placebo; P<0.001), with an associated increase in vasoconstriction due to L-NMMA (-35+/-6% versus -18+/-4%; P<0.05).

    "332": "Thirty-nine hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were followed under long-term treatment (mean, 20.7 months) with manidipine hydrochloride, a Ca antagonist, or delapril hydrochloride, an ACE inhibitor, at nine institutions. Both the treatments showed similar antihypertensive effects, although slight but significantly larger decreases were observed in systolic and mean blood pressures at months 12 and 24 in the patients treated with manidipine (P < 0.02). The urinary albumin excretion index (AEI) tended to increase throughout the study in both treatment groups, but no significant difference in AEI was observed between the two treatment groups at any time point. Overt albuminuria developed in four patients on manidipine but did not appear in any of the patients on delapril. The risk of progression to overt albuminuria was significantly different between manidipine and delapril groups (P = 0.011). No increase in serum creatinine (Cr) was observed with delapril. The average excretion indexes of tubular markers such as beta2-microglobulin, alpha1-microglobulin, and NAG tended to be higher in the patients on manidipine than in those on delapril. Taken in sum, these findings suggest that the ACE inhibitor delapril is more beneficial than the Ca antagonist manidipine in the treatment of diabetic renal diseases via mechanisms other than the blood pressure regulation, partly through their different effects on tubular function. In conclusion, delapril was significantly more effective than manidipine in inhibiting progression to overt albuminuria in hypertensive type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.",

Consequently, the question arose about whether such tissue-based systems might be differentially influenced by angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with distinct physicochemical properties. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate how the membrane penetration of various ACE inhibitors depends on their lipophilia. All diacid forms of ACE inhibitors are dissociated at a pH of 7.4 and scarcely extractable into octanol (extraction coefficient < 10%). In contrast, the extraction coefficients of the parent substances showed marked differences in the following order of increasing lipophilia: enalapril = perindopril < captopril = ceranapril < ramipril < quinapril < HOE288 = zofenopril < fosinopril < HOE065. For selected substances, the kinetics of diffusion through a monolayer of cultured bovine aortic endothelium were determined. The diffusion rates (expressed as half lives) of captopril (59.6 min), enalapril (53.4 min), enalaprilat (50.8 min), ramipril (56.9 min) and ramiprilat (51.1 min) are similar indicating: 1) that penetration is independent on lipophilia and 2) that endothelium constitutes no specific barrier for the passage of ACE inhibitors into the vessel wall.",

The authors report a patient with Takayasu's arteritis who had been unilaterally nephrectomized and presented with malignant hypertension due to renal artery stenosis. Hypertension was refractory to conventional antihypertensive treatment, and stenosis was not accessible by interventional angioplasty. Initiation of enalapril and losartan therapy was successful in improving blood pressure without deterioration of renal function due to ischemic failure. Antihypertensive treatment resulted in dramatically stimulated endogenous nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, while elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels were unchanged. Renovascular hypertension in Takayasu's arteritis is associated with an imbalance of vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 and vasodilator peptide NO. Successful treatment of hypertension by enalapril or losartan results in improved endogenous NO synthesis, which putatively counterbalances excessive vasoconstrictor actions and may retard the progression of renal failure.",

Thus, ACE-inhibition should be part of standard treatment in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with left ventricular dysfunction. In symptomatic patients with chronic heart failure, combination therapy of an ACE-inhibitor with digitalis and diuretics is state of the art and improves symptoms significantly. The addition of a vasodilatator can be considered in selected cases. Based on recently published data on beta-adrenoreceptor-blockade in the treatment of chronic heart failure, beta-blockers seem to get part of standard therapy of heart failure in the present and near future (2, 44, 50, 60). In spite of innovations of modern heart failure therapy prognosis is still bad. Survival after diagnosis of severe heart failure (functional class NYHA III and IV) is limited to a mean of 14 month.", 
    "353": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Tissue factor (TF), the initiator of blood coagulation, plays a pivotal role in arterial thrombosis that occurs after atherosclerotic plaque fissuring. Because monocytes synthesize TF and contain several components of the renin-angiotensin system, we investigated the possibility that ACE inhibitors could modulate monocyte TF expression. Mononuclear leukocytes from healthy volunteers were incubated with endotoxin in the presence or absence of different ACE inhibitors. Captopril reduced TF expression in endotoxin-stimulated mononuclear leukocytes, as measured by a 1-stage clotting assay and ELISA analysis, by approximately 60%. The effect was dose-dependent and was attributable to ACE inhibition, given that other ACE inhibitors, such as idrapril or fosinopril, and losartan, an antagonist of the angiotensin II AT(1) receptor, caused a comparable reduction in TF activity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction indicated that endotoxin-mediated increased levels of TF mRNA were inhibited by ACE inhibitors. Moreover, endotoxin-induced nuclear factor-kappaB translocation to the promoter region of the gene encoding for TF was markedly inhibited by captopril. The finding that ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II AT(1) antagonists can potentially modulate TF expression by mononuclear cells has important biological and therapeutic implications for the evolution of thrombi. Our results suggest that the anti-ischemic effect of these drugs might be explained, at least in part, by their ability to reduce TF expression in monocytes.",

Two months after MI, rats were randomly treated with vehicle or the ACEI ramipril for 2 mo. Brown Norway rats (BN), which have normal kininogen, were used as controls. Left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), end-diastolic pressure (EDP), and ejection fraction (EF) as well as myocardial infarct size (IS), interstitial collagen fraction (ICF), cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area (MCA), and oxygen diffusion distance (ODD) were measured. We found that 1) cardiac hemodynamics, function, and histology were the same in sham-ligated BN and BNK rats; 2) IS was similar in BN and BNK; 3) in rats with HF treated with vehicle, the decrease in LVEF and the increase in LVEDV, LVESV, LVEDP, ICF, MCA, and ODD did not differ between BNK and BN; and 4) ACEI increased EF, decreased LVEDV and LVESV, and improved cardiac remodeling in BN-HF rats, and these effects were partially blocked by the bradykinin B(2) receptor antagonist icatibant (HOE-140). In BNK-HF rats, ACEI failed to produce these beneficial cardiac effects. We concluded that in rats, lack of kinins does not influence regulation of normal cardiac function, myocardial infarct size, or development of HF; however, kinins appear to play an important role in the cardioprotective effect of ACEI, since 1) this effect was significantly diminished in kininogen-deficient rats and 2) it was blocked by a B(2) kinin receptor antagonist in BN rats.", 
    "359": "An early feature of paraquat (PQ) toxicity is the influx of inflammatory cells, releasing proteolytic enzymes and oxygen free radicals, which can destroy the lung epithelium and result in pulmonary fibrosis. Therefore, the ability to suppress early lung injury seems to be an appropriate therapy of pulmonary damage before the development of irreversible fibrosis. Here I show curcumin confers remarkable protection against PQ lung injury. A single intraperitoneal injection of PQ (50 mg/kg) resulted in a significant rise in the levels of protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), alkaline phosphatase (AKP), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), and neutrophils in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), while a decrease in glutathione levels. In paraquat rats bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell TBARS concentration was increased with a simultaneous decrease in glutathione content. In addition, the data also demonstrated that PQ caused a decrease in ACE and glutathione levels and an increase in levels of TBARS and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung. Interestingly, curcumin prevented the general toxicity and mortality induced by PQ and blocked the rise in BALF protein, ACE, AKP, NAG TBARS and neutrophils. Similarly, curcumin prevented the rise in TBARS content in both BAL cell and lung tissue and MPO activity of the lung. In addition, PQ induced reduction in lung ACE and BAL cell and lung glutathione levels was abolished by curcumin treatment.

Amorphous QHCl samples were prepared by rapid evaporation from dichloromethane solution and by grinding and subsequent heating of the crystalline form. Physical characteristics, including the glass transition temperature and molecular mobility, were determined using differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, powder x-ray diffractometry, polarizing microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. The amorphous form of QHCl, produced by both methods, has a T(g) of 91 degrees C. Isothermal degradation studies showed that cyclization of QHCl occurred at the same rate for amorphous samples prepared by the two methods. The activation energy was determined to be 30 to 35 kcal/mol. The rate of the reaction was shown to be affected by sample weight, dilution through mixing with another solid, and by altering the pressure above the sample. The temperature dependence for chemical reactivity below T(g) correlated very closely with the temperature dependence of molecular mobility. Above T(g), however, the reaction was considerably slower than predicted from molecular mobility. From an analysis of all data, it appears that agglomeration and sintering of particles caused by softening of the solid, particularly above T(g), and a resulting reduction of the particle surface/volume ratio play a major role in affecting the reaction rate by decreasing the rate of removal of the gaseous HCl product.",

Moreover, treatment with taurine reduced the TGF-beta1 mRNA levels in 24- and 30-mo-old rats by 40%. Taurine also completely blocked increases in type I and type IV collagen expression in mesangial cells in response to TGF-beta1. Our results demonstrate a protective role from both converting enzyme inhibitors and taurine in the age-related progressive renal sclerosis.

Renal blood flow was higher, while renal vascular resistance and filtration fraction were lower in Hoe 140-treated rabbits. No difference in glomerular filtration rate was observed. The unexpectedly higher renal perfusion observed in group Hoe cannot be explained by the blockade of the known vasodilator and trophic effect of bradykinin. Our results indicate that in intact kallikrein-kinin system is necessary for the normal functional development of the kidney.",

Sensitivity (67%, 12/18) and specificity (84%, 42/50) increased slightly, but not significantly, after i.v. administration of an ACE inhibitor. Also, the accuracy of quantitative criteria such as acceleration time and acceleration index did not improve after the administration of ACE inhibitor.",

    "381": "We investigated the Ca(2+) signaling pathways of the response to angiotensin II in pleural mesothelial cells and the role of these Ca(2+) signaling pathways in mesothelial cell proliferation. Rat pleural mesothelial cells were maintained in vitro, and the Ca(2+) movement to angiotensin II was evaluated using the fluorescent Ca(2+) indicator fura 2. Furthermore, proliferation of mesothelial cells was assessed using a spectrophotometric 3-(4, 5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrasodium bromide (MTT) assay. Angiotensin II (1 pM-100 microM) induced in mesothelial cells a biphasic elevation of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) that consisted of a transient initial component, followed by a sustained component. Neither removal of extracellular Ca(2+) nor inhibition of Ca(2+) influx by 1 microM nifedipine affected the angiotensin II-induced initial transient elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) in mesothelial cells. Nifedipine did not block angiotensin II-induced sustained elevation of [Ca(2+)](i). Angiotensin II (1 pM-100 microM) had a proliferative effect on mesothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist ([Sar(1), Ile(8)]angiotensin II) inhibited both angiotensin II-induced elevation of [Ca(2+)](i) and proliferation of mesothelial cells. Pertussis toxin did not affect angiotensin II-induced responses. These results suggest that angiotensin II-induced responses to mesothelial cells are extremely dependent on the angiotensin AT(1) receptor coupled with pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein.", 
    "382": "We report a case whose renal failure was due to malignant hypertension and in whom steroid facilitated the recovery of renal function. The patient, a 41-year-old man, was admitted to our hospital because of malaise and macrohematuria. On admission, his blood pressure was 270/160 mmHg. The plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldosterone were markedly elevated. Chest X-ray, echo cardiography and electrocardiogram revealed marked hypertrophy. Hypertensive retinopathy and arteriosclerotic change were noted on ophthalmoscopy. Because of renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen 45.6 mg/dl, serum creatinine 4.9 mg/dl with massive proteinuria and increased FENa, renal biopsy was performed on the 8th clinical day. The specimens showed slight proliferation of mesangial cells with mesangiolysis and interstitial cell infiltration, in addition to marked arteriosclerosis and partial collapse of the glomerular tuft. After the administration of a Ca antagonist and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I), his mean blood pressure decreased to 100-130 mmHg, and urinary protein decreased as well. Nevertheless, renal dysfunction remained unchanged during the following 3 weeks. Thus, prednisolone (PSL, 30 mg/day) was administered on the 22nd clinical day and renal function improved thereafter without a significant change in blood pressure. The improved renal function was maintained after PSL tapered off on the 184th clinical day. It is suggested that PSL might be the therapy of choice in malignant hypertension, when the renal function has not been improved by anti-hypertensive treatment alone.", 
    "383": "A 50-year-old man with WPW syndrome and chronic atrial fibrillation controlled by digoxin exhibited nephrotic syndrome due to membranous nephropathy in 1994. For massive edema resistant to loop diuretics, administration of 2 mg/day of Temocapril, an ACE inhibitor with biliary excretion, was started. It provided marked natriuresis and rapid improvement of massive anasarca. Moreover, 6 months later at the time of writing this report, nephrotic proteinuria has decreased and abnormally depressed Ccr level has elevated. For massive edema resistant to loop diuretics in nephrotic syndrome, Temocapril might bring about a beneficial effect possibly through the induction of natriuresis, which has been suppressed by the over-expression of angiotensin II in tubulointerstitium.", 
    "384": "Hospital mortality from acute myocardial infarction has decreased in the last two decades. Left ventricular dysfunction therefore have been mainly due to ischemia. After extensive myocardial infarction, there are processes of adaptation (remodeling) which result in altered geometry of the left ventricle. The effects of this on neurohormonal systems (organ regulation), on the changed ratio of myocyte mass and collagen content owing to reactive and reparative fibrosis (organ texture) and on the molecular and cellular mechanisms (organ structure) are of crucial importance. Depending on the structural changes, the myocardial contractility decreases. This is associated with an activation of the circulating renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The fundamental knowledge available has led to the therapeutic use of ACE inhibitors in the post-infarct period. This treatment enabled a sustained reduction of mortality in several large-scale randomized studies. The effect of early administration in patients with clinical signs of heart failure and/or left ventricular dysfunction was very much greater compared to unselected controls. Only 17 and 13 patients had to be treated after selection in order to save one life in the AIRE and TREACE Study respectively (NNT: number needed to treat), whereas e.g. in the ISIS-4 study 200 unselected patients had to be treated. In clinical practice, however, this life-saving therapy is only used in every second patient requiring treatment. With consideration of an individual form of treatment (anterior infarction, large infarct area, reinfarction, clinical signs of heart failure as well as arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus), a greater acceptance of evidence-based guidelines is thus desirable. Treatment with a high dose may be expected to be of additional benefit.",

    "386": "We compared trends in the in-hospital management, and 30-day and 1-year mortality in men and women in two cohorts of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction in coronary care units in Israel, in the pre-reperfusion and the reperfusion eras. The first cohort of 5839 consecutive patients (4315 men, 74%) was from the Secondary Prevention Reinfarction Israeli Nifedipine Trial (SPRINT) registry of 1981-1983; the second cohort of 1940 patients (1429 males, 74%) derived from two prospective nationwide surveys conducted in all coronary care units in Israel in January/February 1992 and 1994. The demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with acute myocardial infarction in both periods were comparable. Patients in 1992-94 received aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers and nitrates more frequently than in 1981-83. Thrombolysis, coronary angiography, angioplasty and bypass grafting were not used in 1981-83, whereas in 1992-94 these procedures were used in 45%, 28%, 11% and 4% of men, respectively, and in 39%, 20%, 9% and 3% of women, respectively. The 30-day age-adjusted mortality declined, in men, from 17.0% in 1981-83 to 10.8% in 1992-94 (multivariate-adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0. 69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55 to 0.87), and the cumulative 1-year age-adjusted mortality declined from 24.6% to 16.9% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]=0.70%; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.81). In women, the decline in mortality rates were of similar magnitude, from 24.0% to 15.1% (OR=0.70; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94), and from 33.6% to 21.0% (HR=0.67; 95% CI 0.55 to 0.81), respectively. In both sexes, the decline in mortality was more marked in patients reperfused by thrombolysis and/or mechanical revascularization, but was also evident in non-reperfused patients.", 
    "387": "Despite higher mortality in both periods in women compared to men, the prognosis of men and women with acute myocardial infarction improved considerably during the last decade, with a similar decline in 1-year mortality of approximately 30%. The implementation in daily practice of new therapeutic modalities proven to be effective in clinical trials after acute myocardial infarction, probably played a major role in this favourable outcome in both sexes.", 
    "388": "Through the development of a new chemical strategy, aminophosphinic peptides containing a pseudoglutamyl residue (Glu Psi(PO2-CH2)Leu-Xaa) in the N-terminal position were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of aminopeptidase A (APA). The most potent inhibitor developed in this study, Glu Psi(PO2-CH2)Leu-Ala, displayed a Ki value of 0.8 nM for APA, but was much less effective in blocking aminopeptidase N (APN) (Ki = 31 microM). The critical role of the glutamyl residue in this phosphinic peptide, both in potency and selectivity, is exemplified by the P1 position analogue, Ala Psi(PO2-CH2)Leu-Ala, which exhibited a Ki value of 0.9 microM toward APA but behaved as a rather potent inhibitor of APN (Ki = 25 nM). Glu Psi(PO2-CH2)Leu-Xaa peptides are poor inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (Ki values higher than 1 microM). Depending on the nature of the Xaa residue, the potency of these phosphinic peptides toward neutral endopeptidase 24-11 varied from 50 nM to 3 microM. In view of the in vivo role of APA in the formation of brain angiotensin III, one of the main effector peptides of the renin angiotensin system in the central nervous system, highly potent and selective inhibitors of APA may find important therapeutic applications soon.", 
    "389": "Heart failure (HF) is a progressive process and the objective of treatment should be to prevent progression. Treatment should begin at the stage of asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction (LVD), not only to reduce mortality but also to preserve exercise capacity and quality of life. To prevent clinical progression in patients with asymptomatic LVD or HF, left ventricular remodelling and dilatation must be prevented. The SOLVD prevention trial-the only clinical trial on the prevention of HF-showed that ACE inhibition significantly reduced the development of HF, but did not significantly reduce mortality. Plasma norepinephrine is elevated in patients with asymptomatic LVD, is further elevated in patients with overt HF, and is correlated with increased mortality. Inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system by administration of beta-blocking agents is therefore a logical treatment for patients with HF or asymptomatic LVD. Clinical trials have shown that beta-blocking agents increase left ventricular ejection fraction and reduce left ventricular dimensions in patients with HF, indicating regression of left ventricular remodelling. Almost all the patients in these studies were receiving an ACE inhibitor as part of their background medication, therefore the relative efficacy of beta-blocking agents and ACE inhibitors in the regression of remodelling is not known. CARMEN, a double-blind, randomised, parallel group study of carvedilol versus enalapril versus carvedilol + enalapril in 450 patients with mild HF, will provide this information.", 
    "390": "Hypertension (HT) is a common disease in elderly. It has different pathophysiologic, clinical and therapeutic implications in this age group. Due to loss of arterial wall elasticity with age, major vessels including aorta become stiff and less distensible. As age advances, these stiff vessels also lose beta adrenergic responsiveness with unchanged alpha adrenergic responsiveness. These together raise peripheral vascular resistance and aortic impedance which needs a powerful systolic ejection of left ventricle to maintain cardiac output. Result is rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and increase in left ventricular (LV) mass with compromised cardiac output and renal blood flow. Participation of renin-angiotensin system and kidney in HT pathogenesis in elderly are minimum. Diagnosis of HT in elderly is made if SBP > 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) > 90 mm Hg or is taking antihypertensive medications. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) means SBP > 140 mm Hg with DBP < 90 mm Hg. Measurement of blood pressure (BP) is problematic, mainly due to pseudo HT, postural hypotension and white-coat HT. HT in absence of end organ changes suggest pseudo HT. Postural hypotension must be detected and treated. Systolodiastolic HT, carried over from middle age is the commonest type of HT in elderly. ISH is also common (10%). Atherosclerotic renovascular disease can cause secondary HT. Therapy is always needed in HT in elderly. Chance of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) are quite high amongst elderly hypertensives. SBP is more dangerous than DBP. Benefits of therapy are more when compared to young. HT should be treated if SBP > 160 mm Hg and/or DBP > 90 mm Hg. ISH needs therapy if SBP > 160 mm Hg. The benefits of therapy becomes less after 80 years. Treatment goal should be to keep BP below 140/90 mm Hg. Therapy should be gradual and stepwise. Na-restriction should be modest. Diuretics (e.g., thiazide 25 mg/day) are the drug of choice unless contra-indicated. Beta blockers are inferior agents compared to diuretics unless angina or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is present. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are drug of choice only if congestive cardiac failure (CCF) and/or diabetes is present or other drugs are contra-indicated. Calcium entry blockers (CEB) are new but very good alternative to diuretics in elderly. Due to abnormal physiology, pharmacokinetics and drug interactions, side-effects are very common in elderly. They should be detected early and treated.", 
    "391": "Over the last decade, a great body of evidence has pointed towards the role of kidneys in the genesis and maintenance of a hypertensive state. There exists a relationship between a rise in the blood pressure and a proportionate increase in the urinary excretion of sodium and water called the pressure-natriuresis curve. Chronic renal diseases are the most common causes of secondary hypertension accounting for 2-5% of all cases of secondary hypertension. The prevalence rate of renovascular hypertension based upon referral patterns range from 0.2% to 10% of hypertensive population. The data provided by the International Registries on end-stage renal disease have suggested that essential hypertension is an important cause of progressive renal damage. The pathological lesion observed in malignant hypertension is fibrinoid necrosis of the small arteries and arterioles. Amongst the armamentarium of antihypertensive drugs calcium channel antagonists and the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors have a role in limiting glomerular hypertension. The best modality to prevent and treat renal dysfunction in the presence of hypertension is an adequate and effective control of high blood pressure.", 
    "392": "The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of bradykinin in mediating captopril-induced upregulation of beta-adrenergic receptor (beta-AR). The density of beta-AR on the surface of cardiac myocytes was measured by binding assay using [(3)H]CGP-12177. Treatment of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with captopril resulted in a time-dependent elevation of bradykinin concentration in the culture medium. The increased bradykinin concentration was significant at 2, 3 and 6 h, but not at 12 h after exposure to captopril. This time-dependent effect of captopril on enhancement of bradykinin levels paralleled that of beta-AR upregulation. Exogenously applied bradykinin increased beta-AR density by 22, 30 and 35% at 0.01, 0.1 and 1 microm concentrations, respectively. Myocytes treated with 1 microm bradykinin responded to isoproterenol (ISP) in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated by acceleration of spontaneous beating frequency. These beating acceleration effects of bradykinin were abolished by Hoe 140. Stimulation of bradykinin B2 receptor by exogenously added bradykinin for 6 h was sufficient to produce beta-AR up-regulation to a level similar to that seen after 24 h. Our results indicate that bradykinin potentiation by ACE inhibitors regulates, at least in part, captopril-induced beta-AR up-regulation.", 
    "393": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may participate in the development of cardiovascular remodeling by inhibiting extracellular matrix turnover and fibrinolysis. However, little is known about physiological regulators of PAI-1 in vivo. Angiotensin II has been shown to stimulate PAI-1 in vitro. We previously reported that long-term inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) causes cardiovascular remodeling (vascular medial thickening and fibrosis) associated with increased tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. In the present study, we examined whether treatment with an ACE inhibitor modulates the cardiovascular PAI-1 expression in this model in vivo. Wistar-Kyoto rats were treated with either no drugs, L-NAME (100 mg/kg x day), or L-NAME plus the ACE inhibitor imidapril (20 mg/kg day). Marked increases in PAI-1 mRNA and protein levels in the aorta and left ventricle were observed after the first and fourth weeks of PAI-1 treatment. PAI-1 immunoreactivity was increased in the endothelium and the media of the aorta and coronary arteries after treatment of L-NAME. This increase in PAI-1 levels was associated with an increase in ACE activity of the aorta and left ventricle. ACE inhibition with imidapril significantly prevented both the increases in PAI-1 levels and the development of cardiovascular remodeling. These findings suggest that the local renin-angiotensin system regulates PAI-1 expression, and that the increased PAI-1 levels may contribute to the cardiovascular remodeling in this model.", 
    "394": "The in vivo activation of transcription factors, which is important for cell regulation by gene expression, has not been well examined in myocardial infarcted heart. The purpose of this study was to determine whether myocardial signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is activated as sis-inducing factor (SIF) in infarcted heart, and to assess the angiotensin blockade on SIF activity in ischemic and non-ischemic myocardium of rat. Myocardial infarction was made by ligation of the coronary artery in Wistar rats. In electrophoretic mobility shift assay, myocardial SIF DNA binding activities gradually increased and reached to peak at 1 week in infarcted and non-infarcted regions after myocardial infarction. Imidapril and candesartan cilexitil significantly prevented the increase in SIF DNA binding activity in infarcted and non-infarcted regions. This increased SIF DNA complex was supershifted by specific anti-STAT3 antibody, indicating that increased SIF complex at least contained activated STAT3 proteins in myocardial infarcted heart. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation-Western blot analysis revealed that STAT3 of infarcted and non-infarcted regions were tyrosine-phosphorylated at 1 week after myocardial infarction. Imidapril and candesartan cilexitil prevented the increase in phosphorylated STAT3. Thus, the transcriptional activation of STAT3 through AT1 receptor may be partially involved in cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction.", 
    "395": "Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a key regulator of fibrinolytic pathway and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Because diabetic nephropathy is characterized by the presence of basement membrane thickening and mesangial expansion, we examined the role of PAI-1 gene polymorphisms in the development of type 2 diabetic nephropathy. Evidence also suggested that the PA/plasmin system and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) interact together to affect the risk of fibrosis and thrombosis. Hence, we also studied the synergistic effect between PAI-1 and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene polymorphisms.",

Diabetic patients with coexistence of PAI-1 4G/4G genotype and ACE D alleles had a higher incidence of diabetic nephropathy (22 vs. 7%, P = 0.012) than those with other combinations of genotypes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PAI-1 4G/4G (P = 0.01) and the prevalence of hypertension (P < 0.0001) are independent risk factors of development of type 2 diabetic nephropathy.",

They were subdivided into normoalbuminuric (N = 43), microalbuminuric (N = 34), and macroalbuminuric (N = 25) groups based on two of three 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE) measurements during the run-in period. Renal function was shown by the 24-hour UAE, creatinine clearance (CCr), and the regression coefficient of the yearly plasma creatinine reciprocal (beta-1/Cr).

Moreover, ACE activity increased in A10 cells exposed to PD (10-6 mol/L) together with Ang II (10-7 mol/L), but not with an AT1 antagonist (losartan, 10-6 mol/L). This heightened ACE activity appears functionally relevant because infusion of angiotensin I caused more prompt hypertension in Agtr2-/y mice than in wild-type littermates. Likewise, infusion of bradykinin, also a substrate for ACE, caused significantly less hypotension in Agtr2-/y mice than controls.",

The monogenic hypertensive syndromes manifest dysregulation of the epithelial sodium channel in the cortical collecting tubule. These rare syndromes provide a schema for organizing our thinking about the more common form(s) of low renin hypertension, and raise the possibility that dysregulation of sodium channel activity and consequent salt retention and volume expansion provide a basic pathophysiological mechanism for low-renin hypertension. What are needed are more specific agents to interrupt the mineralocorticoid response pathways, and clinically relevant approaches to measuring sodium channel activity at the level of the collecting tubule in the individual patient. The combined use of aldosterone antagonists and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists could have a beneficial effect on \"progression\" of renal disease associated with glomerular and interstitial fibrosis, especially if the effects of hyperkalemia on the heart and aldosterone secretion can be minimized.", 
    "413": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists improve glucose disposal in diabetes mellitus. We compared the effect of the antihypertensive hybrid drug urapidil [alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist serotonin 1A (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A, 5-HT1A) receptor agonist] on hyperglycemia in streptozotocin diabetic rats with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril. 5-HT1A receptor agonists induce hyperglycemia. This could be an important disadvantage during treatment of diabetes mellitus with urapidil. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (70 mg/kg i.p.). Treatment for 7 days (ramipril 10 mg/kg p.o.; urapidil 20 mg/kg p.o.) significantly decreased mean blood glucose values (urapidil: 15.7+/-0.9 mmol/l, P=0.007; ramipril: 15.0+/-0.8 mmol/l, P=0.038 vs. diabetic control group: 18.7+/-1.0 mmol/l). Both drugs reduced significantly blood pressure, urinary glucose, water consumption, and food requirement. Serotonin concentration in the brain (medulla oblongata, pituitary) was not affected. A normalization comparable with healthy control rats was observed only in a diabetic control group with insulin therapy. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the antihypertensive drug urapidil has no detrimental effect on hyperglycemia compared with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ramipril in experimental diabetes mellitus despite its 5-HT1A receptor agonistic properties.",

Adjunctive vasodilation through calcium channel blockade has been suggested as potentially useful. However, the first-generation calcium channel blockers, including the dihydropyridine nifedipine, showed disappointing results in CHF. The second-generation dihydropyridines were expected to be of more value, and of all the calcium channel blockers, these drugs were the ones most studied in patients with CHF.", 
    "415": "The Medline databank was used to search studies in human beings (published in 1990 or later) that used dihydropyridines in patients with CHF. The references of the studies found were subsequently checked for additional data. In 17 studies and more than 2000 patients with CHF, no consistent beneficial effect was observed with regard to exercise tolerance and functional capacity, whereas plasma neurohormones were not affected. On the other hand, in general, no worsening of CHF was seen with these second-generation dihydropyridines. Two larger studies (PRAISE and V-HeFT III) have given some estimates on the long-term effects of dihydropyridines, and no overall influence on mortality rate was found. Of note, subanalysis of the PRAISE study has suggested that in patients with a nonischemic cause of CHF, amlodipine might have a beneficial effect on survival.",

Pharmacodynamics were assessed by measurement of plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. After single administration of benazepril.HCl, maximum benazepril concentrations were recorded at the first sample (2 h) and declined relatively rapidly with an elimination half life (t1/2) of 1.4 h. Highest benazeprilat concentrations were recorded at the first sample (2 h) in most cats and declined biphasically with half lives of each phase of 2.4 and 27.7 h. With repeated administration, plasma benazeprilat concentrations accumulated slightly with accumulation ratios (R) of 1.46, 1.36 and 1.24 for the 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg dosages of benazepril.HCl, respectively (median value of 1.36 for all dosages). All three dosages of benazepril.HCl caused marked inhibition of plasma ACE activity in all cats. The maximum effect (Emax, % inhibition of ACE as compared to baseline) was > or = 98% after single and 100% with repeated administration. The duration of action of benazepril.HCl was long, with > 87% (single) and > 90% (repeat) inhibition of plasma ACE persisting 24 h after dosing. Benazepril.HCl was well tolerated in all animals.

    "420": "Renal hypertrophy occurs early in diabetes mellitus and precedes the development of glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis. We have previously shown that cultured mesangial cells exposed to high glucose are arrested in the G1-phase of the cell cycle and undergo cellular hypertrophy. High glucose-mediated induction of p27Kip1, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, is essential in this process. Further investigations have also shown that p27Kip1 and p21Cip1, other cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, are up regulated in the kidneys of mice with Type I (insulin-dependent) as well as Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Our study was undertaken to test a potential effect of short-term treatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on the glomerular expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16INK4, p21Cip1, and p27Kip1 in BBdp rats, an autoimmune model of Type I diabetes.",

    "424": "Renal scarring with and without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has been now recognized as an important cause of paediatric hypertension for many years [1-5]. However, its pathogenesis has still remained uncleared. The widespread concept implicated the activation of renin-angiotensin system finding a powerfull support in higher peripheral plasma renin activity (PRA) in children with reflux nephropathy than in controls [6, 7] and in beneficial antihypertensive effects of ACE inhibitors. The latter, in form of captopril, has also been used in captopril test and in renal scintigraphy and isotope renography following the administration of captopril to provide evidence for renin dependent hypertension [8, 9]. Published studies of captopril test have centred on the identification of renovascular as opposed to essential hypertension [10-18, 20-22]. The aim of our study was to assess the usefulness of captopril test in differentiation between hypertensive children with renal scarring from those with essential hypertension. We studied blood pressure (BP) and PRA responses to a single dose of captopril in two groups of hypertensive children. Group A consisted of 29 patients, 14 boys and 15 girls, who had renal scaring as demonstrated by renal 99mTc dimercaptosuccinid acid scan (99m Tc DMSA) and/or intravenous pyelography. Group B included 19 patients, 19 boys and 10 girls who had arterial hypertension, while clinical examination excluded renal and other definable causes of BP elevation, and they were therefore considered to have essential hypertension. At the time of the study all patients had normal glomerular filtration rate and were not salt depleted. They did not receive any antihypertensive medication for at least two weeks. The test was performed in the morning in fasting sitting patients. At the start of the test a small vein in the hand or forearm was cannulated to permit blood sampling. BP was measured 10, 20, and 30 minutes before captopril administration to get baseline BP (mean of these three measurements) and to allow the children to become accustomed to the test procedure. A single oral dose of captopril 0.64 +/- 0.04 mg/kg body weight was given to patients from group A and almost the same dose of captopril, 0.63 +/- 0.05 mg/kg body weight, to patients from group B. The patients remained sitting and BP was measured every 15 minutes during an hour. Blood for PRA was drown in the sitting position (17 patients from group A and 16 patients from group B) before and one hour after the dose of captopril. Samples of blood for basal PRA were collected from 16 patients from group A and in 14 patients from in B in lying position after waking up in the morning. PRA was measured by radioimmunoassay using a commercially available kit, SB-REN 2, from CIS Bio International. According to the criteria of Muller et al. [10] the captopril test was positive if the post-captopril PRA (ng/ml/h) was greater than or equal to 12 with an increase of greater than or equal to 10 and relative increase of greater than or equal to 15% (400% if initial PRA was < 3). The results of our study are presented in Tables 1 and 2 and in Graphs 1 and 2. The age of patients, doses of captopril, initial BP and PRA before the use of captopril did not much differ between studied groups. Fall of BP and PRA increase were highly significant (p < 0.001) both in group A and group B. However, the hypotensive reaction of diastolic BP and MAP were more pronounced in group A (14.45 +/- 1.67% and 15.81 +/- 1.62%) than in group B (6.95 +/- 2.21% and 8.96 +/- 1.75%; p < 0.01), but there were no significant differences in PRA and systolic BP changes and positive results of captopril test between the studied groups. Hypotensive responses of diastolic BP and MAP greater than 10% of initial values were found to be more frequent in group A (79.32% and 79.31%) than in group B (26.61% and 31.57 degrees %; p < 0.001 and p < 0.01).

Rabbits received either placebo (n = 6) or 0.5 mg/kg/day of zofenopril (n = 6). After 6 weeks of treatment, the computer-assisted analysis revealed that zofenopril reduced the aortic and common carotid corrected cumulative lesion area by 34% and 39%, respectively (p < 0.05 vs placebo-treated group). The intimal/medial ratio of the largest fatty streaks was 0.426+/-0.158 in the zofenopril-treated group and 0.875+/-0.238 in the placebo-treated group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we found in the zofenopril-treated group smaller lesions with an intimal/medial ratio of zofenopril also reduced plasmatic LDL oxidation, as shown by significant reduction of malondialdehyde content (p < 0.01) and relative agarose gel mobility (p < 0.05), as well as by the prolongation of the lag-time (p < 0.05). Compared to zofenopril-treated rabbits, arterial sections of the placebo-group had significant increase in the intimal presence of macrophages-derived foam cells (p < 0.05), ox-LDL (p < 0.01), and native LDL (p < 0.01) detected by immunocytochemistry with RAM-11, MDA2 and NP1533975 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. To investigate the amount of platelet accumulation in the atherosclerotic plaque we also measured platelet-associated radioactivity. Autologous platelets were labeled with 111Indiumoxine and injected intravenously. After 2 hours, WHHL were sacrificed and arterial sections were counted for platelet-associated radioactivity. In the placebo-treated group, platelet radioactivity was 0.52+/-0.12 equivalent of radioactivity per mg of tissue in the common carotid and 0.25+/-0.18 in the abdominal aorta; in contrast, rabbits treated by zofenopril had 0.20+/-0.12 in the common carotid and 0.06+/-0.01 in the abdominal aorta. These data indicate that ACE-inhibition with zofenopril has antiatherosclerotic and antioxidant effects in WHHL-rabbits. Our results also shows that these effects could be linked to a reduced wall-associated platelet deposition at the site of atherosclerotic lesions.",

In the placebo-control group diabetes raised the risk of all end points 2- to 3-fold (P< or =.05). However, active treatment reduced the excess risk associated with diabetes to a nonsignificant level (P values ranging from .12-.86) except for cardiovascular mortality (P = .04).

The study examined 8 drug categories: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, antidepressant agents, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, histamine2-receptor antagonists, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The total number of persons with prescriptions in any of the 8 drug classes increased over the 8-year period, with the greatest growth in ACE inhibitors. Mean annual drug use per person declined in Maryland but increased in Washington and Iowa. Despite increasing use, the overall incidence of prescribing problems fell dramatically in all 3 states, particularly for dose- and duration-related criteria. Except in the area of drug-drug interactions, this elderly population was less likely to have received a prescription falling outside commonly accepted drug utilization review criteria for 8 major drug classes in 1996 than in 1989.", 
    "436": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the role of circulating ANG II in mediating changes in systemic and renal hemodynamics, salt and water balance, and neurohormonal activation during the early progression of heart failure. This objective was achieved by subjecting six dogs to 14 days of rapid ventricular pacing (240 beats/min) while fixing plasma ANG II concentration (by infusion of captopril + ANG II) either at approximately normal (days 1-8, 13-14) or at high physiological (days 9-12) levels. Salt and water retention occurred during the initial days of pacing before sodium and fluid balance was achieved by day 8. At this time, cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were reduced to approximately 55 and 75% of control, respectively; compared with cardiac output, reductions in renal blood flow were less pronounced. Although plasma ANG II concentration was maintained at approximately normal levels, there were sustained elevations in total peripheral resistance (to approximately 135% of control), filtration fraction (to approximately 118% of control), and plasma norepinephrine concentration (to 2-3 times control). During the subsequent high rate of ANG II infusion on days 9-12, there were no additional sustained long-term changes in either systemic or renal hemodynamics other than a further rise in right atrial pressure. However, high plasma levels of ANG II induced sustained antinatriuretic, sympathoexcitatory, and dipsogenic responses. Because these same long-term changes occur in association with activation of the renin-angiotensin system during the natural evolution of this disease, these results suggest that increased plasma levels of ANG II play a critical role in the spontaneous transition from compensated to decompensated heart failure.", 
    "437": "The importance of arterial blood pressure (BP) and ANG II for the renal natriuretic response (NaEx) to volume expansion (3.5% body wt) was investigated during converting enzyme blockade (enalaprilate, 2 mg/kg). In separate experiments, BP was clamped either 30 mm Hg above or a few millimeters mercury below baseline by servo-controlled infusion of ANG II or sodium nitroprusside, respectively, so that volume expansion did not change BP. Enalapril decreased BP by 8 mm Hg. Without clamping, volume expansion returned BP to that of preenalapril control and increased NaEx 10-fold (40+/-10 to 377+/-69 micromol/min). During high pressure clamping (133+/-2 mm Hg), peak NaEx after volume expansion was 6% of control experiments. During low pressure clamping, NaEx was 68% of control experiments (45+/-15 to 256+/-64 micromol/min). The results show that 1) in absence of ANG II, volume expansion elicited pronounced natriuresis without increases in BP beyond baseline, 2) in the presence of hypertensive amounts of ANG II, the volume expansion-induced natriuresis was almost eliminated, and 3) nitroprusside prevented the increase in BP but not sodium excretion during volume expansion. ANG II appears to dominate the control of NaEx; however, when absent, volume expansion may still induce marked natriuresis even at constant BP, possibly via nitric oxide-mediated mechanisms.",

Digoxin and diuretics can relieve symptoms but do not affect the mortality rate. Spironolactone in low nondiuretic doses may reduce mortality when added to baseline drug regimens. The proper role of angiotensin II receptor blocking agents has yet to be determined.", 
    "439": "A retrospective study was performed in 48 normotensive proteinuric children to evaluate the effect of enalapril (n = 17), a combination of enalapril and prednisone (n = 11) and prednisone alone (n = 20) on urinary protein excretion and systemic blood pressure. Enalapril treatment was associated with significant and persistent diminution of proteinuria from 1.32 +/- 0.23 to 0.53 +/- 0.11 and 0.44 +/- 0.07 g/day on the 4th and 8th week of treatment, respectively. Combined therapy with enalapril and prednisone resulted in a comparable significant reduction of proteinuria from a pre-treatment value of 2.06 +/- 0.42 to 0.63 +/- 0.22 and 0.52 +/- 0.17 g/day on the 4th and 8th week of treatment, respectively. In contrast to this, in the group treated with prednisone alone, proteinuria decreased significantly only from the 6th week of therapy (p < 0.02). Consequently, these children had significantly higher urinary protein losses at the 4th week of treatment as compared to patients on enalapril treatment (given either alone or combined with prednisone) (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Importantly, the enalapril-induced reduction of proteinuria was unrelated to variations in arterial blood pressure and no significant changes in this parameter were observed. The results indicate that enalapril can be used safety and effectively for symptomatic treatment of proteinuria in normotensive children with preserved renal function. ACE inhibitor provides additive antiproteinuric effect to corticosteroids by accelerating the rate of diminution of proteinuria. Its combination with prednisone may be of particular importance in those cases, where the degree of hypoproteinemia is a concern. (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 29.)", 
    "440": "There are a number of misconceptions that first-year medical students have concerning the pathophysiology of heart failure. These stem from 1) a poor definition of heart failure, 2) a lack of care in distinguishing between similar but distinct concepts, and 3) the inability to recognize the relationship between the various stages of heart failure and the clinical manifestation of the disease. In this paper we provide a list of some of the misconceptions that we have encountered, some explanations of the distinctions to be made, and some of the rationale behind current surgical procedures and drug treatment. The misconceptions include failing to differentiate between the Frank-Starling mechanism and cardiac dilation as well as not grasping the significance that changes in cardiac beta-receptor function have in limiting the positive inotropic actions of circulating catecholamines. Finally, we review some of the altered neurohumoral mechanisms in heart failure and explain the basis for some common therapeutic approaches, including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, in this disease.", 
    "441": "Previous studies have demonstrated that enalapril and verapamil seem to attenuate the cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. However, the mechanisms have not been completely understood, especially on molecular events. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of individual or combined treatment on osteopontin, TGF-beta, endothelin-1 and procollagen alpha 1(I) mRNA expressions. Enalapril (50 mg/L in drinking water) and verapamil (0.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously), alone or in combination, were administered to rats with chronic cyclosporine nephrotoxicity (cyclosporine, 25 mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) (n = 5 each). Five rats treated with olive oil vehicle were used as control. After 4 weeks, biochemical parameters were measured, and renal cortical mRNA levels were evaluated by Northern blot analysis. Cyclosporine reduced renal creatinine clearance significantly and induced renal cortical osteopontin, TGF-beta, endothelin-1 and procollagen alpha 1(I) gene expressions around 13.5 +/- 1.3, 2.4 +/- 0.2, 1.5 +/- 0.1, 1.9 +/- 0.1 folds, respectively. Individual treatment with enalapril or verapamil significantly suppressed the osteopontin and TGF-beta mRNA expression, but not endothelin-1 and procollagen alpha 1(I). Combined treatment also inhibited the osteopontin and TGF-beta mRNA expression but there was no difference between combined and individual treatment. In conclusion, enalapril or verapamil significantly blunted the cyclosporine-induced osteopontin and TGF-beta gene expressions. However, combined treatment did not show any additive effect.", 
    "442": "The objective of the present study was to analyze the influence of the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene on the outcome of microalbuminuria in essential hypertensive patients who were receiving antihypertensive treatment. One hundred thirty-six essential hypertensive patients who were <50 years old and had never previously received treatment with antihypertensive drugs were included in the study. During a 3-year period, patients received nonpharmacological treatment consisting of moderate salt restriction and a low-calorie diet they were obese, with or without a regimen of antihypertensive drugs based on beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors. Hydrochlorothiazide was added when necessary to maintain the blood pressure goal of <135/85 mm Hg. At the beginning of the study and at yearly intervals, systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP and DBP, respectively), 24-hour urinary albumin excretion (UAE), renal function, and biochemical profile measurements were made. The insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined through the use of polymerase chain reaction. The variables used in the statistical analysis were the measurements at the start of the study and the increase or decrease detected during the follow-up, estimated as individual specific regression line slope values. At baseline, no differences in blood pressure or UAE values were observed among genotypes. Likewise, the genotype or allele frequency was not significantly different between normoalbuminurics and microalbuminurics. After the 3 treatment years, significant reductions in SBP, DBP, and UAE were found (SBP 151.6+/-17.3 reduced to 137.2+/-14.3 mm Hg, P<0.001; DBP 96.6+/-8.9 reduced to 84.5+/-9.8 mm Hg, P<0.001; UAE 36.7+/-71.5 reduced to 28.3+/-78.6 mg/24 h, P<0. 05). The slopes of these parameters over time did not differ significantly among genotypes. The slope of SBP was the main factor related to the slope of logUAE (P<0.003). A significant positive correlation coefficient between the SBP and logUAE slopes was observed for the DD patients (r=0.57, P<0.0001) but was absent in patients carrying the I allele (II r=-0.03, P=NS; I/D r=0.01, P=NS). Follow-up studies should be used to achieve a better understanding of the impact of candidate gene polymorphisms on the development of hypertension-induced organ damage. Assessment of the I/D polymorphism of the ACE gene may identify subjects who require a greatly lowered blood pressure to prevent organ damage and to reduce hypertension-associated complications and death.", 
    "443": "Previous data strongly support a role for androgens in promoting the gender difference in hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rat(s) (SHR), but the mechanism is not clear. Because males develop higher blood pressures than do females, we hypothesize that androgens may affect the renin-angiotensin system to promote the development of hypertension in male SHR. The present study was performed to determine the effect of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) on the development of hypertension in SHR. Male, female, castrated male, and ovariectomized (ovx) female SHR (n=10 per gender per treatment group) received enalapril (250 mg/L) in drinking water for 8 to 10 weeks. Some ovx females were also given testosterone chronically. At 17 to 19 weeks of age, 24-hour protein excretion and mean arterial pressure were measured. By 13 weeks of age, male rats had higher systolic blood pressures by tail plethysmography than did the other rats, and CEI reduced blood pressures to similar levels in all groups. At 17 to 19 weeks, the same trend was found by direct measurement of mean arterial pressure. The ovx females treated with testosterone had serum testosterone and blood pressure levels similar to those found in males. CEI reduced mean arterial pressure to similar levels in all gender groups. Untreated males and ovx females given testosterone had significantly higher levels of urinary protein excretion than did the other groups, and CEI had no effect on proteinuria in any of the rats. These data suggest that the development of hypertension in SHR regardless of sex steroids is mediated by the renin-angiotensin system. However, the data further suggest that androgens promote the exacerbation of hypertension in male SHR via a mechanism involving the renin-angiotensin system.",

The aim of this study was to measure insulin sensitivity in rats fed from weaning to adulthood with a low (LSD), normal (NSD), or high (HSD) salt diet. Body weight, carcass lipid content, blood glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, plasma insulin, plasma renin activity, and a glucose transporter (GLUT4) were measured. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was used in 52 anesthetized rats. Body weight was higher in rats on LSD than in those on NSD (P<0.05) or HSD (P<0.001). Percentage fat carcass content was higher (P<0.05) in rats on LSD than in those on NSD. Basal plasma insulin and glucose levels were not altered (P>0.05) by salt consumption. Nonesterified fatty acids were lower in rats on HSD than in those on LSD (P<0.05) or NSD (P<0.01). Glucose uptake was lower in rats on LSD than in those on NSD (P<0.05) or HSD (P<0. 001). When a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp was used on pair-weight rats, similar results were obtained, which suggests that the effect of LSD on insulin sensitivity was not due to higher body weight. GLUT4 in insulin-sensitive tissues was increased in rats on HSD except in the cardiac muscle. Captopril treatment partially reversed low insulin sensitivity in LSD rats, whereas losartan did not change it, which indicates that the effect of LSD on insulin sensitivity is angiotensin independent. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate that chronic dietary salt restriction induces a decrease in insulin sensitivity not associated with renin-angiotensin system activity or body weight changes.", 
    "445": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in animal models and reinfarction rates after myocardial infarction in humans. Although expression of components of the renin-angiotensin system has been reported in human coronary arteries, no data regarding their presence in carotid arteries, a frequent site for the occurrence of atherosclerosis plaques, are available. The following study sought to determine whether ACE mRNA and protein can be detected in human carotid atheromatous lesions. Twenty-four intact endarterectomy specimens were obtained from patients with severe carotid occlusive disease (17 males and 7 females, aged 68+/-1 years) and fixed within 30 minutes. Carotid artery specimens contained advanced Stary type V and VI lesions, and human ACE mRNA expression and protein were localized in cross sections by the combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Cell type-specific antibodies were used to colocalize ACE to smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, macrophages, or lymphocytes. ACE protein was localized in the intima, whereas the overlying media was largely free of ACE staining. In less complicated lesions, ACE staining was modest and could be visualized in scattered clusters of macrophages and on the luminal side of carotid artery vascular endothelium. Smooth muscle cells were largely negative. ACE staining increased as lesions became more complex and was most prominent in macrophage-rich regions. The shoulder regions of plaques contained numerous ACE-positive macrophage foam cells and lymphocytes. In these areas, microvessels were positive for endothelial cell and smooth muscle cell ACE expression. However, microvessels in plaques free of inflammatory cells were stained only faintly for ACE expression. Labeling for ACE mRNA mirrored the pattern of protein expression, localizing ACE mRNA to macrophages and microvessels within the intima. In conclusion, atherosclerosis alters carotid artery ACE production, increasing transcription and translation within regions of plaque inflammation. These data provide another important mechanism by which inflammation associated with increased ACE expression may contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "446": "The results of recent studies have demonstrated that angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) contributes to the antihypertensive actions of either combined ACE/Ang II type 1 receptor blockade or ACE inhibition alone. The vasculature is a key site of action for either drug regimen, and evidence favors a local Ang system within these tissues. Because ACE may degrade Ang-(1-7), we determined whether ACE inhibition alters Ang-(1-7) release from the rat hindlimb perfused with Krebs-Ringer buffer containing Ficoll. Ang-(1-7) release averaged 36+/-13 fmol (period 1, 15-minute collection) and 44+/-11 fmol (period 2) in the control buffer. The addition of the ACE inhibitor lisinopril to the perfusion buffer augmented levels of Ang-(1-7) in periods 3 (144+/-39 fmol) and 4 (163+/-35 fmol; P<0.05 versus 1 or 2, n=8). HPLC and radioimmunoassay of effluent from control or lisinopril treatment demonstrated a single immunoreactive peak with a retention time identical to that of Ang-(1-7). The addition of the neprilysin inhibitor SCH 39370 reduced Ang-(1-7) release in the lisinopril buffer from 177+/-32 (period 1) and 173+/-39 (period 2) fmol to 112+/-24 (period 3) and 87+/-23 fmol (period 4; P<0.05 versus 1 or 2, n=6). Ang I metabolism in the collected perfusate revealed the formation of Ang-(1-7) that was sensitive only to thimet oligopeptidase inhibition; Ang II generation was not detected. The present study demonstrates the recovery of endogenous Ang-(1-7) from the perfused hindlimb. The release of Ang-(1-7) is significantly influenced by inhibition of ACE, which may reflect both increased substrate (Ang I) levels and reduced metabolism of the peptide. Neprilysin inhibition reduced but did not abolish Ang-(1-7) release, which suggests that other endopeptidases may contribute to the release of the peptide.", 
    "447": "In the C57BL/6J mice model, we investigated whether obesity affects the function or expression of components of the tissue renin-angiotensin system and whether endothelin (ET)-1 contributes to these changes. ACE activity (nmol. L His-Leu. mg protein(-1)) was measured in lung, kidney, and liver in control (receiving standard chow) and obese animals treated for 30 weeks with a high-fat, low cholesterol diet alone or in combination with LU135252, an orally active ET(A) receptor antagonist. ACE mRNA expression was measured in the kidney, and the effects of LU135252 on purified human ACE were determined. Aortic and renal tissue ET-1 protein content was measured, and the vascular contractility to angiotensin II was assessed. Obesity was associated with a tissue-specific increase in ACE activity in the kidney (55+/-4 versus 33+/-3 nmol/L) but not in the lung (34+/-2 versus 32+/-2 nmol/L). Long-term LU135252 treatment completely prevented this activation (13.3+/-0.3 versus 55+/-4 nmol/L, P<0.05) independent of ACE mRNA expression, body weight, or renal ET-1 protein but did not affect pulmonary or hepatic ACE activity. Obesity potentiated contractions in response to angiotensin II in the aorta (from 6+/-2% to 33+/-5% KCl) but not in the carotid artery (4+/-1% to 3.6+/-1% KCl), an effect that was completely prevented with LU135252 treatment (6+/-0.4% versus 33+/-5% KCl). No effect of LU135252 on purified ACE was observed. Thus, obesity is associated with the activation of renal ACE in vivo independent of its mRNA expression and enhanced vascular contractility to angiotensin II. These effects are regulated by ET in an organ-specific manner, providing novel mechanisms by which ET antagonists may exert organ protection.", 
    "448": "The justification for clinical investigation has its roots in the fact that physiological mechanisms and disease pathogenesis in animal models replicate mechanisms and pathogenesis in humans only in part. In the case of the renin-angiotensin system, there is species variation in the anatomic distribution of the renin-angiotensin system, in the active site of the renin enzyme, and in the structure of angiotensin and the AT(1) receptor. The conversion of angiotensin I (Ang I) to angiotensin II (Ang II) may prove to be the most important aspect of species variation. In plasma, all the conversion occurs through a single enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and species variation in structure and function have not been reported. Non-ACE-dependent pathways, which occur only at the tissue level, show unambiguous, striking species variation. Specifically, chymase, the most important enzyme responsible for non-ACE conversion of Ang I to Ang II, shows striking species variation. In humans and a number of species, including the hamster, quantitatively important chymase-independent Ang II formation from Ang I occurs in the heart, arteries, and kidney. In rats and rabbits, on the other hand, chymase differs, is not active in the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, and indeed is involved in Ang II degradation. Consequently, one would anticipate that blockade of the system at the ACE step would be equivalent to that at the Ang II receptor in the rat. This has been widely reported. In humans, on the other hand, one would anticipate that the AT(1) receptor blockers will be more effective than ACE inhibitors. Again, preliminary evidence favors this possibility. The implications for therapeutics are clear.", 
    "449": "Inhibitors of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) are very efficacious in the potentiation of the actions of bradykinin (BK) and are able to provoke a B(2) receptor-mediated vasodilation even after desensitization of this receptor. Because this activity cannot be easily explained only by an inhibition of kinin degradation, direct interactions of ACE inhibitors with the B(2) receptor or its signal transduction have been hypothesized. To clarify the significance of degradation-independent potentiation, we studied the vasodilatory effects of BK and 2 degradation-resistant B(2) receptor agonists in the isolated rat heart, a model in which ACE and aminopeptidase P (APP) contribute equally to the degradation of BK. Coronary vasodilation to BK and to a peptidic (B6014) and a nonpeptidic (FR190997) degradation-resistant B(2) agonist was assessed in the presence or absence of the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat, the APP inhibitor mercaptoethanol, or both. Ramiprilat or mercaptoethanol induced leftward shifts in the BK dose-response curve (EC(50)=3.4 nmol/L) by a factor of 4.6 or 4.9, respectively. Combined inhibition of ACE and APP reduced the EC(50) of BK to 0.18 nmol/L (ie, by a factor of 19) but potentiated the activity of B6014 (EC(50)=1.9 nmol/L) only weakly without altering that of FR190997 (EC(50)=0.34 nmol/L). Desensitization of B(2) receptors was induced by the administration of BK (0.2 micromol/L) or FR190997 (0.1 micromol/L) for 30 minutes; the vascular reactivity to ramiprilat or increasing doses of BK was tested thereafter. After desensitization with BK, but not FR190997, an additional application of ramiprilat provoked a B(2) receptor-mediated vasodilation. High BK concentrations were still effective at the desensitized receptor. The process of desensitization was not altered by ramiprilat. These results show that in this model, all potentiating actions of ACE inhibitors on kinin-induced vasodilation are exclusively related to the reduction in BK breakdown and are equivalently provoked by APP inhibition. The desensitization of B(2) receptors is overcome by increasing BK concentrations, either directly or through the inhibition of ACE. These observations do not suggest any direct interactions of ACE inhibitors with the B(2) receptor or its signal transduction but point to a very high activity of BK degradation in the vicinity of the B(2) receptor in combination with a stimulation-dependent reduction in receptor affinity.", 
    "450": "Recent investigations have shown that antihypertensive drug treatment leads to enhanced myocardial beta-adrenoceptor sensitivity. This study was therefore conducted to establish whether or not such hypersensitivity might trigger myocardial arrhythmia subsequent to adrenaline exposure. Adult male Wistar rats (n = 6 per group) were treated with either placebo (vehicle), metoprolol (2.40 mg.kg-1.day-1), timolol (0.075 mg.kg-1.day-1), verapamil (5.50 mg.kg-1.day-1) or enalapril (0.50 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 20 consecutive days. Hearts were excised and perfused ad modum Langendorff in the presence of an adrenaline gradient (0-300 nM) for 20 min with either 3.0 mM or 5.9 mM of potassium in the perfusion buffer. Adrenaline threshold concentration (ATC, nanomolar) at myocardial fibrillation was recorded, as well as tissue cAMP contents, beta-adrenoceptor number, G-protein levels and signalling effector enzyme activities. The main findings were: (1) ATC and cAMP levels were affected in hearts perfused with low-concentration potassium buffer only. In terms of ATC, the beneficial effect of each drug regimen appeared to be in the rank order of: placebo = enalapril > verapamil > timolol > metoprolol. There was an inverse correlation between ATC and myocardial cAMP contents at the start of fibrillation; (2) Subsequent to fibrillation, beta-adrenoceptor number, hormone-elicited adenylate cyclase activities and Gs alpha:Gi2 alpha-ratio were no different from preperfusion values; (3) Significant inverse correlations between beta 1-adrenoceptor numbers and ATC were observed. We conclude that alterations in beta-adrenoceptor number, G proteins and cAMP induced by antihypertensive drugs are predictive of the myocardial sensitivity to adrenaline in terms of time to continuous and irrevocable fibrillation.",

    "459": "The present study investigates the pharmacological activity of the nitric oxide (NO) donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) on the plasma glucose and insulin levels in healthy normoglycemic dogs. The plasma nitrate and nitrite concentrations were measured by a commercial autoanalyzer and taken as the biochemical markers of in vivo nitric oxide formation. Plasma glucose levels were measured by the glucose oxidase method, while the insulin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. The possible effect of the coadministration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and GSNO on plasma glucose levels was also examined. In healthy normoglycemic dogs, administration of 35 and 50 mg/kg of GSNO caused a dose-dependent increase in postprandial plasma glucose levels. The plasma glucose levels were significantly elevated at the 1.5-, 2.0-, and 2.5-h time intervals of the oral glucose tolerance test at both concentrations of GSNO (P < 0.05). These values were significantly higher than those obtained using captopril (control). Furthermore, coadministration of 35 mg/kg of GSNO and 50 mg/kg ascorbic acid enhanced the postprandial hyperglycaemic effect observed for the administration of only 35 mg/kg of GSNO. There was a 35-100% increase in plasma nitrate concentration on administration of both doses of GSNO. Intravenous administration of GSNO (35 mg/kg) and captopril (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased the mean arterial blood pressure and increased the heart rate. The blood pressure-lowering effect of these drugs was more pronounced on systolic than on diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.05). These results suggests that in healthy normoglycaemic dogs: (a) nitric oxide released from GSNO increases postprandial plasma glucose levels and inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, (b) ascorbic acid enhances the postprandial hyperglycaemic effect of GSNO, probably by increasing the release of NO, and (c) GSNO decreases mean arterial blood pressure and increase heart rate in normotensive dogs.", 
    "460": "Until recently, renal crisis was the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with scleroderma (SSc). Nowadays, following the introduction of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors used in renovascular hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension have become the most common causes of death in SSc. Consequently, the early diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary fibrosis is essential to improve morbidity and mortality in SSc patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intravenous cyclophosphamide pulse therapy in patients with SSc and evidence of active alveolitis assessed on a high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scan, and to compare the effect of cyclophosphamide pulse therapy with oral therapy. Sixteen consecutive patients with SSc were allocated alternately to the two treatment groups. Eight patients were treated with monthly cyclophosphamide pulse therapy (750 mg/ m2) for 12 months; the other eight patients were treated with oral cyclophosphamide (2-2.5 mg/kg/day) for the same period. All patients received concurrently prednisone (10 mg/day). Pulmonary function tests and HRCT scans were performed before therapy and at 6 and 12 months. In the oral cyclophosphamide group, three patients with a grade I pattern showed regression of disease extent. In the other five patients (one with grade II and four with grade III) the pattern and extent of disease remained stable during the study. No statistical differences were found in forced expiratory volume in 1 s, forced vital capacity and total lung capacity during the study period. The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide increased significantly between baseline and 12 months (p = 0.043). In the cyclophosphamide pulse therapy group, seven patients with a grade I pattern showed regression of disease extent at 6 months (p = 0.018) and 12 months (p = 0.012). One patient with grade III remained stable during the study. In both groups the regression of the extent of disease estimated on HRCT was due to a decrease in the ground glass appearance. The extent of the reticular appearance remained stable throughout the study. Our results indicate that cyclophosphamide pulse therapy is effective in suppressing active alveolitis (ground glass appearance). Although in this study it is not possible to compare pulse therapy with oral therapy because of the different pattern seen on HRCT between the two groups, it seems that oral therapy is also effective in suppressing active alveolitis. Neither regimen improved pulmonary involvement when the reticular appearance predominated over the ground glass appearance on HRCT. It is concluded that either pulse or oral cyclophosphamide therapy may improve the outcome of SSc patients.",

The tablet was swallowed with 250 ml of water. Fasting continued for additional 4 h after dosing and no other liquid intake was allowed from 1 h before to 2 h after administration. Plasma concentrations of zofenopril and its active metabolite zofenoprilat as well as serum ACE activity were measured before drug intake (baseline) and on timed samples over a 36 h period after dosing by LC-MS-MS, a highly sensitive, validated method for active moiety concentrations. Peak plasma concentration was reached on average at 1.19 h with zofenopril and at 1.36 h with zofenoprilat. Concentrations then decreased reaching values under or close to the limit of quantitation (1 ng.ml-1 for zofenopril, 2 ng.ml-1 for zofenoprilat) from 8 to 16 h after dosing. Complete inhibition of ACE was seen at the first blood sampling time (1 h) and lasted on average up to 9.44 h. ACE activity then slowly reactivated, but enzyme inhibition continued and was estimated to be 74% and 56% at 24 and 36 h following drug administration, respectively.

ACE catalyzes the conversion of Ang I to Ang II, which in turn stimulates the production of PAI-1, sensitizes platelets, promotes the production of superoxide radicals that scavenge free NO, and induces the expression of tissue factor. Conversely, ACE catalyzes the breakdown of bradykinin, a potent stimulus to t-PA secretion.

Angiotensin I (3x10(-9) to 3x10(-6) M) induced a dose-dependent vasoconstriction in control kidneys; this response was completely inhibited by losartan (10(-5) M) and markedly inhibited by both captopril (10(-4) M) and indomethacin (10(-5) M). Angiotensin II (10(-10) to 3x10(-7) M) also caused a dose-dependent vasoconstriction in control kidneys; this response was markedly enhanced by 10(-4) M L-NNA, and significantly inhibited by losartan (10(-5) M). Angiotensin I-induced vasoconstriction was slightly greater in STZ-induced diabetic rats than in controls, but the maximal response was unaffected.

Treatment with ACE inhibitors was associated with a tendency toward reduced hospital admissions that was more evident among patients with greater functional impairment. The adjusted relative rate for hospitalization for any reason was 0.96 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.01). The rate of functional decline was greatly reduced among ACE inhibitor recipients (relative rate, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.80), and this effect was consistent and independent of background comorbidity and baseline physical function.",

    "479": "In the early years after the first description of IgA nephropathy, a nihilistic attitude prevailed in therapy because the initial proposals were not convincing, being both empirical and uncontrolled. The situation now seems to be changing. Although the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy is still not fully understood, a number of drugs--supposed to interfere with some disease mechanisms--have been tested with proper study design. As a consequence, the current therapeutic approach to IgA nephropathy is based on the results of large controlled trials of glucocorticoids, immunosuppressors, anticoagulants, ACE-inhibitors, fish oil, etc., provided that the patients are selected among those with a greater risk for progression. This therapeutic approach, though still empirical, is the mainstay at present. As we approach the new millennium, we are getting tantalizingly closer to understanding the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy and to develop new effective drugs.", 
    "480": "Human chymase forms angiotenin (ANG) I to ANG II, whereas the roles of ANG II generated by chymase and the effects of chymase inhibitors have been unclear. On the other hand, rat chymase could not convert ANG I to ANG II. In isolated rat arteries, the ANG I-induced vascular contraction was completely suppressed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor only. However, 30% of ANG I-induced vascular contraction in isolated human arteries was suppressed by an ACE inhibitor, but the remainder was blocked by chymostatin. In hamster hypertensive models, ANG II formation by ACE, but not by chymase, in vascular tissues plays an important role in maintaining hypertension. ANG II formation also induces vascular remodeling such as neointima formation. After balloon injury of vessels in dog, chymase and ACE activities were significantly increased in the injured vessels. In this model, an ANG II receptor antagonist was effective in preventing neointimal formation after balloon injury of vessels in dog, but an ACE inhibitor was ineffective. In dog grafted veins, the activities of chymase and ACEmin the grafted vein were significantly increased 15- and 2-fold, respectively, compared with those in the symmetrical veins. The intimal area of the grafted vein was reduced by a chymase inhibitor. Therefore, chymase-dependent ANG II formation plays an important role in the proliferative response, and chymase inhibitors may appear useful for preventing vascular proliferation.", 
    "481": "Heart failure is increasing in both incidence and prevalence and is associated with a high mortality. In patients with heart failure, coronary artery disease is the cause for about two thirds. Pathophysiologic changes have been linked to altered muscle function and hemodynamics, elevated neurohormones, and, more recently, cellular mechanisms, including apoptosis. Standard triple therapy for symptomatic heart failure consists of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, digoxin, and a diuretic. In patients with severe heart failure, spironolactone should be added. In large clinical trials, ACE inhibitors, spironolactone, and beta-blockers have reduced mortality. Other drugs may be helpful in the treatment of heart failure. Amiodarone is the antiarrhythmic drug of choice in patients with symptomatic arrhythmias and also has a role in the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are being compared with ACE inhibitors and appear promising. Newer agents being tested include antagonists to endothelin and tumor necrosis factor. Overall, it is clear that polypharmacy is the standard of care for patients with heart failure. A future challenge will be to prevent heart failure from occurring.", 
    "482": "Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of kidney failure in the United States. Poor glycemic control, hypertension, and smoking have been implicated as risk factors for the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Improved medical therapy including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and tight glycemic control with use of intensive insulin therapy have been shown to reduce the progression of diabetic nephropathy substantially based on albumin excretion rates. Despite these improvements in medical management, many patients still experience progression from early diabetic nephropathy to end-stage renal disease. Successful pancreas transplantation leads to normal glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes, but historically it has generally been limited to patients with both kidney failure and diabetes. In this review of the current treatment of diabetic nephropathy, we examine the potential role of preemptive pancreas transplantation in patients with diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "483": "We investigated the mechanism of the antiatherosclerotic effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, in the apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient mice. Mice that received a high dose (5 mg/kg/day) of ramipril supplemented in their drinking water for 10 weeks showed reduced aortic lesion size by 75% compared with placebo-treated mice. At this dosage, ramipril significantly reduced blood pressure from 95+/-5 mm Hg before treatment to 68+/-4 mm Hg at the end of the treatment period. Ramipril also increased the resistance of the mouse low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to CuSO4-induced oxidation, as shown by a prolongation of the lag time required for the initiation of LDL oxidation from 90 min in the placebo-treated mice to >180 min in the ramipril-treated mice. Similarly, a reduction in the maximal LDL-associated conjugated dienes after 180 min of oxidation by 250% in comparison with placebo-treated mice was noted. Ramipril (1 mg/kg/day) that was still adequate to reduce their plasma ACE activity and LDL propensity to lipid peroxidation was insufficient to reduce their blood pressure. This dosage also inhibited the progression of atherosclerosis in the apo E-deficient mice by 74%. The contribution of bradykinin potentiation to the ACE-inhibitor action was assessed by cotreatment of ramipril with the bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist, icatibant (HOE-140, 0.5 mg/kg given subcutaneously twice a day) for a period of 10 weeks. HOE-140 had no effects on ACE activity, LDL lipid peroxidation, blood pressure, or atherosclerosis. In combination with ramipril, no additional effect of HOE-140 on LDL oxidation or on atherosclerosis was noted in comparison with ramipril treatment alone. We thus conclude that the antiatherogenic effect of ramipril in E(0) mice is independent of blood pressure reduction and is not mediated by bradykinin. It seems, therefore, that most of its antiatherosclerotic and antioxidative effects are mediated through the inhibition of angiotensin II production.",

    "488": "S21402 is a vasopeptidase inhibitor that simultaneously inhibits neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This study determined whether chronic treatment with S21402 produced different effects on sodium and water excretion, hormonal parameters, and cardiovascular structure compared with selective inhibition of ACE and NEP in a rat model of myocardial infarction-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). CHF rats received the vasopeptidase inhibitor (S21402, 100 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), an ACE inhibitor (captopril, 50 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), a NEP inhibitor (SCH42495, 60 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)), or vehicle for 4 weeks. S21402 alone caused a diuresis and natriuresis (P<0.01) in CHF. After 4 weeks, blood pressure was lowered by captopril but not other treatments (P<0.01). Both S21402 and captopril increased plasma renin activity (P<0.01), all treatment lowered plasma aldosterone (P<0.05) and plasma natriuretic peptide levels were unchanged. In the kidney, S21402 inhibited NEP and ACE (P<0.01), SCH42495 inhibited NEP (P<0.01), and captopril inhibited ACE (P<0.01). Heart mass was reduced by all active treatments; captopril reduced left ventricular mass (P<0.01), SCH42495 reduced right ventricular mass (P<0.01), and S21402 decreased left (P<0.05) and right ventricular mass (P<0.01), atrial mass (P<0.05), and lung mass (P<0.01). In CHF, vasopeptidase inhibition with S21402 produces effects that differ from those of selective NEP or ACE inhibition. S21402 improved sodium and water excretion, reduced pulmonary congestion, and attenuated both right and left ventricular remodeling. These effects, which occurred in the absence of any hypotensive action, suggest that S21402 may offer several advantages over ACE inhibition alone in the treatment of heart failure.", 
    "489": "Both angiotensin II and vascular endothelial growth factor are angiogenic agents that have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this study, retinal neovascularization was examined in a model of retinopathy of prematurity with the use of neonatal transgenic (mRen-2)27 rats, which overexpress renin in tissues, and Sprague-Dawley rats. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin system were administered during the neovascularization period. The ACE inhibitor lisinopril and the angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist losartan both increased retinal renin levels and prevented inner retinal blood vessel growth. Quantitative in situ hybridization revealed that the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its type 2 receptor in the inner retina and proliferating blood vessels were increased in rats with retinopathy of prematurity. Lisinopril reduced both retinal vascular endothelial growth factor and its type 2 receptor mRNA in retinopathy of prematurity rats, whereas losartan had no effect. It is predicted that agents that interrupt the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role as retinoprotective agents in various forms of proliferative retinopathy.", 
    "490": "Increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity regulate the functions of the nephron, the vasculature, and the renin-containing juxtaglomerular granular cells. Because increased activity of the renin-angiotensin system can also influence nephron and vascular function, it is important to understand the interactions between the renal sympathetic nerves and the renin-angiotensin system in the control of renal function. These interactions can be intrarenal, for example, the direct (by specific innervation) and indirect (by angiotensin II) contributions of increased renal sympathetic nerve activity to the regulation of renal function. The effects of increased renal sympathetic nerve activity on renal function are attenuated when the activity of the renin-angiotensin system is suppressed or antagonized with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II-type AT(1)-receptor antagonists. The effects of intrarenal administration of angiotensin II are attenuated after renal denervation. These interactions can also be extrarenal, for example, in the central nervous system, wherein renal sympathetic nerve activity and its arterial baroreflex control are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system. In addition to the circumventricular organs, whose permeable blood-brain barrier permits interactions with circulating angiotensin II, there are interactions at sites behind the blood-brain barrier that depend on the influence of local angiotensin II. The responses to central administration of angiotensin II-type AT(1)-receptor antagonists into the ventricular system or microinjected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla are modulated by changes in activity of the renin-angiotensin system produced by physiological changes in dietary sodium intake. Similar modulation is observed in pathophysiological models wherein activity of both the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems is increased (eg, congestive heart failure). Thus, both renal and extrarenal sites of interaction between the renin-angiotensin system and renal sympathetic nerve activity are involved in influencing the neural control of renal function.", 
    "491": "We investigated whether an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor increases the production of nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled air in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. In study 1, 8 normotensive male subjects received a single oral dose of enalapril (5 mg) or nitrendipine (10 mg) in a crossover manner. Exhaled air was collected at baseline, and at 2, 4, and 8 hours after administration of the drug. In study 2, 10 normotensive subjects (6 men and 4 women) and 10 hypertensive subjects (6 men and 4 women) received a single oral dose of enalapril (5 mg). Exhaled air was collected at baseline and at 2 and 4 hours after administration of the drug. In study 1, enalapril significantly increased the NO release rate from the lung in normotensive subjects (36.9+/-5.1 pmol/s at baseline versus 58.3+/-7.3 pmol/s at 4 hours, P<0.01). Nitrendipine did not change the NO release rate. In study 2, enalapril significantly increased the release of NO from the lung in normotensive subjects (40.4+/-6.0 pmol/s at baseline versus 70. 3+/-11.4 pmol/s at 4 hours, P<0.01) but not in hypertensive subjects. ACE inhibition increased NO production from the lung in normotensive subjects but not in hypertensive patients. The reduction of angiotensin II production and/or the accumulation of bradykinin in the pulmonary tissue may be responsible for increased NO production in components of the lung, such as the pulmonary vascular endothelium, bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, nasopharyngeal cells, and neurons. However, the effects of ACE inhibition on NO production from the lung differ between hypertensive subjects and normotensive subjects.", 
    "492": "Endothelium-derived NO is considered to be primarily an important determinant of vascular tone and platelet activity; however, the modulation of myocardial metabolism by NO may be one of its most important roles. This modulation may be critical for the regulation of tissue metabolism. Several physiological processes act in concert to make endothelial NO synthase-derived NO potentially important in the regulation of mitochondrial respiration in cardiac tissue, including (1) the nature of the capillary network in the myocardium, (2) the diffusion distance for NO, (3) the low toxicity of NO at physiological (nanomolar) concentrations, (4) the fact that low PO(2) in tissue facilitates the action of NO on cytochrome oxidase, and (5) the formation of oxygen free radicals. A decrease in NO production is involved in the pathophysiological modifications that occur in heart failure and diabetes, disease states associated with altered cardiac metabolism that contributes to the evolution of the disease process. In contrast, several drugs (eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, amlodipine, and statins) can restore or maintain endogenous production of NO by endothelial cells, and this mechanism may explain part of their therapeutic efficiency. Thus, the purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the role of NO in the control of mitochondrial respiration, with special emphasis on its effect on cardiac metabolism.",

However, the effect of homocysteine on cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which has been reported to be nitric oxide related in experimental and animal studies, remains unclear in humans. Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme may improve nitric oxide-mediated cerebral as well as peripheral endothelial function.

Twenty were prescribed medications inappropriate to their renal function. Of patients with ischaemic heart disease and serum cholesterol > 5.5 mmol/l, 82% were untreated; 82% of patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism were also untreated. At initial referral, many patients' care was sub-optimal. Referral was too late for adequate preparation for renal replacement therapy in 33%.

In patients treated with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), an impaired kinin degradation can magnify the phenomenon. We have previously demonstrated that the electronegative charge of the dialysis membrane (e.g. AN69) and other cofactors including diluted blood buffer power promote BK generation, and that kallikrein synthesis on diluted plasma may be inhibited by keeping the pH value above 7.4. Our in vitro and ex vivo studies have demonstrated that the use of an alkaline solution to rinse both filter fluid compartments before their clinical use can inhibit the activation of mediators that are likely to be involved in HSRs.",

Two thirds of the nephrologists did not change their dialysis prescription but tried to modify the acidic environment of the patient's diluted blood at the first contact with the dialysis device using an alkaline rinsing procedure (BioPrime with alkaline solution). In other cases ACE-I withdrawal or a change of dialysis membrane was adopted. Thirty-six patients who received alkaline rinsing of the filters were monitored for a total of 686 months (median 17.6 months/patient) to control HSR recurrences.

PA, one of the mechanisms involved in repair of blood vessel injury, is related to diseases such as thrombosis. Developing a compound capable of inhibiting PA may thus provide a therapeutic tool. From the results of study, particularly in the case of 4-0-[N-(carbobenzyloxy) aminoacyl] ferulic acid (amino acid components: isoleucine, proline), inhibition of collagen-induced aggregation was maintained of the same level as with ferulic acid, but stronger dissociation of ADP-induced aggregation was detected. In other words, these compounds may not only prevent thrombosis but also dissolve thrombi. Further, the compounds with stronger tyrosinase-inhibitory activity were found to scavenge superoxide as effectively as ferulic acid. Since they are also more hydrophobic, they may be particularly efficacious as cosmetic ingredients.

The aim of our work was to assess the use of these drugs in Italy in comparison with beta-blockers and diuretics. We examined the consumption of the four main antihypertensive classes of drugs (beta-blockers, diuretics, calcium channel blockers and ACE- inhibitors). In-hospitalization data from the GIFA (Gruppo Italiano di Farmacoepidemiologia nell'Anziano) database were used. During the period from 1988 to 1995, the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs were calcium channel blockers (47%) followed by diuretics (37%), ACE-inhibitors (33%) and beta-blockers (5.5%). Changes over time in the use of these drugs were analysed: ACE-inhibitors had the greatest increase in use over time. Calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors and beta-blockers were usually prescribed to the youngest patients (aged <65 years), while diuretics to the oldest. Calcium channel blockers were prescribed to 60% of patients with myocardial infarction and to 55% of those with congestive heart failure. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the Italian physicians very often prescribe drugs like calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors. Among these pharmacological agents, enalapril (twice per day) and slow release calcium channel blockers are the most frequently prescribed drugs.", 
    "510": "Solid-phase synthesis was used to prepare a series of modifications to the selective and potent inhibitor of endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.15 (EP24.15), N-[1(R, S)-carboxy-3-phenylpropyl]-Ala-Ala-Tyr-p-aminobenzoate (cFP), which is degraded at the Ala-Tyr bond, thus severely limiting its utility in vivo. Reducing the amide bond between the Ala and Tyr decreased the potency of the inhibitor to 1/1000. However, the replacement of the second alanine residue immediately adjacent to the tyrosine with alpha-aminoisobutyric acid gave a compound (JA-2) that was equipotent with cFP, with a K(i) of 23 nM. Like cFP, JA-2 inhibited the closely related endopeptidase EC 3.4.24.16 1/20 to 1/30 as potently as it did EP24.15, and did not inhibit the other thermolysin-like endopeptidases angiotensin-converting enzyme, endothelin-converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase. The biological stability of JA-2 was investigated by incubation with a number of membrane and soluble sheep tissue extracts. In contrast with cFP, JA-2 remained intact after 48 h of incubation with all tissues examined. Further modifications to the JA-2 compound failed to improve the potency of this inhibitor. Hence JA-2 is a potent, EP24.15-preferential and biologically stable inhibitor, therefore providing a valuable tool for further assessing the biological functions of EP24.15.",

PS was done in prospective multicentric study between November 1, 1996 and December 31, 1996. 23 hospitals from various parts of Slovakia participated in this study.

TLT was performed in a statistically significantly smaller proportion of patients older than 65 years compared to patients 65 years of age and younger (20.9% vs 41.2%, p < or = 0.01). Females were treated with TLT statistically significantly less frequently than males (24.5% vs 35.1%, p < or = 0.05). The major cause for not performing the TLT was late arrival to hospital (in 32.1% patients). Betablockers were administered to a total of 42.9% of patients during EHP. Betablockers received only 3.6% of patients intravenously (!) and only 39.3% of patients orally. Treatment with oral betablockers was performed in a statistically significantly smaller proportion of patients older than 65 years compared to patients 65 years of age and younger (27.4% vs 49.7%, p < or = 0.01). Up to 49.1% of patients in EHP were treated with ACE inhibitors, however, left ventricular ejection fraction < 40% warranting feasibility of this treatment was achieved only in 26.7% of patients.

On the other hand, the use of TLT and betablockers is dissatisfactory. Requirement to increase the proportion of thrombolysed patients with AMI and the necessity for substantially more frequent use of betablockers, especially intravenous, in EHP in these patients result from these findings. In Slovakia, inadequately large proportion of patients with AMI is treated with ACE inhibitors, heparin, and partially also nitrates administered per os during EHP. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)", 
    "529": "ACE inhibitors are a widely prescribed class of drug for the management of hypertension. Their therapeutic role in the treatment of heart failure, diabetic nephropathy and post myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction is steadily increasing. Although ACE inhibitors have a similar mechanism of action--namely, inhibition of circulatory ACE, thereby decreasing the formation of angiotensin II--individual members differ in their physicochemical properties, enzyme-binding kinetics, pharmacokinetic profile, organ-specific affinity and selectivity, as well as in their bradykinin potentiating effect. These factors play an important part in influencing the pharmacological profile of an agent and its clinical efficacy, especially in the treatment of hypertension. It is therefore prudent to take into account the existing pharmacological and clinically relevant differences between the individual members of this drug class before making the decision to select a particular ACE inhibitor for the long-term management of arterial hypertension.", 
    "530": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) plays a central role in blood pressure regulation and fluid and electrolyte homoeostasis. Blockade of this system with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has been shown to benefit several groups of patients, including those with essential hypertension, congestive heart failure, and post myocardial infarction. Inhibition of ACE also slows the progression of diabetic renal disease and diabetic retinopathy. The recent development of agents that are specific antagonists of angiotensin II (AII) has allowed us to block the RAS at receptor level. Inhibition of angiotensin II receptors has been shown to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients, without the side-effect profile of ACE inhibitors. It has yet to be shown whether manipulating the RAS in this way will confer the same morbidity and mortality benefits as those seen with ACE inhibition. Ongoing research will reveal whether All antagonists are beneficial in congestive heart failure, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus. The development of this new class of agent provides an exciting opportunity for clinicians to increase their understanding of the role of the RAS in health and disease.",

Data documenting the course of the disease and its associated costs over a period of one year were collected retrospectively. A total of 400 CHF patients, 200 in each treatment group, were included in the analysis. Concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy was received by 46% of patients in both groups. More torasemide-treated patients (38.0%) than furosemide-treated patients (24.5%) achieved an improvement in NYHA class in the one-year period. The main difference between the two groups was the number of CHF-related hospitalisations: 62 vs 324 hospital days due to CHF were necessary among torasemide- and furosemide-treated patients, respectively. Thus torasemide treatment was associated with an 80% reduction in hospital days compared with furosemide. Furthermore, about 30% fewer working days were lost in the torasemide group than in the furosemide group (441 days vs 617 days, respectively). Direct and indirect costs were evaluated, resulting in overall annual costs of DEM 1502 per torasemide-treated patient and DEM 1863 per furosemide-treated patient. A cost-effectiveness analysis showed a difference between the therapies of DEM 3651 in favour of torasemide. In conclusion, treatment with torasemide improved clinical outcome and was more cost-effective than with furosemide.",

These drugs have not gained wide acceptance in the treatment of hypertension in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) because of a potential for decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate associated with a single kidney and concomitant cyclosporine use. Experimental animal models suggest that ACEi may be of benefit in slowing the progression of chronic renal allograft rejection. We undertook a retrospective chart analysis of all RTRs in our institution who had been treated with an ACEi or an angiotensin II (AT II) antagonist, with the objectives of determining the safety, efficacy, and side effect profile of these medications. The minimum follow-up period was 6 months. One hundred seventy-seven of 642 RTRs were prescribed an ACEi or AT II antagonist. Forty-seven patients discontinued therapy, with the most common causes of discontinuation being cough (8 patients) and hyperkalemia (6 patients). The mean arterial blood pressure at each follow-up period was lower than that at the time of initiation of ACEi or AT II antagonist therapy, with a decrease from 92 +/- 12 mm Hg to 86 +/- 9 mm Hg (P < 0.05) after 3 years of treatment. The serum creatinine concentrations did not change throughout the follow-up period. There was a nonsustained increase from the baseline serum potassium of 4.4 +/- 0.5 to 4.6 +/- 0.6 mEq/L at 3 months (P < 0.05), but no further increases in potassium beyond this time. The mean hemoglobin concentration for the cohort did not change, but 13 RTRs given an ACEi for posttransplantation erythrocytosis (PTE) had a decrease in hemoglobin from 17.1 +/- 1.0 g/dL at the start of ACEi therapy to 14.8 +/- 2.2 g/dL at 3 years (P < 0.05).

Following administration to pregnant rats, DDE was shown to cause feminization in the male offspring at the neonatal stages but did not affect the pubertal growth of accessory sex organs. In this study, we examined the potential of in utero exposure to antiandrogens to alter the responsiveness of the male rats to subsequent DDE challenge. Pregnant Long-Evans rats were dosed by gavage from Gestation Day 14 to 18 at 0, 10 (low dose), or 100 (high dose) mg DDE, or 40 mg flutamide/kg body wt (bw)/day (in utero treatment). At approximately 80 days of age, the male offspring from each of the four in utero treatment groups were divided into two groups. One group received the adult treatment of four daily gavage administrations of DDE at 70 mg/kg bw (adult treatment), while the second group served as the adult treatment control (adult control). The in utero treatment resulted in 18, 31, and 53% reductions of ventral prostate weights at approximately 85 days of age compared to the control for the low- and high-dose DDE and flutamide groups, respectively. These results suggest that the in utero antiandrogen treatments produced a latent effect on prostate growth that became pronounced only in the postpubertal stage. The in utero treatment also altered the responsiveness of the prostate to the adult treatment, indicated by a significant reduction in ventral prostate weight that was seen only in the control group of the in utero treatment but not in the other groups. The in utero treatment was also associated with expression of testosterone-repressed prostatic message-2 in the adult ventral prostate. In addition, a few prostates in the high-dose DDE- and flutamide-treated groups of the in utero treatment were found to have chronic suppurative prostatitis. While other types of hormonal manipulations have been shown to incite similar responses in rat prostate, the possible linkage between in utero antiandrogen treatment and prostatic inflammation needs to be further evaluated.",

This was a substudy of the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) study. HOT study patients who had a body mass index > or =27 kg/m2 were randomized to receive either the weight loss intervention, which included dietary counseling and group support, or to serve as the control group. Patients' weights and number of medication steps (per HOT protocol) required to achieve target diastolic blood pressure were measured at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months.

Patients (n = 28) received 5 mg ramipril daily or placebo for 6 weeks in a double-blind crossover design, followed by 6 months of open ramipril treatment. Mental stress (a 20-min Stroop's color word conflict test) and a cold pressor test were performed at the end of each of the three study periods. Noninvasive blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. Ramipril reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels at rest (from 146+/-3/99+/-3 with placebo to 135+/-4/94+/-3 at 6 weeks, and 136+/-4/91+/-3 mm Hg at 6 months, in the laboratory) and during mental stress. Resting heart rates were unchanged by ramipril. Ramipril reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate responses during mental stress; diastolic blood pressure responses were unchanged. Ramipril reduced cardiac workload (systolic blood pressure x heart rate) levels and responses. Treatment effects at 6 months were generally greater than at 6 weeks. During the cold pressor test systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels were lowered by ramipril, but responses were unchanged. Heart rate responses, however, were reduced. Thus, ramipril reduced cardiac workload levels and responses also during the cold pressor test. These findings show that ACE inhibitors can reduce cardiac workload during stressful situations. If confirmed, this would seem to offer an advantage in the treatment of hypertension.", 
    "544": "Pharmacologic effects of specific drugs are frequently attributed to their therapeutic class because all agents within a particular class have the same mechanism of action. Because \"head-to-head\" comparisons in trials are rare, any differentiation between drugs of the same class is usually limited to comparisons of their pharmacokinetic profiles, and it is usually assumed that most of the drugs in a therapeutic class have similar efficacies. Two recent randomized clinical trials demonstrated that the antihypertensive agents irbesartan and losartan, both angiotensin receptor blockers, are not equally effective in reducing blood pressure among patients with hypertension. In both a fixed-dose trial and a titration-protocol trial, patients treated with irbesartan achieved a greater reduction in blood pressure than did those treated with losartan. The response rate was also higher among patients treated with irbesartan. Therefore, irbesartan, used either alone or as a component of response-based combination therapy with a diuretic, is a more potent antihypertensive agent than losartan. These results and the previously published pharmacologic profiles of these drugs demonstrate that angiotensin receptor blockers are, like many other classes of antihypertensive agents, more different than alike.", 
    "545": "Angiotensin II plays a central role in the regulation of systemic arterial pressure through its systemic synthesis via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cascade. It acts directly on vascular smooth muscle as a potent vasoconstrictor. In addition, it affects cardiac contractility and heart rate through its action on the sympathetic nervous system. Angiotensin II also alters renal sodium and water absorption through its ability to stimulate the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete aldosterone. Furthermore, it enhances thirst and stimulates the secretion of the antidiuretic hormone. Consequently, angiotensin II plays a critical role in both the acute and chronic regulation of blood pressure through its systemic endocrine regulation. A potent neurohormone that regulates systemic arterial pressure, angiotensin II also affects vascular structure and function via paracrine and autocrine effects of local tissue-based synthesis. This alternate pathway of angiotensin II production is catalyzed in tissues via enzymes such as cathepsin G, chymostatin-sensitive angiotensin II-generating enzyme, and chymase. Intratissue formation of angiotensin II plays a critical role in cardiovascular remodeling. Upregulation of these alternate pathways may occur through stretch, stress, and turbulence within the blood vessel. Similar processes within the myocardium and glomeruli of the kidney may also lead to restructuring in these target organs, with consequent organ dysfunction. Additionally, angiotensin II may increase receptor density and sensitivity for other factors that modulate growth of vascular smooth muscle, such as fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor beta-1, platelet-derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factors. Atherosclerosis may also be related, in part, to excessive angiotensin II effect on the vessel wall, which causes smooth muscle cell growth and migration. It also activates macrophages and increases platelet aggregation. Angiotensin II stimulates plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and directly causes endothelial dysfunction. Other postulated effects of angiotensin II on vascular structure that could promote atherogenesis include inhibition of apoptosis, increase in oxidative stress, promotion of leukocyte adhesion and migration, and stimulation of thrombosis. Inhibition of angiotensin II synthesis with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor has been demonstrated to be beneficial in modifying human disease progression. This is clearly apparent in clinical trials involving patients with diabetic nephropathy, postmyocardial infarction, or advanced degrees of systolic heart failure. Thus, angiotensin II is an excellent target for pharmacologic blockade. Not only does it play a pivotal role in both the acute and chronic regulation of systemic arterial pressure, but it also is an important modulator of cardiovascular structure and function and may be specifically involved in disease progression. Modification of angiotensin II effect may therefore serve a dual purpose. Not only will blood pressure reduction occur with less stretch, stress, and turbulence of the vascular wall, but there will also be less stimulation, either directly or indirectly, for restructuring and remodeling of the cardiovascular tree.", 
    "546": "Extensive clinical experience with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with renal disease has demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure, proteinuria, and the rate of progression of renal disease. This is evident in both diabetic and nondiabetic nephropathy, particularly that associated with proteinuria. The ability of ACE inhibitors to stabilize renal function is not attenuated by more severe renal insufficiency, but greater caution with these drugs is necessary, as there may be drug accumulation and a greater propensity for an increase in serum potassium and creatinine levels. Both of these effects are self-limited and rarely require discontinuation of the drug. Increases in creatinine up to 20% are expected; greater increases are indicative of volume depletion or anatomic renal artery disease. Angiotensin II receptor blockers reduce blood pressure to a degree comparable to that achieved with ACE inhibitors, and like ACE inhibitors, they reduce proteinuria to an extent greater than what would be expected by blood pressure reduction alone. Angiotensin II receptor blockers are currently being evaluated in comparison with other therapies in two large clinical trials of non-insulin-dependent diabetic nephropathy with proteinuria to assess impact on the rate of progression of renal disease. Because of their antihypertensive/ antiproteinuric properties, it is likely they will provide some advantages over conventional drugs in protecting renal function. Early clinical experience with these drugs in patients with renal disease suggests that there might be a lesser incidence of functional renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia compared with ACE inhibitors.", 
    "547": "The renin-angiotensin system has two roles in clinical hypertension: its vasoconstrictor properties directly govern blood pressure, and its actions on arterial smooth muscle, connective tissue, and endothelial integrity affect cardiovascular prognosis. Additionally, the direct actions of angiotensin II on the function and structure of the heart and renal vasculature influence clinical events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have produced functional and clinical outcome benefits in clinical trials of patients with congestive heart failure, systolic dysfunction after myocardial infarction, and diabetic nephropathy. Similar favorable trends have been noted in observational studies in hypertension. Because such enzymes as chymase can substitute for ACE, the ACE inhibitors may not completely block angiotensin II formation, although they enhance bradykinin accumulation and secondarily stimulate nitric oxide and vasodilatory prostaglandins. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) selectively block the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor that not only mediates the known effects of angiotensin II but, according to recent reports, might be responsible for sequestering angiotensin II molecules in renal and cardiac cells. Moreover, by increasing plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, the ARB stimulate the unblocked angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptors, which-if they exist in meaningful numbers in human hypertension-mediate additional vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects. The contrasting actions of these two classes of drugs might be clinically relevant. For example, they may have additive antihypertensive efficacy; they have differing effects on renal plasma flow; and in a small pilot study of patients with congestive heart failure, the ARB demonstrated an apparent advantage in survival. Ongoing clinical trials will try to determine whether the effects of ARB can equal or even exceed the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors on cardiovascular prognosis.", 
    "548": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been identified as one of the strongest blood pressure-independent risk factors for sudden death, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and other cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Hypertensive patients with LVH have a significantly greater prevalence of premature ventricular contractions and complex ventricular arrhythmias than do patients without LVH or normotensive patients. Antihypertensive therapy reduces LVH, although not all antihypertensive drugs are equipotent in this regard. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are probably the most effective in reducing LVH, followed by calcium antagonists, diuretics, and beta-blockers. The effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on left ventricular mass is unclear at the present, some studies showing a reduction, some studies showing no effect. A reduction in LVH has been shown to diminish LVH-associated arrhythmias. However, it remains to be shown that patients with LVH and ventricular ectopy are at a higher risk for sudden death than those without ventricular ectopy and that the reduction of LVH-associated ventricular ectopy indeed confers a clinical benefit that exceeds the one from the reduction of arterial pressure alone.", 
    "549": "The activity of the cardiac renin-angiotensin system is altered in human heart failure, but the regulatory mechanisms are unknown. We analyzed whether angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) mRNA expression in heart failure is altered in the atrial myocardium, and whether a correlation exists between atrial ACE mRNA expression and the parameters of left ventricular function. We also investigated whether the use of ACE inhibitors or the ACE I/D genotype modulates the atrial ACE mRNA content. For this purpose patients who were to undergo routine cardiac surgery were selected in a prospective manner according to left ventricular function and ACE inhibitor therapy. Samples of atrial myocardium were taken, and ACE mRNA expression was determined by internally standardized reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Atrial ACE mRNA expression did not differ in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction higher than 55% (2423+/-199 copies/ng RNA) and those with a value less than 45% (2661+/-143 copies/ng RNA, n.s.). ACE mRNA expression also did not differ in patients using ACE inhibitors (2585+/-175 copies/ng RNA) and those not using ACE inhibitors (2476+/-185 copies/ng RNA). Furthermore, atrial ACE mRNA expression was not affected by the ACE genotype (DD 2573+/-203, ID 2472+/-215, II 2563+/-249 copies/ng RNA). We conclude that the regulation of atrial ACE mRNA expression occurs predominantly by local mechanical or para- or autocrine factors.", 
    "550": "Treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI) has been advanced considerably in the past 20 years with the advent of acute reperfusion strategies such as thrombolytic therapy or primary angioplasty and the use of adjunctive medical therapies such as aspirin, beta-blockers, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins); each has been proven to reduce morbidity and mortality rates after MI. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have earned an important place in this list of winners, particularly in patients clinically assessed as being at higher risk for cardiovascular death. The benefits of treating such patients with an ACE inhibitor have clearly shown significant improvements in survival that are both complementary and additive to the other proven therapies. However, a significant subset of patients treated with ACE inhibitors will die or have worsening congestive heart failure despite adequate therapy. Appropriate risk stratification can help guide the clinician in identifying patients at greatest risk for cardiovascular events after MI. Fortunately, investigators are currently exploring the potential benefits of more specific and selective blockade of the renin-angiotensin system with AT(1) receptor blockers (ARBs) in the hope of enhancing survival beyond that evidenced with ACE inhibition alone. These agents pharmacologically inhibit the renin-angiotensin system at the angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor level. Although there are theories postulating why blocking the harmful effects of Ang II at this receptor would be more effective than inhibiting ACE-mediated conversion from inactive Ang I to Ang II, extrapolation to the clinical setting remains highly speculative. These hypotheses can only be tested by direct comparisons of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the appropriate patient populations. The VALIANT (Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial is testing the hypothesis that interruption of the renin-angiotensin pathway by using the ARB valsartan alone or in combination with an ACE inhibitor will be more effective in saving lives than an ACE inhibitor alone in treating patients at high risk. This trial will enroll patients with symptoms of congestive heart failure or depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and randomly assign them to either captopril, valsartan, or the combination. Other proven conventional post-MI therapies are encouraged. This study will definitively determine whether the use of valsartan offers additional benefits over those achieved with ACE inhibitor monotherapy in patients at high risk after MI.", 
    "551": "Congestive heart failure (HF) is a common and serious public health problem affecting approximately 5 million Americans. Recent treatment strategies have focused on attenuating the effects of angiotensin (Ang) II, which include vasoconstriction, sodium retention, sympathetic activation, and cell growth. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which primarily block the systemic formation of Ang II, reduce HF-related morbidity and mortality rates. However, ACE inhibitors may not suppress Ang II activity over their entire dosing interval and, with long-term therapy, Ang II levels tend to return to normal. It is now known that Ang II can be formed independent of ACE by the action of enzymes such as chymase in local tissues, including the heart. Despite the established benefits of ACE inhibitor treatment, HF-related morbidity and mortality rates continue to increase because the aging of the population is placing more patients at risk of HF. By acting at the receptor level, Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) should, at least theoretically, provide more \"complete\" Ang II blockade. Early evidence suggests that ARBs induce hemodynamic improvement in patients with HF and may reduce mortality rates. Because ACE inhibitors and ARBs block Ang II through fundamentally different mechanisms, the combination may provide additive therapeutic effects in patients with HF. Results from a pilot study suggest that the combination of an ACE inhibitor and valsartan results in a more thorough inhibition of Ang II and an additive improvement in cardiac hemodynamics. Clinical trials now in progress will elucidate the effects of combined ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy on HF-related morbidity and mortality rates.", 
    "552": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), a target-organ response to chronic pressure or volume overload, is associated with its own independent risks of death in patients with hypertension. Numerous studies have shown that LVH increases the risk of coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attack, all-cause deaths, and sudden death. Although the mechanisms by which LVH develops are incompletely understood, the renin-angiotensin system may play an important role. All major classes of antihypertensive agents (calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) can cause LVH regression but not all to the same degree. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may provide the most pronounced reduction in left ventricular mass per millimeter of mercury of blood pressure reduction. In addition, animal studies and human trials show promise for the regression of LVH with the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Because ARBs act specifically on the AT(1) receptor, angiotensin II can exert its favorable effects on cell growth inhibition through the AT(2) receptor. One small study that compared the ARB valsartan with atenolol found significant regression of LVH with the ARB by 8 months of treatment.", 
    "553": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is one of the oldest known hormone systems. Its effector hormone, angiotensin (Ang) II, acts through 2 receptor subtypes, AT(1) and AT(2). Most physiologic effects of Ang II, including vasoconstriction, renal salt and water retention, aldosterone and vasopressin release, and sympathetic facilitation, are mediated by AT(1). Recent data, however, suggest that Ang II also contributes to cell proliferation, left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular media hypertrophy, neointima formation in atherosclerosis, and nephrosclerosis by stimulation of AT(1) receptors. AT(2) receptors are associated with antiproliferation, cell differentiation and development, tissue regeneration, and apoptosis. They also antagonize AT(1) receptor-mediated effects, which suggests that the ratio of angiotensin receptors expressed on a particular cell can determine the net effect of Ang II. Selective AT(1) receptor antagonists (\"sartans\") have been used to treat several million hypertensive patients worldwide. These agents offer a powerful therapeutic alternative to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which reduce the generation of Ang II. Conversely, AT(1) receptor antagonists block the RAS by acting on cellular angiotensin receptors and do not interfere with the breakdown of kinins. These medications inhibit the RAS more completely than do the ACE inhibitors because their action is independent of Ang II-generating pathways. At the same time, early, preliminary data suggest that AT(1) receptor antagonists offer target-organ protection similar to that provided by the ACE inhibitors. Because AT(2) receptors are left unopposed and Ang II levels are increased with AT(1) receptor antagonist treatment, it is important to understand the function of AT(2) to fully appreciate the mechanisms of action of AT(1) receptor antagonists, especially their potential for target-organ protection.", 
    "554": "Increasing prevalence, use of health services, and number of deaths have made congestive heart failure (CHF) a new epidemic in the United States. Yet there are no adequate data to guide treatment of the more typical and complex cases of patients who are very old and frail.", 
    "555": "Using the SAGE database, we studied the cases of 86,094 patients with CHF admitted to any of the 1492 long-term care facilities of 5 states from 1992 through 1996. We described their clinical and functional characteristics and their pharmacologic treatment to verify agreement with widely approved guidelines. We evaluated age- and sex-related differences, and we determined predictors of receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor by developing a multiple logistic regression model.", 
    "556": "The mean age of the population was 84.9 +/- 8 years. Eighty percent of the patients 85 years of age or older were women. More than two thirds of patients underwent frequent hospitalizations related to CHF in the year preceding admission to a long-term care facility. Coronary heart disease and hypertension were the most common causes. Half of the patients received digoxin and 45% a diuretic, regardless of background cardiovascular comorbidities. Only 25% of patients had a prescription for ACE inhibitors. The presence of cardiovascular comorbidity, already being a recipient of a large number of medications, a previous hospitalization for CHF, and admission to the facility in recent years were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving an ACE inhibitor. The presence of severe physical limitation was inversely related to use of ACE inhibitors, as were a series of organizational factors related to the facilities.", 
    "557": "Patients in long-term care who have CHF little resemble to those enrolled in randomized trials. This circumstance may explain, at least in part, the divergence from pharmacologic management consensus guidelines. Yet the prescription of ACE inhibitors varies significantly across facilities and depends on organizational characteristics.", 
    "558": "In the Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy study, ramipril decreased the rate of GFR decline (deltaGFR) and progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 352 patients with proteinuric chronic nephropathies. This study investigated whether in these patients disease outcome and response to treatment were affected by gender or insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene. deltaGFR (0.43 +/- 0.05 versus 0.48 +/- 0.08 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and incidence of ESRD (23 and 22%, respectively) were comparable in male and female patients. However, compared to conventional treatment, ramipril decreased deltaGFR (-52% versus -19%) and progression to ESRD (-74% versus -40%) more effectively in women than in men. Thus, the relative risk (95% confidence interval [CI]) of events (ESRD) between conventional and ramipril treatment was 5.52 (1.59 to 19.17, P = 0.003) in women, but only 1.80 (1.08 to 2.97, P = 0.02) in men. This gender-related effect of ramipril was associated with more reduction in proteinuria (-7.8 +/- 4.2% versus -21.9 +/- 5.7%, P = 0.05) and was still evident even after correction for potentially confounding factors such as baseline GFR, daily sodium intake, ramipril dose, BP control, and concomitant treatment with diuretics or dihydropyridinic calcium channel blockers (adjusted RR [95% CI]: women, 5.07 [1.26 to 20.38], P = 0.02; men, 1.44 [0.85 to 2.44], P = 0.17). Ramipril uniformly decreased deltaGFR and incidence of ESRD in women with either DD (-39% and - 100%) or II + ID (-71% and -82%) genotype, and in men (-25% and -50%) with the DD genotype, but had no beneficial effect in men with the II + ID genotype (+18% and +34%). Thus, the relative risk of events (ESRD) between conventional and ramipril-treated men was higher in subjects with the DD genotype (1.85; 0.69 to 4.94) and lower in those with the II +/- ID genotype (0.71; 0.28 to 1.80). Again, in parallel with deltaGFR and events, proteinuria decreased in women with DD (-23.3 +/-8.0%) or II + ID (-16.0 +/- 9.5%) genotype and in men with the DD genotype (-14.8 +/- 7.0%), but did not change in men with II + ID genotype (+ 1.0 +/- 7.8%). Of note, the ACE genotype-related effect of ramipril was still evident even after correction for the above potentially confounding factors (adjusted RR [95% CI]: DD, 2.52 [0.83 to 7.63], P = 0.10; II + ID, 0.35 [0.12 to 1.01], P = 0.05). Thus, among patients with chronic proteinuric nephropathies, men are at increased risk of progression due to their lower response to ACE inhibitor treatment. ACE inhibition is uniformly renoprotective in women regardless of the ACE polymorphism, and in men with the DD genotype, but is virtually devoid of beneficial effects in men with the II or ID genotype. This information may help to guide therapeutic interventions in clinical practice and to interpret the results of prospective trials in chronic renal disease.", 
    "559": "Renovascular hypertension represents a form of correctable hypertension and preventable renal failure. Such patients need to be identified early so that specific therapy can be instigated. Patient identification requires a high index of suspicion in patients with certain clinical features. Subsequent non-invasive imaging may result in angiography which is required for diagnostic purposes and for planning intervention. Correctable therapy takes one of two forms, namely percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty, with or without stenting, or surgical revascularisation, together with modification of underlying risk factors.", 
    "560": "Quantitative structure-activity relationships of various classes of antihypertensive agents, e.g., sympatholytic agents, diuretics, direct or peripheral vasodilators, potassium channel activators, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, renin inhibitors and miscellaneous agents (platelet aggregation inhibitors) are reviewed. This review gives an overall picture of the mode of action of each class of drugs and points out their specific physicochemical and structural properties governing their action. For example, in the case of centrally acting drugs (sympatholytic agents) it has surfaced that the prime factors governing their activity are lipophilic and steric properties of the molecules, and at the receptor level a charge-transfer complex is formed between the molecule and the receptor. It is, however, observed that for peripherally acting sympatholytic agents the prime role is played by only lipophilicity. In the case of diuretics, the electronic characters of molecules are found to be more dominant than their lipophilic property, but for direct vasodilators and ACE inhibitors both electronic and lipophilic properties seem to be equally important. In renin or platelet aggregation inhibitors, the structural properties appear to be more important. However, the fundamental property that is overwhelmingly involved in the majority of antihypertensive agents appears to be the lipophilicity, suggesting that in most of the cases the hydrophobic interaction would play the major role in drug action.", 
    "561": "Heart failure is a major cause of death, hospital admissions and poor quality of life. It affects some 1-2% of the general population, increasing to up to 8% in people over 75 years of age. Although treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduces symptoms and mortality, 50-70% of patients with heart failure still die within 5 years of diagnosis. There is thus clear scope for improving the treatment of patients with this condition. The CHARM programme is designed to define the clinical benefits of the long-acting angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, in a wide variety of patients with symptomatic heart failure. Candesartan cilexetil will be evaluated in three double-blind, randomized studies involving patients grouped according to left ventricular function and ACE inhibitor tolerance/intolerance.", 
    "562": "Heart failure remains a major and increasing cause of mortality and morbidity, even when the best available treatments are used. One of its key causes is neuroendocrine activation via the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Neuroendocrine blockers of the sympathetic nervous system (beta-blockers) and of the RAS (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and angiotensin II type 1 [AT 1 ] receptor blockers) therefore have an important potential therapeutic role in heart failure. The promising results from clinical trials with beta-blockers suggest that these drugs will become an established part of the future management of patients with mild to moderate symptomatic heart failure. Blockade of the RAS with ACE inhibitors has also been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure. Blockade of the AT1-receptor, with agents such as candesartan, produces more specific and, theoretically, more complete blockade of the major negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II than is possible using ACE inhibitors, whilst maintaining placebo-like tolerability. Furthermore, AT 1 -receptor blockade leads to increased stimulation of the angiotensin II type 2 (AT 2 ) receptor, which, according to experimental data, may have favourable cardiovascular effects. Following encouraging results from two pilot studies, a major new international study programme - CHARM (Candesartan in Heart failure - Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and morbidity) - has been initiated to define the clinical benefits of candesartan cilexetil in a wide variety of patients with symptomatic heart failure. CHARM is the first study to accept all relevant heart failure patients who may benefit from RAS blockade, irrespective of their left ventricular function or tolerance of ACE inhibitors. The 6500 patients to be recruited will be divided among three integrated outcome studies. Two of these studies will examine the effect of candesartan cilexetil versus placebo in patients with an ejection fraction of 40% or less who are tolerant or intolerant of ACE inhibitors. The third study arm will examine the benefits of candesartan cilexetil in a previously seldom studied group: those with symptomatic heart failure, but with preserved left-ventricular systolic function. Recruitment of patients into the study has started.", 
    "563": "Suppression of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is an established method for controlling blood pressure and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition to reducing blood pressure, suppression of the RAS is able to protect against the target-organ damage that results from hypertension. Unfortunately, despite the use of ACE inhibitors and agents from the other classes of conventional antihypertensives, effective control of blood pressure remains poor. A major contribution to this failure to control blood pressure appears to be lack of compliance with the prescribed medication, arising from the presence of unacceptable side effects. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor blockers, such as candesartan, are the latest class of antihypertensive agent to be developed. They target the AT 1 -receptor - the final common pathway for all the known negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II - and provide pronounced antihypertensive efficacy without the side effects of cough and angioneurotic oedema that are associated with the use of ACE inhibitors.", 
    "564": "Prognosis can be improved in hypertensive patients not only by reducing blood pressure, but probably also by effective suppression of adverse neurohormonal influences. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors effectively reduces left ventricular hypertrophy and decreases morbidity and mortality due to heart failure, as well as slowing the progression of renal disease. Initial data from studies of angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor blockers indicate that these agents should also be effective in reducing cardiac and renal damage. In this class, candesartan, by virtue of its tight and long-lasting binding to the AT 1 -receptor, provides pronounced 24-h blood pressure control with effective blockade of all the major negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II. Candesartan cilexetil has also been shown to be effective and well tolerated in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in those hypertensive patients who require more than one agent to reach their target blood pressure.", 
    "565": "Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is frequently associated with persistent dry cough. This side effect is thought to be due to the non-specific action of ACE inhibitors, which, in addition to suppressing the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), leads to the accumulation of kinins, encephalins and other biologically active peptides. Candesartan cilexetil is a new, long-acting angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor blocker, which offers a more specific means of suppressing the RAS than can be achieved with ACE inhibitors. In this study, we compared the incidence and severity of cough during treatment with candesartan cilexetil, enalapril and placebo in patients with hypertension and enalapril-induced cough. Men and women, aged 20-80 years, with a history of medically treated primary hypertension and ACE-inhibitor-related cough were enrolled. The presence of cough was confirmed during a 4-week challenge period with enalapril, 10 mg, which abated during a subsequent 4-week washout period with placebo. Patients with confirmed ACE-inhibitor-related cough were then randomized to double-blind treatment with candesartan cilexetil, 8 mg once daily ( n = 62), enalapril, 10 mg once daily ( n = 66), or placebo ( n = 26). Baseline blood pressure was similar in all groups. Although blood pressure was recorded during the study, this was for safety monitoring, and the measurements were not standardized in relation to study drug intake or time of day. The frequency of dry cough was recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS). For each assessment, patients marked a cross on a straight horizontal 100 mm line, rating cough frequency from 'none of the time( at one end of the line to 'all of the time( at the other end. The impact of treatment on quality of life was also studied, using the Symptom Assessment (SA) questionnaire and the Minor Symptom Evaluation (MSE) profile. The SA questionnaire assessed the severity of nine symptoms, including dry cough, by means of a five-graded Likert scale (not at all, a little, moderately, quite a bit, extremely). Changes in the three dimensions of the MSE profile - contentment, vitality and sleep - were recorded using a VAS. Candesartan cilexetil was superior to enalapril regarding the change in frequency ( p = 0.001) and severity ( p < 0.001) of dry cough. After 8 weeks of treatment, the proportions of patients with cough were 26.9% for placebo, 35.5% for candesartan cilexetil and 68.2% for enalapril ( p < 0.001, candesartan cilexetil versus enalapril; p > 0.20, candesartan cilexetil versus placebo). Treatment with candesartan cilexetil did not compromise patients' well-being. Compared with placebo, candesartan cilexetil was superior in terms of its effect on contentment; similar trends were noted for vitality and sleep, although the differences were not significant. When all adverse events were considered, candesartan cilexetil was very well tolerated. No serious adverse events occurred in the candesartan cilexetil or placebo groups, while three patients in the enalapril group reported serious adverse events (chest pain, agranulocytosis, accidental fracture). No treatment-related changes of clinical relevance could be found with regard to laboratory variables, ECG or vital signs/physical findings, except the anticipated blood pressure reduction in the active treatment groups. In conclusion, candesartan cilexetil is not associated with cough in hypertensive patients with previous ACE-inhibitor-induced cough. The incidence of dry cough in patients treated with candesartan cilexetil was similar to that of placebo and lower than that of enalapril.", 
    "566": "Angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1 ) receptor blockers, such as candesartan, are attractive alternatives to ACE inhibitors in the treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Although angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are able to suppress the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), their mechanism of action may limit their clinical utility in the treatment of hypertension. For example, they act as competitive inhibitors of ACE. This means that their effects can be overcome by high levels of angiotensin I, which occur after ACE inhibition due to removal of the negative feedback effect of angiotensin II on renal renin release. ACE inhibitors are also unable to block the production of angiotensin II by non-ACE-mediated pathways. Furthermore, ACE is not a specific enzyme. Its inhibition therefore has effects on other substances, such as bradykinin, leading to the class-specific side effects associated with ACE inhibitors. Candesartan, on the other hand, binds insurmountably to the AT 1 -receptor, thereby providing more complete blockade of the negative cardiovascular effects of angiotensin II than is possible with ACE inhibitors. The specificity of AT 1 -receptor blockade also ensures that efficacy is achieved without inducing the side effect of cough that results from the non-specific consequences of ACE inhibition. Preclinical and early clinical studies demonstrate that AT 1 -receptor blockers produce at least the same degree of target-organ protection as has been demonstrated for ACE inhibitors. Additional benefits of AT 1 -receptor blockers may arise from the fact that, unlike ACE inhibitors, they do not prevent the activity of angiotensin II on AT 2 -receptors in the heart, which is thought to reduce cardiac remodelling. From a mechanistic perspective, therefore, AT 1 -receptor blockers appear to have advantages over ACE inhibitors, in terms of a more complete blockade of angiotensin II effects, while also avoiding the specific side effects associated with ACE inhibition.", 
    "567": "The second Swedish Trial in Old patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension-2) was conducted to compare the effects of 'newer( antihypertensive therapies (angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors and calcium antagonists) and established therapies (beta-blockers and diuretics) on cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in elderly hypertensive patients. A total of 6614 patients were randomized to receive conventional treatment, ACE inhibitors or calcium antagonists, and followed for a mean of 5 years. The primary endpoint was a combination of fatal stroke, fatal myocardial infarction and other fatal cardiovascular disease; secondary endpoints were a combination of fatal or non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular mortality. The three treatments produced similar reductions in supine systolic blood pressure. There were no significant differences in the risk of cardiovascular events between patients receiving conventional therapy and those receiving newer therapies. All three treatments were well tolerated. The STOP-Hypertension-2 results thus add to the extensive literature showing the benefits of blood pressure reduction in elderly hypertensive patients. Moreover, they are consistent with current management guidelines which emphasise the importance of the achieved blood pressure reduction in the prevention of cardiovascular events.", 
    "568": "Since most developed countries have an ageing population, the prevalence of hypertension is increasing. This age-driven increase in cardiovascular risk is an important factor contributing to the increasing burden of mortality and morbidity associated with cardiovascular disease. Today, there is a strong rationale for an aggressive approach to hypertension since antihypertensive treatment has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the elderly. It is likely that increasing emphasis will be placed on control of isolated and borderline systolic hypertension, which are the predominant forms of hypertension in elderly patients. The recent second Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension-2) represents an important contribution to the literature since it shows that newer antihypertensive agents, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists, are as effective as older agents in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in elderly patients.", 
    "569": "The 1999 hypertension management guidelines issued by the World Health Organization and the International Society of Hypertension emphasize the importance of blood pressure reduction in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, they conclude that the benefits of treatment are due to blood pressure lowering per se, rather than to any specific antihypertensive therapy. The results of the second Swedish Trial in Old Patients with Hypertension (STOP-Hypertension-2) are consistent with these recommendations, since in this trial angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium antagonists reduced blood pressure to the same extent as conventional therapy with beta-blockers and diuretics in elderly hypertensive patients, and the three treatments produced similar reductions in the risk of cardiovascular events. Furthermore, a first subgroup analysis of cardiovascular mortality showed that the three treatments seemed equally effective in diabetic patients. The STOP-Hypertension-2 data, therefore, are fully consistent with the 1999 hypertension management guidelines, and underline the advantages offered by both older and newer antihypertensive therapies.", 
    "570": "This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows: Our objective is to appraise the effectiveness of beta blockers in patients with heart failure. Our protocol defined main outcome is all cause mortality. The specific a priori defined aims are to examine: the effectiveness of beta blockers in all trials of patients with heart failure, and examine the importance of the presence or absence of ischaemic cardiomyopathy in patients included in trials and vasodilator properties of beta blocking agents used. We will also examine the predictive value of left ventricular function, age, use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and New York Heart Association Class (NYHA), and the rate of discontinuation of therapy due to treatment. There are a number of important ongoing trials for which data will become available in the next few years. Thus a systematic review which may be updated regularly is required to provide an up to date synthesis of the available data in this increasingly important area.", 
    "571": "We used morphometric techniques and theoretical analysis to investigate structural and functional changes of the glomerular membrane that develop in passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), an experimental model of human membranous glomerulopathy The effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on the above parameters was also investigated to explore the mechanisms by which this treatment exerts functional and structural protection at the renal tissue level. Morphometric analysis of glomerular capillary by light and electron microscopy was performed in normal control rats and in rats injected with rabbit anti-Fx 1A antibody, 12 months after induction of PHN. A group of PHN rats treated with lisinopril during the observation period was also investigated. Glomerular capillary architecture was not significantly altered in PHN rats, thus glomerular volume and capillary lumen volume were comparable with normal controls; only mesangial volume was significantly elevated in PHN rats. Glomerular membrane structure was significantly affected by PHN: the thickness of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) increased, and the frequency of epithelial filtration slits decreased. Electron-dense deposits in the subepithelial space of the GBM were estimated to occupy more than 20% of the GBM area. Theoretical analysis of glomerular hydraulic permeability allowed us to predict that, after these structural changes, the permeability of the GBM and the epithelial layer significantly decreased, with an average reduction in the ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) of approximately 43%. ACE inhibition limited mesangial expansion and prevented changes of glomerular epithelial cells (filtration slit frequency) but not GBM thickening. Immune deposits within the GBM were only partially prevented by lisinopril. A selective effect on epithelial permeability was calculated in lisinopril-treated rats, and a partial preservation of Kf reduction was observed. These results suggest that structural changes of the GBM and epithelial cells that develop in PHN are responsible for the reduced filtration capacity observed in this model. ACE inhibition only partially prevented immune-deposits in the GBM and favorably affected epithelial cell structure. These selective effects on glomerular podocytes may contribute to preserve water and macromolecule permeability of the glomerular capillary wall in this immunologic model of kidney disease.", 
    "572": "This study examined whether the prevention of diabetes-related albuminuria by aminoguanidine (AG) or ramipril (RAM) may be mediated by a common post-glomerular basement membrane renal intracellular mechanism involving protein kinase C (PKC). The renal handling of albumin was examined over 24 weeks in control and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) that measures intact albumin, and intravenously injected tritium-labeled rat serum albumin, was used to assess the proportion of intact albumin and albumin fragments in urine. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by the intravenous administration of STZ at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Age-matched control rats received buffer alone. Diabetes was characterized by an increase in blood glucose (>15 mmol/l), an increase in GHb (means at 24 weeks 29.3+/-1.1%; control 6.1+/-0.1%, P<0.005), an increase in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (4.13+/-0.15 ml/min; control 3.54+/-0.19 ml/min, P<0.005), an increase in intact albumin excretion rate (expressed as geometric mean 11.64 times/divided by 2.11 mg/24 h; control 0.74 times/divided by 1.57 mg/24 h, P<0.005) as measured by RIA, and an increase in glomerular PKC activity (26.83+/-2.38 pmol x mg(-1) x min(-1); control 14.6+/-2.99 pmol x mg(-1) x min(-1), P<0.005). Treatment of diabetic rats with either AG or RAM prevented the rise in intact albuminuria and glomerular PKC activity. Renal lysosomal cathepsin activity decreased in diabetic rats and this was not prevented by AG or RAM. Neither drug affected glycemic control or GFR, but RAM reduced systolic blood pressure (BP), whereas AG did not. These data indicate that urinary excretion of intact albumin and albumin-derived fragments in diabetes may be modulated independently of glycemic control (AG and RAM) and systolic BP (RAM). While both drugs are known for their different mechanisms of action, the fact that both prevent diabetes-related increases in glomerular PKC activity and albuminuria supports the hypothesis that PKC plays a central role in the development of diabetic nephropathy.",

    "577": "Experimental studies suggest that the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and its primary effector peptide, angiotensin II (Ang II), are involved in the pathophysiology of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. All the components required for Ang II production are present in the heart, and cardiac Ang II formation appears to be regulated independent from the circulating RAS. In animal models and in patients with heart failure, the cardiac RAS is activated and, presumably, local Ang II formation is enhanced. Several cardiac cell types express Ang II type 1 (AT1) and/or type 2 (AT2)-receptors and represent potential targets for Ang II-mediated effects. In neonatal cardiac myocytes, Ang II induces a hypertrophic response via the AT1-receptor. Likewise, activation of the AT1-receptor triggers hypertrophy in terminally differentiated cardiac myocytes and in perfused heart preparations. In the neonatal system, Ang II appears to be a major autocrine/paracrine mediator of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy in response to passive mechanical stretch. By contrast, AT1-receptor activation apparently is not required to trigger load-induced hypertrophy in the adult cardiomyocyte. Recent studies suggest that the AT2-receptor opposes AT1-receptor-mediated growth signals in neonatal and in adult cardiac myocytes. Pharmacological studies have established that a blockade of the RAS at the level of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) or the AT1-receptor ameliorates the remodeling process of the heart and prolongs long-term survival in animal models of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. The therapeutic effects of ACE inhibitors and AT1-receptor antagonists clearly suggest an important role for the ACE-Ang II-AT1-receptor axis in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. It must be kept in mind, however, that these drugs enhance AT2-receptor and B2-kinin receptor-dependent signaling pathways which may contribute significantly to the beneficial effects observed in vivo. Molecular and physiological analyses of transgenic mice with a cardiac-specific overexpression of the AT1 or AT2-receptor confirm that AT1 and AT2-receptor-dependent signaling cascades potently modulate cardiac myocyte function and growth. However, studies in AT1-receptor knockout mice demonstrate that cardiac hypertrophy in response to hemodynamic overload can occur independent from the AT1-receptor. In this paper, we review recent experimental evidence suggesting a critical role for the RAS in cardiac hypertrophy and failure with special emphasis on the putative role of Ang II and Ang II-receptor signaling in cardiac myocytes.", 
    "578": "Angiotensin II (ANG II) mediated hypertension accelerates atherosclerosis (AS) and thereby increases the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI). On the other hand, superoxide anion (O2-) is involved in the modification of low density lipoproteins, inhibition of prostacyclin (PGI2) formation and breakdown of nitric oxide. These events finally lead to rapid progression of AS and MI. In the present study, we investigate whether ANG II can induce O2- release from human vascular endothelial cells (HVECs) and the possible mechanisms involved.", 
    "579": "The expression of ANG receptors subtype-1 (AT-1) and subtype-2 (AT-2) were identified by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis. The O2- production was dose-dependently increased in HVECs treated with ANG II (10(-7)-10(-9) M) and with a maximum rate after 1 h of incubation. This event was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the specific AT-1 blocker losartan (10(-7) M) and to a lesser extent by the specific AT-2 receptor blocker PD123319 (10(-7) M). The combined incubation of both receptor blockers was even more effective. In addition, our lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay showed that the activity of plasma membrane-bound NADH-/NADPH-oxidases derived from ANG II-treated cells was also significantly increased, this effect was reduced in cells pretreated with losartan or to lesser extent by PD123319. However, the activity of xanthine oxidase remained unchanged in response to ANG II. Furthermore, the basal O2- release from HVECs was inhibited in cells treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, Lisinopril (10(-6) M), and this event could be reversed by ANG II.", 
    "580": "ANG II induces O2- release in HVECs via activation of membrane-bound NADH-/NADPH-oxidase, an effect, that is mediated by both AT-1 and AT-2 receptors. This suggests that acceleration of AS and MI in ANG II-mediated hypertension may at least be due to ANG II-induced O2- generation from vascular endothelial cells.

Animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have been used to characterize more fully insulitis, and our results with C57/BL/Ks mdb with low doses of streptozotocin (STZ) confirmed the disease. B1 receptor antagonist [Leu8]des-Arg9-BK has shown a significant effect on diabetic glycemia and renal control parameters. Compared to insulin, the drug was effective to prevent the insulitis and the renal damage. On the other hand, B2 receptor antagonist (HOE 140) and ACE-I (captopril) were only able to control the urinary diabetic proteinuria.", 
    "582": "RMP-7 is a bradykinin (BK) agonist designed to be resistant to kininases such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Pharmacological assays were performed with RMP-7 in isolated guinea-pig ileum and rat mesenteric artery. RMP-7 induced contractile responses in the guinea-pig ileum, where the apparent affinity of the peptide (pD2) was significantly lower than that determined for BK (7.3 +/- 0.07 vs. 8.3 +/- 0.05, respectively). HOE-140 blocked this effect indicating that B2 receptor was involved. Captopril (1 microM) had no potentiating effect on RMP-7 but increased pD2 value determined for BK (8.8 +/- 0.1), confirming a high resistance of RMP-7 to the ACE. In rat mesenteric artery, RMP-7 induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (7.8 +/- 0.4), with a higher affinity than that of BK which induced vasodilatation only in the presence of 1 microM captopril (6.9 +/- 0.36). Nevertheless, the maximum effect induced by RMP-7 was lower than that of BK in contrast to that observed in guinea-pig ileum although B2 receptor was involved in both cases. We concluded that: RMP-7 is greatly resistant to the ACE and that the receptor sites activated by RMP-7 and BK show important differences in vascular and non-vascular preparations probably due to the different sensitivity of the B2 receptor to RMP-7.", 
    "583": "A 85-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus and prior myocardial infarction was transferred to the emergency room with loss of consciousness due to marked bradycardia caused by hyperkalemia. The T wave during right ventricular pacing was tall and tent-shaped while the concentration of serum potassium was high, and its amplitude during pacing was decreased after correction of the serum potassium level. Simultaneously with the correction, normal sinus rhythm was restored. The cause of hyperkalemia was considered to be several doses of loxoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), prescribed for her lumbago by an orthopedic specialist, in addition to the long-term intake of imidapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), prescribed for her hypertension by a cardiologist. This case warns physicians that the combination of NSAID and ACEI can produce serious side effects in aged patients who frequently suffer from hypertension, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and degenerative joint disease.", 
    "584": "We review the different cardiovascular effects exerted by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, obtained in several experimental and clinical studies in the last twenty years, in patients with arterial hypertension and different cardiovascular pathologies related to the hypertensive process. We will review the mechanistic basis of the cardiovascular protective effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. These drugs, as monotherapy or combined therapy, can achieve blood pressure control in a high proportion of hypertensive patients; in hypertensive patients with diabetes these drugs are especially indicated, and also are the drugs of choice in diabetic hypertensive patients with cardiac dysfunction due to ischaemic cardiomyopathy. This group of drugs has the highest effect among the drugs available today in reducing left ventricular hypertrophy associated with the hypertensive process. There are many experimental and clinical data that suggest the potential role of the angiotensin converting enzyme antagonists limiting the atherosclerotic process.", 
    "585": "Despite the availability of many newer antihypertensive agents, hypertensive patients remain at a higher risk of premature death than the general population. This persistence of elevated morbidity and mortality may be accounted for by the frequent failure to achieve adequate blood pressure reduction despite an extensive range of available antihypertensive agents. Such considerations have led to the reassessment of the potential role of fixed-dose combination agents. The antihypertensive efficacy may be enhanced when two classes of agents are combined. In addition, combination therapy enhances tolerability because one drug of fixed combination can antagonize some of the adverse effects of the second drug. Fixed-dose combination therapy simplifies the treatment regimen, preventing treatment failures that might result from missed doses.", 
    "586": "Advances in scientific research over the last century have permitted the recognition and characterization of the structure and function of an enzymatic pathway involved in cardiovascular homeostasis and blood pressure control, namely the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This system may be reversibly blocked by drugs acting at different levels: renin inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Lacking clinical experience with effects of AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonists on the cardiovascular system are practically identical to those observed with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The efficacy and safety of drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in the reduction of blood pressure, the regression of cardiovascular remodeling, the prevention of progression of diabetic nephropathy to end-stage renal failure, and the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality is well established. These hemodynamic effects of AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonists treatment are achieved with less adverse effects than with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Furthermore, the association of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and AT1 angiotensin II receptor antagonists allows a more effective renin-angiotensin-aldosterone Systems blockade and improves the hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic effects. This possibility opens up new perspectives in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, the most common cause of death at the end of the millennium in developed countries.", 
    "587": "Blood pressure, as well as other biological parameters, shows a circadian rhythm with a morning increase following the nocturnal blood pressure fall. In a parallel way, and probably related, there is a characteristic morning concentration of cardiovascular events. The antihypertensive treatment should pursue normotension during the 24 hours of the day, by restrictive the morning blood pressure increase. Drug efficacy can be improved depending on the time of the day of drug dose. Chronotherapeutical effects of different drugs in blood pressure are discussed.", 
    "588": "Arterial hypertension is a cardinal precursor of congestive heart failure, and diastolic dysfunction is the most frequent mechanism for it. Systolic left ventricular dysfunction, although less frequent, has a worse prognosis. Most cases of systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertension is due to acute myocardial infarction, although other mechanisms can be involved. In some studies, non-ischemic hypertensive systolic dysfunction is the etiology of chronic heart failure in up to 10% of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Diastolic dysfunction and left ventricular hypertrophy are also associated with a higher risk of heart failure and systolic dysfunction. Given the poor prognosis of patients with congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy, it is fundamental to try to prevent the development of left ventricular dysfunction by means of a correct control of blood pressure, regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and prevention of coronary artery disease. When systolic dysfunction is established, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors are the treatment of choice; diuretics and digoxin can be added in patients with overt congestive heart failure. Recent studies suggest that other drugs, such as carvedilol and losartan, can be beneficial, but current evidence is still scarce.",

Management of this dog following treatment with Fab fragments was complicated by hypomagnesemia and loss of the positive inotropic effect of digoxin.", 
    "590": "Hyperkalaemia is a frequent electrolyte disturbance connected with new knowledge and practical routine. It is developed by the disorders of the \"external balance\" (potassium [K] intake and output) as well as the \"internal balance\" (distribution of K in the extracellular and intracellular fluid compartments). Factors playing a role in it are: the upright posture, physical activity and hyperosmolality. In the hormonal regulation of K metabolism first of all beta adrenergic agents, insulin and aldosterone have significance; the first two mainly in the internal balance. Hyperkalaemia is occurring especially frequently in renal patients (in acute and chronic renal insufficiency, in dialyzed persons) in patients with diabetes, in adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, in selective hypoaldosteronisms and in pseudohypoaldosteronisms) in renal tubular acidosis as well as in response to various drugs (ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, beta blocking agents, potassium sparing diuretics, NSAID's, anticoagulants etc.). Interactions between illness and drugs as well as between drugs and hormones may have outstanding importance in the development of hyperkalaemia. Physical activity carried out in the upright posture in the presence of hyperosmolality (water restriction together with salt or/and glucose loading) developing in pharmacological hypoaldosteronism accompanied with insulin deficiency, may be especially dangerous with respect to hyperkalaemia. To avoid life-threatening hyperkalaemia it is necessary 1. to stop cardiotoxicity with calcium; 2. to enhance K uptake by the cells by bicarbonate, insulin and beta adrenergic agents; and 3. to remove abnormal quantities of K from the body by enemas and/or ion exchange resins. The quickest and best way of treatment of hyperkalaemia is haemodialysis.",

Plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of aldosterone, norepinephrine, atrial natriuretic peptide, angiotensin II, tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6 and interleukin-1B were assessed at 6 months of ACE inhibitor therapy. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 24+/-5% and the end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters were 59+/-9 and 71+/-8 mm, respectively. Despite chronic enalapril or captopril therapy, 35 patients (50%) had increased plasma angiotensin II (median 33 pg. ml(-1), range 17-84), while it was in the normal range in the remaining 35 patients (median 10 pg. ml(-1), range 5-15).

Multivariate regression analysis identified the plasma renin activity (0.0004), norepinephrine (0.02) and interleukin-6 (0.03) as independent predictors of plasma angiotensin II. During follow-up (35+/-29 months), nine (12.8%) patients died and 13 had new heart failure episodes.

The aims of this study were to investigate 1) the endothelial cell capacity to convert Ang I to Ang II, 2) the effects of endocrine and paracrine/autocrine factors on Ang II production in microvascular endothelial cells (MVE) derived from the developing corpora lutea (CL), and 3) the relationship between Ang II peptide concentration and expression of mRNA for angiotensin type 1 and 2 receptors (ATR1 and AT2R) in the bovine CL at different stages of the estrous cycle. When Ang I was added to the MVE at a concentration of 10(-9) M, it was converted to Ang II (21%). The production of Ang II from Ang I time-dependently rose for 24 h. Addition of captopril (an inhibitor of Ang-converting enzyme [ACE]) to the MVE cultures significantly inhibited Ang II production from 6 h to 24 h (P < 0.05). Addition of estradiol-17beta (E(2)) + vascular endothelial growth factor and E(2) + basic fibroblast growth factor to MVE cultures increased Ang II production, whereas E(2) or growth factors alone had no effect. Specific transcription for AT1R and AT2R was detected in bovine CL and MVE. There were no significant changes in Ang II tissue concentration or AT1R mRNA expression using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction during the estrous cycle. In contrast, AT2R mRNA expression decreased during the midluteal phase (P < 0.05) and increased to the highest level during the late luteal phase (P < 0.05). Results demonstrated that Ang II is generated from Ang I in MVE isolated from the developing bovine CL, indicating that MVE have ACE activity. In addition, mRNA expression for Ang II receptors was detected in the bovine CL and the luteal MVE. These results suggest that Ang II is produced by actions of the local renin-angiotensin system, at least in part, on MVE in the bovine CL, and that this peptide may be involved in the regulation of luteal function during early development and luteolysis.", 
    "603": "We examined the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on oxygen radical production before and generation after phorbol-myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation of lung alveolar macrophages. Lung free cells, predominantly pulmonary alveolar macrophages, were obtained from Fischer 344 rats and guinea pigs using bronchoalveolar lavage. The oxygen radicals produced by pulmonary alveolar macrophages with or without stimulation of PMA were measured by lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence method using a photon counter, Lumat 9501 (Berthold, Germany). Alacepril, an ACE inhibitor with SH-group, inhibited the oxygen radical production and generation by lung alveolar macrophages harvested from both rats and guinea pigs in a dose-dependent fashion. Approximately 0.3 mM of alacepril inhibited 50% of oxygen radical production of lung alveolar macrophages in both rats and guinea pigs, whereas a higher concentration (1-5 mM) of lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor without SH-group, was necessary to inhibit 50% of oxygen radical production of lung alveolar macrophages in the animals. These results suggest that an ACE inhibitor with SH-group acts as an antioxidant in murine lungs and the treatment with the ACE inhibitor may reduce oxidant stress in hypertensive patients with asthma.",

Primary care physicians were more likely to monitor patients for overt proteinuria (86%) than microalbuminuria (58%). Of the physicians who claimed to monitor patients for microalbuminuria, 39% chose inappropriate methods for detection, which lowers the percentage of physicians who correctly monitored for microalbuminuria to 37%.

Its increasing incidence and prevalence may be in part explained by the progressive aging of the world population. The improvement in coronary artery disease and hypertension treatment allows the individuals to lie longer and develop CHF. Indeed, the most common etiology of CHF is coronary artery disease, the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the second cause of CHF is hypertension which is still markedly increasing in developing countries. Estimates of prevalence of CHF are 0.4 to 2% of the general population. The number of hospital admissions for CHF has also been steadily increasing. Half of the patients carrying a diagnosis of CHF will die within 4 years and patients with severe CHF will die within 1 year. At present, there is no evidence that the prognosis of heart failure in the community has changed despite the advances in therapy over the past decades, such as the demonstration that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and other vasodilators improve the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with CHF, reduce mortality and slow the progression of myocardial dysfunction. Nevertheless, the overall mortality from this condition remains very high. It is possible that the results of the trials have not yet been evidenced in the majority of patients with CHF because the ideal conditions, treatment and follow-up in the trials are not yet widely achieved in the population.",

Data from studies of the therapeutic use of beta-blockers in patients following acute myocardial infarction suggest that in this circumstance these agents confer at least as much benefit to patients with heart failure as they do to those without. Similarly retrospective analysis of a number of the studies of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in heart failure suggest a greater effect of the combination of beta-blocker with ACE inhibitor compared with ACE inhibitor alone. The results of recent prospective, placebo-controlled studies of the addition of beta-blocker to standard therapy in patients with chronic heart failure have confirmed a significant beneficial effect. beta-blocker therapy in these studies was well tolerated and in addition to improved mortality, beta-blocker therapy is associated with improved morbidity in terms of progressive heart failure and numbers of hospitalizations. Initiation of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure may be associated with deterioration of cardiac function in the short term. Treatment should be started at a low dose of beta-blocker with slow up-titration in a number of steps over several weeks. In spite of the established benefits of ACE inhibition in patients with heart failure, this treatment is under-utilized. Part of this shortfall is due to physicians' perceptions regarding potential unwanted effects of ACE inhibition. Perceptions regarding unwanted effects of beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy are likely to be at least as great. While beta-blockade represents a welcome addition to the therapeutic armoury of physicians caring for patients with heart failure, initiation and stabilization of beta-adrenoceptor blocker therapy should be undertaken under specialist supervision.", 
    "643": "Maintenance of constant drug levels in the body for those drugs that are used in management of hypertension is extremely beneficial. This can be successfully achieved by delivering the antihypertensives as osmotically-controlled drug-delivery system that essentially eliminates the influence of pH on the drug release. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the main effects of the formulation variables on the release of captopril from osmotically-controlled drug-delivery system coated with a custom-made cellulose acetate (CA) pseudolatex reported earlier. A secondary objective was to identify a suitable antioxidant for incorporating in the formulation as the drug undergoes metal-catalyzed oxidative degradation. The drug showed good stability (> or = 90% intact captopril) in solution in the presence of ascorbic acid for a period of 48 h. A seven-factor, 12-run Plackett-Burman screening design was employed to study the main effects of amounts of Polyox(R) N10 and N80, Carbopol(R) 934P and 974P, sodium chloride, orifice size, and % coating weight gain. The response variable was cumulative percent of drug released in 12 h, Y(3), with constraints on lag time Y(1) and time for 50% drug released Y(2)amount of sodium chloride (1.97).", 
    "644": "The purpose of Medicare's Cooperative Cardiovascular Project (CCP) is to improve the care of Medicare patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). MetaStar is Wisconsin's Medicare peer review organization that administers Phase II of the CCP. A major Phase II objective is to increase the use of reperfusion strategies (thrombolysis and angioplasty) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (when the ejection fractions is < 40%) in patients presenting with AMI. After MetaStar presented Wausau Hospital's baseline Phase II data to us, we were asked to define a plan to improve the use of reperfusion therapy and ACE inhibitors. To verify the accuracy of the data presented to us, we reviewed the patient records used by MetaStar to calculate our baseline data for these 2 quality-of-care indicators. Our MetaStar reported reperfusion rate (48.4%) and ACE inhibitor rate (20.9%) were significantly different from that which we calculated (100% and 97%). Causes for the discrepancy included MetaStar abstractor's failure to exclude two patients who did not have an AMI, failure to correctly count patients who received the targeted treatment, and an inability of the abstractors to identify important CCP exclusion criteria. Thus, numerous patients who should have been excluded were inappropriately classified as \"ideal\" candidates for the targeted therapy. WE CONCLUDE: There are major flaws in the data collection techniques used by MetaStar in Phase II of the CCP. These flaws produced erroneous conclusions concerning our use of reperfusion strategies and ACE inhibitors. Since these quality-of-care indicators are major targeted goals of Phase II, the errors are of special concern. We believe better-designed abstract forms, due diligence, and more thorough training could have prevented the errors. In presenting our concerns, we hope to foster a response by MetaStar to improve the quality of the peer review process.", 
    "645": "Specific direct radioimmunoassay of angiotensin II (AT II) in human plasma was developed to evaluate the dynamics of endogenous AT II in various types of hypertension. Detection limit of this method was less than 2.3 pg/ml, and normal value is less than 25 pg/ml. Cross reactivity of antibody with AT I and III was 0.037% and 21%, respectively. There were good correlation between the value measured by direct method, and that of extraction method (r = 0.96, P < 0.01) and plasma renin activity (r = 0.80, P < 0.01). By oral administration of ACE inhibitor (captopril 50 mg), AT II levels were suppressed to 10 pg/ml or less in most patients with essential hypertension, renal parenchymal hypertension and renovascular hypertension up to 2 h. However, AT II levels in patients treated with ACE inhibitors chronically were not different from the AT II levels in patients without ACE inhibitor. In primary aldosteronism AT II was extremely low levels. AT II markedly increased by the stimulation test using furosemide (1 mg/kg i.v.). These results suggest that this method may be useful to clarify the pathophysiology of hypertension and the escape of the inhibition by ACE inhibitor.", 
    "646": "It is well-known that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor not only decreases blood pressure (BP) but also improves insulin sensitivity. To elucidate the mechanisms of these actions of ACE inhibitor, we evaluated its effect on both BP and insulin sensitivity (M-value) as estimated by the glucose clamp technique in essential hypertensives in comparison with the effect of angiotensin receptor (AT) antagonist. We also evaluated the effect of ACE inhibitor on BP, M-value and muscle fiber composition in fructose-fed rats (FFR) as an insulin-resistant hypertensive model with or without treatment with Hoe 140 (kinin receptor antagonist). In essential hypertensives, both ACE inhibitor and AT antagonist decreased BP and improved insulin sensitivity to the same extent. In FFR, ACE inhibitor also decreased BP and improved insulin sensitivity. Moreover, Hoe 140 showed no effect on these actions of ACE inhibitor. The composite ratio of type I fiber of soleus muscle was decreased significantly in FFR compared to control and ACE inhibitor produced a recovery of the composite ratio of type I fiber to the same as control. These results suggested that muscle fiber composition of skeletal muscle is linked to insulin resistance, and that ACE inhibitor may modulate muscle fiber composition through its vasodilative effect in hypertension. These results also suggest that for vasodilation, it is more important to inhibit angiotensin II than to block degradation of kinins or to improve insulin sensitivity by ACE inhibitor.", 
    "647": "We have previously reported that the renal kallikrein-kinin system suppressed the development of hypertension, using kininogen deficient Brown Norway Katholiek rats. Kinins were degraded in urine mainly by carboxypeptidase Y-like kininase (CPY). Blockade of renal kinin degradation may prevent the experimental hypertension through the facilitation of the renal kallikrein-kinin system. Daily administration of ebelactone B (EB), which is isolated from Actinomycetes and strongly inhibits CPY, from the first day of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt treatment for 4 weeks completely blocked hypertension in Sprague-Dawley rats. This treatment reduced sodium levels in erythrocytes and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) significantly. By contrast, an ACE inhibitor, lisinopril did not prevent hypertension. The development of hypertension in young spontaneously hypertensive rats was also blunted by EB with reductions in sodium levels in erythrocytes and in CSF. The arterial kinin levels in rats undergoing DOCA-salt treatment were 2.2 +/- 0.2 pg/ml, which were increased significantly to 4.6 +/- 0.4 pg/ml with captopril (10 mg/kg, s.c.). The increased kinin levels were less than those to show hypotension. EB did not increase the arterial kinin levels, with significant increase in urinary kinin secretion. These results suggested that facilitation of the renal kallikrein-kinin system by inhibition of kinin degradation on the luminal side of the renal tubules may effectively prevent hypertension.", 
    "648": "It has been previously documented that the thermolysin-digest of \"Katsuo-bushi\", a Japanese traditional food processed from dried bonito possesses potent inhibitory activity against angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE). The present authors isolated eight kinds of ACE-inhibitory peptides from it. Of these isolated peptides, LKPNM (IC50 = 2.4 microM) was found to be hydrolyzed by ACE to produce LKP (IC50 = 0.32 microM) with 8-fold higher ACE-inhibitory activity relative to the parent peptide or LKPNM, suggesting that LKPNM can be regarded as a prodrug-type ACE-inhibitory peptide. For assessment of relative antihypertensive activities of LKPNM and LKP to that of captopril, they were orally administered to SHR rats to monitor time-course changes of blood pressures, whereby it was evidenced that both LKPNM and captopril showed maximal decrease of blood pressure 4 h after oral administration and their efficacies lasted until 6 h post-administration. In sharp contrast, however, maximal reduction of blood pressure occurred as early as 2 h after administration of LKP. Minimum effective doses of LKPNM, LKP and captopril were 8, 2.25 and 1.25 mg/kg, respectively. When compared on molar basis, antihypertensive activities of LKPNM and LKP accounted for 66% and 91% relative to that of captopril, respectively, whereas in vitro ACE-inhibitory activities of LKPNM and LKP were no more than 0.92% and 7.73% compared with that of captopril (IC50 = 0.022 microM). It is of interest to note that both of these peptides exert remarkably higher antihypertensive activities in vivo despite weaker in vitro ACE-inhibitory effects, which was ascertained by using captopril as the reference drug.", 
    "649": "It is known that BK does play a role in the cardioprotective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. The present study therefore was conducted to examine the effects of bradykinin (BK) and its antagonist on survival time in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with coronary artery ligation for 15 min and continuously. We also evaluated the heart rate and blood pressure (BP) in the presence and absence of BK and BK2 receptor antagonist, D-Arg-[Hyp-D-Phe7]BK. Coronary artery was ligated in anaesthetized rats and they were artificially ventilated with room air (stroke volume, 4 ml; 48 strokes/min) as described by the previous investigators. Lead II elecrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded from subcutaneous steel needle electrodes. Results of this investigation indicated that BK treatment 4 microg/kg (i.v.) and 8 microg/kg (i.v.) caused significant (P < 0.05) increase in survival time in SHR with coronary artery ligation for 15 min and continuously as compare to their respective saline-treated controls. However, BK antagonist treatment 4 microg/kg (i.v.) abolished the increase in survival time caused by BK treatment. The mean values of survival time between the saline-treated and BK antagonist plus BK-treated rats did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). The heart rate and BP responses were greatly reduced (P < 0.001) in the presence of coronary artery ligation. These findings suggest that BK might have cardioprotective effect to increase the survival time in rats by activating BK2 receptors after coronary artery ligation.", 
    "650": "Hypertension in chronic progressive renal disease is a major clinical problem leading to renal function loss. We studied the influence of ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and the effect of hypertension therapy on renal function in 116 patients with chronic glomerulonephritis. Patients were subdivided as hypertensive, normotensive and hypotensive according to the level of ABP and age. Hypotensive subjects showed improvement of renal function and normotensive subjects showed slower rate of progression of renal function loss than hypertensives, suggesting the adequate level of ABP was 100-125/55-75 mm Hg in patients less than 40 years old, 100-135/60-80 mm Hg in patients 40-60 years old, and 105-140/60-85 mm Hg in patients over 60 years, respectively. The renal protection of calcium antagonists was associated with achieving lower blood pressure levels, whereas the blood pressure level did not affect progression of renal function in patient treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitor, but not calcium antagonists, showed a reduction of urinary protein excretion. Thus, the mechanisms of renal protection were different between ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists.", 
    "651": "Cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition have been demonstrated in postischemic reperfusion. This occurred via bradykinin and indirect evidence suggested mediation by nitric oxide (NO), which probably acts as a radical scavenger. To test this hypothesis, we measured release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from isolated guinea pig hearts (constant flow perfusion, 37 degrees C) as a marker of cellular damage, before and after global ischemia (15 min), and we investigated the release of NO during reperfusion, both, without and with ACE inhibition. The main catabolites of NO, nitrate and nitrite, were also quantified. Coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) indicated coronary resistance changes. Cilazaprilat (CIL, 10 microM) was used for inhibition of ACE. Marked and protracted cellular damage occurred during reperfusion in the control group, myocardial LDH release rising nearly 10-fold from 1.5 mU/ml (basal level) to 14 mU/ml during acute reperfusion, then declining to 7 mU/ml after 5 min. ACE inhibition mitigated the acute rise of LDH (9 mU/ml), and reduced its release to preischemic values already after 3 min of reperfusion. Postischemic NO release in the 2nd min of reperfusion was about 40% of the preischemic value (approx. 200 nM) in untreated hearts, while there was 70% recovery after ACE inhibition. After 25 min, NO had recovered to 69% in controls vs. 100% with CIL. Coronary venous nitrate + nitrite was not infringed during early reperfusion (2nd min). After 25 min, nitrate + nitrite had decreased in controls (about 75% of preischemic values), but increased to 110% with CIL. In control hearts, CPP rose continuously from the 10th to the 25th min of reperfusion (from 39 to 55 mmHg), indicating progressive vasoconstriction. CIL significantly attenuated this effect. The results suggest that NO might be consumed during early reperfusion in the act of detoxifying radicals. In control hearts, \"endothelial stunning\" takes place. Concerning NO production and vasodilatory tone, ACE-inhibition augments postischemic NO release and mitigates disturbances caused by ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "652": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor associated angioedema was detected in 39 subjects (17%) of 231 consecutive patients examined in the last 5 years at our out-patient clinic for symptoms of angioedema without urticaria. In these patients, angioedema was most commonly localized to the face. The duration of ACE-inhibitor treatment at the onset of angioedema ranged from 1 day to 8 years with a median of 6 months. The time elapsed between onset of angioedema and withdrawal of ACE-inhibitor ranged from 1 day to 10 years with a median of 10 months. Delayed diagnosis is explained by the unusual characteristics of this adverse reaction: angioedema may start years after beginning the treatment and then it recurs irregularly. In fact, ACE-inhibitors seem to facilitate angioedema in predisposed subjects, rather than causing it with an allergic or idiosyncratic mechanism. Thus, while Cl-inhibitor levels are usually normal in subjects developing ACE-inhibitor-dependent angioedema, we found that ACE-inhibitors caused angioedema in Cl-inhibitor-deficient patients. Because the main inactivator of bradykinin is kininase II, which is identical with ACE, it is believed that bradykinin mediates ACE-inhibitor-dependent angioedema. We had the possibility to examine the plasma bradykinin levels in one ACE-inhibitor-treated patient during an angioedema attack and we found very high levels, but we did not find an increase of break-down products of high-molecular-weight-kininogen as observed during acute attacks in hereditary angioedema. Bradykinin fell to normal levels during remission after withdrawal of the drug. These observations indicate that in ACE-inhibitor-induced angioedema, contrary to hereditary angioedema, the reduction of bradykinin catabolic rate plays a predominant role.", 
    "653": "Empirical antiarrhythmic therapy has not reduced mortality among patients with coronary artery disease and asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. Previous studies have suggested that antiarrhythmic therapy guided by electrophysiologic testing might reduce the risk of sudden death.",

Patients in whom sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced by programmed stimulation were randomly assigned to receive either antiarrhythmic therapy, including drugs and implantable defibrillators, as indicated by the results of electrophysiologic testing, or no antiarrhythmic therapy. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and beta-adrenergic-blocking agents were administered if the patients could tolerate them.", 
    "655": "A total of 704 patients with inducible, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were randomly assigned to treatment groups. Five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of the primary end point of cardiac arrest or death from arrhythmia were 25 percent among those receiving electrophysiologically guided therapy and 32 percent among the patients assigned to no antiarrhythmic therapy (relative risk, 0.73; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.99), representing a reduction in risk of 27 percent). The five-year estimates of overall mortality were 42 percent and 48 percent, respectively (relative risk, 0.80; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 1.01). The risk of cardiac arrest or death from arrhythmia among the patients who received treatment with defibrillators was significantly lower than that among the patients discharged without receiving defibrillator treatment (relative risk, 0.24; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.13 to 0.45; P<0.001). Neither the rate of cardiac arrest or death from arrhythmia nor the overall mortality rate was lower among the patients assigned to electrophysiologically guided therapy and treated with antiarrhythmic drugs than among the patients assigned to no antiarrhythmic therapy.",

    "657": "Angioedema (AE) associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is a rare, but potentially life-threatening adverse reaction. Several studies have suggested that bradykinin (BK) is responsible for ACEi-induced AE, but the mechanism remains unclear. We investigated the metabolism of BK and des-Arg9-BK in the serum of 20 patients with a history of ACEi-associated AE and 21 control (C) subjects. Synthetic BK was incubated with the sera for various periods of time and residual BK and generated des-Arg9-BK were quantified by specific and sensitive enzyme immunoassays. No significant difference of half-life (t1/2) of both BK and des-Arg9-BK could be measured between C subjects and patients with AE (AE) in absence of ACEi. However, an analysis according to the prolonged (+) or not (-) t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK allowed a new stratification of C subjects and AE patients in four subgroups. The preincubation of sera with enalaprilat at a concentration inhibiting ACE significantly prevented the rapid degradation of BK and des-Arg9-BK in these four subgroups. In presence of ACEi, a subgroup (50%) of AE patients (AE + ) had a particularly significant rise of the t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK. Once ACE was inhibited, the concentration or the nature of the ACEi had no significant effect on the t1/2 of des-Arg9-BK. However, a test dilution of AE + sera with a control (C) serum showed that an enzyme defect rather than a circulating inhibitor could be responsible for the abnormal metabolism of des-Arg9-BK when ACE is inhibited. In conclusion, half of the patients with ACEi-associated AE present in serum had an enzyme defect involved in the des-Arg9-BK metabolism leading to its accumulation. The B1 agonist could be responsible, at least in part, for the local inflammatory reaction associated with the AE.", 
    "658": "Increased permeability of glomerular capillary wall in adriamycin nephropathy may be mediated by increased generation of free radicals and possibly also by the non-enzymatic production of isoprostanes induced by oxidative stress. ACE inhibitors may reduce proteinuria, possibly due to the decrease of intraglomerular pressure and increased permselectivity of the glomerular capillary wall. These effects may be partly mediated by the inhibition of the degradation of kinins. It is not clear if newly available angiotensin II antagonists have the same antiproteinuric and renoprotective effects.", 
    "659": "We compared the effect of an ACE inhibitor (enalapril, 0.4 mg/kg bw i.p. daily for 3 weeks) and angiotensin II antagonist (losartan, 2 mg/kg bw in the same way) on experimental nephrotic syndrome induced in rats by the administration of adriamycin (5 mg/kg bw i.v. in a single dose). To elucidate the potential differences between these two drugs we also measured total malondialdehyde in blood and urinary excretion some eicosanoids and their metabolites (TxB2, 6-keto-PGF1alfa, bicyclo-PGE2 and 8-isoprostane). Proteinuria increased in adriamycin treated rats after 3 weeks from 0.18 +/- 0.01 to 0.44 +/- 0.14 g/mmol creat, p < 0.01. This increase was not prevented by losartan (increase from 0.18 +/- 0.12 to 0.50 +/- 0.11 g/mmol creat, p < 0.05), but tended to be partly blunted by enalapril (increase from 0.20 +/- 0.10 to only 0.32 +/- 0.08 g/mmol creat, p < 0.05). Similarly there was no increase of serum cholesterol, only in enalapril treated rats. On the other hand, both losartan (1.27 +/- 0.13 vs. 1.91 +/- 0.30 mumol/l, p < 0.05) and enalapril (0.93 +/- 0.06 mumol/l, p < 0.001) prevented adriamycin induced increase of total MDA in serum, but urinary excretion of 8-isoprostane was increased in nephrotic rats treated by losartan compared to controls. Enalapril induced increase of urinary excretion of bicyclo-PGE2 (4.32 +/- 0.62 vs. 1.66 +/- 0.81 ng/mmol creat, p < 0.001) was possibly mediated by kinins. There was no significant difference in the urinary excretion of other eicosanoids between different groups, but proteinuria correlated positively with urinary excretion of 8-isoprostane (p < 0.01). Proteinuric rats had also significantly higher urinary excretion of 8-isoprostane than non-proteinuric rats (44.8 +/- 7.1 vs. 26.7 +/- 3.4 ng/mmol. creat, p < 0.05).", 
    "660": "Our data suggest that proteinuria in adriamycin nephropathy may mainly depend on free radical generation and the formation of 8-isoprostane. Haemodynamic parameters (glomerular pressure) do not seem to be so important. The mild antiproteinuric effect of enalapril may suggest a contributory role of the inhibition of kinin degradation in this model of nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "661": "Drugs used mainly for the treatment of hypertension, such as angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, can cause pancytopenia. The underlying cause of this side effect remains unknown. In the present study, long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMCs) were utilized to evaluate the role of captopril (D-3-mercapto-2-methylpropionyl-L-proline), one of the potent ACE inhibitors, in regulating hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell proliferation. Captopril (10(-6) M final concentration) was added to LTBMCs at the beginning of the culture period and at weekly intervals for six weeks. There was no toxicity to the bone marrow cells as measured by the unchanged cell number in the nonadherent layer during the whole culture period, and there was an increased cellularity of the adherent layer at the end of the six weeks of treatment. However, captopril decreased the proportion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFCs) in S phase at weeks 2 and 3 as well as that of high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFCs) at week 3 in the nonadherent layer. There was no change in the kinetics of the GM-CFCs and HPP-CFCs present in the adherent layer. These results suggest that captopril causes myelosuppression by inhibiting hematopoietic cell proliferation of progenitor and stem cells rather than depleting cells of the bone marrow microenvironment.", 
    "662": "The results of the HOPE (\"Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation\") study were presented at the XXIst Congress of the European Society of Cardiology in Barcelona (August 28-September 1, 1999). In addition, results obtained in the large diabetic sub-population (38% of the 9541 patients included in the trial) were reported at the XXXVth Congress of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Brussels (September 28-October 2, 1999). The HOPE trial was terminated early because of a reduction of the relative risk (-22%, p < 0.000002) of major cardiovascular events in the group treated with ramipiril compared to the group receiving placebo. Such a favourable effect of ramipril was observed in non-diabetic subjects in secondary prevention and in diabetic patients in secondary or primary prevention. In the latter population, a significant reduction in the incidence of microangiopathic complications (nephropathy and retinopathy) was also demonstrated.", 
    "663": "Bradykinin is a nonapeptide that contributes to the cardioprotective effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. During ACE inhibition, an increased proportion of bradykinin is degraded through non-ACE pathways. Studies in animals suggest that aminopeptidase P (EC 3.4.11.9) may contribute to the metabolism of bradykinin. The purpose of the present study was to determine the contribution of aminopeptidase P to the degradation of bradykinin in humans in the presence and absence of ACE inhibition. To do this, we measured the wheal response to intradermal injection of bradykinin (0, 1, or 10 nicrog) in the presence or absence of intradermal administration of the specific aminopeptidase P inhibitor apstatin (5 or 10 microg) and oral administration of the ACE inhibitor quinapril (10 mg) in six healthy subjects. Both bradykinin (ANOVA; F = 101.18, P <.001) and apstatin alone (F = 7.01, P =.049) caused a wheal of dose-dependent size. There was no significant interaction between apstatin and bradykinin (F = 4.94, P =.175). Pretreatment with 10 mg of quinapril significantly shifted the dose-response curve for bradykinin to the left (effect of quinapril; F = 77.96, P <.001) and there was significant interaction between quinapril and bradykinin (F = 7.82, P =.041). The effect of quinapril was significantly potentiated by coinjection of 10 microg of apstatin (effect of apstatin; F = 21.60, P =.006), such that there was significant interactive effect of quinapril and apstatin (F = 20.83, P =.006) on the wheal response to bradykinin. Collectively, these data suggest that aminopeptidase P plays a minor role in the degradation of bradykinin in human skin in the absence of ACE inhibition but contributes significantly to the degradation of bradykinin in the presence of ACE inhibition.", 
    "664": "This study was conducted to investigate whether the novel orally active nonpeptide angiotensin II (Ang II) AT(1) receptor antagonist irbesartan interacts with the thromboxane A(2)/prostaglandin endoperoxide H(2) (TxA(2)/PGH(2)) receptor in canine coronary arteries and human platelets. Coronary artery rings were isolated from male dog hearts (n = 18) and isometric tension of vascular rings was measured continuously at optimal basal tension in organ chambers. Autoradiographic binding of [(3)H]SQ29,548, a TxA(2) receptor antagonist, in canine coronary sections was determined. Blood for platelet aggregation studies was collected by venous puncture from healthy human volunteers (n = 6) who were free of aspirin-like agents for at least 2 weeks. Vascular reactivity and platelet aggregation in response to the TxA(2) analogs U46619 and autoradioagraphic receptor binding to the TxA(2) receptor antagonist [(3)H]SQ29,548 were studied with and without irbesartan. The TxA(2) analog U46619 produced dose-dependent vasoconstriction in coronary rings (EC(50) = 11.6 +/- 1.5 nM). Pretreatment with irbesartan inhibited U46619-induced vasoconstriction, and the dose-response curve was shifted to the right in a dose-dependent manner. The EC(50) of U46619 was increased 6- and 35-fold in the presence of 1 and 10 microM of irbesartan without a change of maximal contraction. At 1 microM, irbesartan is 2-fold more potent than the AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan in the inhibition of U46619-induced vasoconstriction in canine coronary arteries. In contrast, neither AT(1) receptor antagonists (CV11974 and valsartan), the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319, nor the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril had any effect on U46619-induced coronary vasoconstriction. Irbesartan did not change potassium chloride-induced vasoconstriction; however, irbesartan did inhibit the vasoconstriction mediated by another TxA(2)/PGH(2) receptor agonist prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)). Neither the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester nor the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had any effect on irbesartan's attenuation of U46619-induced vasoconstriction. Irbesartan specifically reversed U46619-preconstricted coronary artery rings with and without endothelium in a dose-dependent manner. Irbesartan at high concentrations significantly competed for [(3)H]SQ29,548 binding in canine coronary sections. U46619 stimulated dose-dependent human platelet aggregation of platelet-rich plasma. Preincubation with irbesartan significantly inhibited platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. In conclusion, the dual antagonistic actions of irbesartan by acting at both the AT(1) and TxA(2) receptors in blood vessels and platelets may overall enhance its therapeutic profile in the treatment of hypertension, atherosclerosis, and arterial thrombosis.", 
    "665": "beta-Adrenergic stimulation of cardiac L-type Ca(2+) channels is severely impaired in hypertrophied and failing hearts of both experimental animals and humans. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that chronic treatment of renovascular hypertension with captopril restores normal beta-adrenergic responsiveness of L-type Ca(2+) channels in cardiac myocytes. Left ventricular hypertrophy was induced in rabbits by unilateral renal artery banding and contralateral nephrectomy. Beginning at 3 months after banding, hypertensive rabbits were treated with captopril for 3 months. The responsiveness of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) to (+/-)-isoproterenol was investigated with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. (+/-)-Isoproterenol (1 microM) induced an increase of I(Ca,L) at 0 mV of 126 +/- 20% (n = 13) in control myocytes versus 69 +/- 11% (n = 18) in hypertrophied myocytes from rabbits 3 months after banding. The half-maximal activation concentration of (+/-)-isoproterenol was similar between control and hypertrophied myocytes. Forskolin (10 microM) induced a similar percentage of increase of I(Ca,L) in control and hypertrophied myocytes, 109 +/- 13% (n = 12) versus 120 +/- 14% (n = 11) at 0 mV. The responsiveness of I(Ca,L) to (+/-)-isoproterenol remained depressed in untreated hypertensive rabbits. (+/-)-Isoproterenol (1 microM) increased I(Ca, L) at 0 mV by 64 +/- 8% (n = 14) in myocytes isolated from rabbits 6 months after banding versus 111 +/- 15% (n = 16) in age-matched controls. In captopril-treated rabbits, 1 microM (+/-)-isoproterenol increased I(Ca,L) by 110 +/- 11% (n = 17). We conclude that the maximal response of I(Ca,L) to (+/-)-isoproterenol was severely depressed in hypertrophied myocytes. Chronic treatment of renovascular hypertension with captopril can restore normal responsiveness of I(Ca,L) to (+/-)-isoproterenol in cardiac myocytes.",

    "668": "At the end of the follow-up we found a cumulative survival at 5 years of 60%+/-10. Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease were responsible for 92% of deaths. A decrease in creatinine clearance >10 ml/min at 5 years was found in 65% of patients, 3 of whom ended in dialysis. Multivariate analysis of predictors of survival showed that treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) was significantly associated with a favourable outcome (p = 0.019). Conversely, proteinuria had a negative effect. Renal survival was best predicted by the level of renal function at entry (p = 0.02), and was not influenced by pharmacological treatment.",

    "670": "In this study we investigated whether timed administration of drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can be used to blunt the rise in blood pressure that occurs during the transition from the resting to the active period of the day. For this purpose we compared in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) the antihypertensive efficacy of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors captopril (doses: 3, 10, and 30 mg/ kg/6 h) and enalaprilat (0.3 mg/kg/6 h), and the AT1-receptor antagonist losartan (10 mg/kg/6 h) at two different treatment regimens. The antihypertensive drugs were given as a continuous 6-h infusion either during the transition from the dark to light period (DL) or that from the light to dark period (LD) for 5 consecutive days. For all agents, the average 24-h reduction of blood pressure was comparable for the LD or DL treatment regimen. However, the dynamics of the antihypertensive response were markedly different. The increase in blood pressure at awakening could be blunted much more effectively by the LD than DL treatment regimen. Furthermore, as indicated by the trough:peak ratios, blood pressure profiles were flatter with the LD than with the DL regimen. Thus, in SHR, 24-h rhythms of blood pressure can be modulated by timed administration of ACE inhibitors and losartan, such that the early morning rise in blood pressure is suppressed.", 
    "671": "Abnormalities in fibrinolysis have been reported in hypertension. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to improve altered fibrinolytic balance in hypertensive patients. It has not been documented, however, whether this is due to a decrease in angiotensin II (Ang-II) generation or is a consequence of elevated local levels of bradykinin. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of an ACE inhibitor (perindopril) and an Ang-II receptor antagonist (losartan) on fibrinolytic kinetics. We have examined the serum levels of the plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) before and after reaching the target blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) in 13 hypertensive patients receiving perindopril (mean age 40+/-11 years, 6 women, 7 men) and in 12 patients receiving losartan (mean age 38+/-9 years, 6 women, 6 men). We also compared the baseline fibrinolytic activity of hypertensive patients with that of 12 normotensive control persons (mean age 40+/-9 years, 6 women, 6 men). The mean basal plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, and sTM were significantly higher in the hypertensive patients than in normal controls (P<.005). The values of other analytes were similar in both groups. Increased plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen, PAI-1 activity, and sTM were reduced in patients after they were given perindopril and losartan (P<.005); the reductions in losartan-receiving group were more pronounced (P<.05). There were no significant effects on the plasma levels of t-PA antigen, t-PA activity, and TFPI in patients receiving the two therapeutic regimens (P>.05). In conclusion, chronic hypertension is associated with hypofibrinolysis. The beneficial effect of ACE inhibitors on fibrinolysis seems to be related to the blockade of Ang-II, and increased kinin activity does not appear to play a major role.",

    "677": "1. Hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in rats (10% O2, 4 weeks) is characterized by changes in pulmonary vascular structure and function. The effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (oral gavage, once daily for the 4 weeks of hypoxia) on these changes were examined. 2. Perindopril (30 mg kg-1 d-1) caused an 18% reduction in pulmonary artery pressure in hypoxic rats. 3. Structural changes (remodelling) in hypoxic rats included increases in (i) critical closing pressure in isolated perfused lungs (remodelling of arteries <50 microm o.d.) and (ii) medial wall thickness of intralobar pulmonary arteries, assessed histologically (vessels 30 - 100 and 101 - 500 microm o.d.). Perindopril 10 and 30 mg kg-1 d-1 attenuated remodelling in vessels < or = 100 microm (lungs and histology), 30 mg kg-1 d-1 was effective in vessels 101 - 500 microm but neither dose prevented hypertrophy of main pulmonary artery. 3 mg kg-1 d-1 was without effect. 4. Perindopril (30 mg kg-1 d-1) prevented the exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstrictor response seen in perfused lungs from hypoxic rats but did not prevent any of the functional changes (i.e. the increased contractions to 5-HT, U46619 (thromboxane-mimetic) and K+ and diminished contractions to angiotensins I and II) seen in isolated intralobar or main pulmonary arteries. Acetylcholine responses were unaltered in hypoxic rats. 5. We conclude that, in hypoxic rats, altered pulmonary vascular function is largely independent of remodelling. Hence any drug that affects only remodelling is unlikely to restore pulmonary vascular function to normal and, like perindopril, may have only a modest effect on pulmonary artery pressure.", 
    "678": "Enalapril treatment (20 mg every 12 hours) of 24 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy established normal blood pressures after 8 weeks, and after 5 years, it had reduced LV mass index by 39% (from 148+/-34 to 90+/-16 g/m(2)) and had normalized LV structure and function and QT dispersion. Stepwise reduction of the enalapril dosage from 40 to 30, 20, 10, and 5 mg/d during the eighth year caused no significant change in blood pressure, LV structure, LV systolic function, or QT dispersion, which all likewise remained unaltered during an additional 2-year period of the 5-mg/d regimen. We conclude that for hypertensive patients in whom prolonged treatment with high doses of enalapril has normalized blood pressure, LV structure, LV function, and QT dispersion, the dose may be reduced as much as 8-fold without detriment to cardiovascular control. The use of smaller doses is evidently advantageous from the point of view of health costs.", 
    "679": "The level of renal blood flow (RBF) is controlled by opposing vasoconstrictor and vasodilator influences. In a recent investigation in normotensive dogs, we found that combined blockade of endothelin type A (ET(A)) receptors and angiotensin II formation induces marked increases in RBF that were much larger than the effects of blocking either system alone. The aim of the present study was to determine the contribution of nitric oxide (NO) to this vasodilator response. Experiments were made in 6 conscious, chronically instrumented dogs subjected to 5 different experimental treatments on separate days. Blockade of ET(A) receptors alone by the selective antagonist LU 135252 had only minor effects on RBF compared with time-control experiments. Additional blockade of angiotensin II formation by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition with trandolaprilat caused a substantial increase of RBF by approximately 50%. This vasodilation was entirely suppressed when NO formation was prevented by inhibition of NO synthase with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester HCl. However, when during NO synthase inhibition renal vascular NO concentrations were clamped at control levels by infusing the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine, the vasodilator response to combined blockade of ET(A) receptors and angiotensin II formation was completely restored (DeltaRBF approximately 60%). These results indicate that the vasodilation after combined ET(A) receptor blockade and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is not mediated by an increase in NO release but results from the unmasking of the tonic influence that is normally exerted by constitutively released NO. Accordingly, the tonic activity of endothelial NO synthase appears to be of major importance in the physiological regulation of renal vascular resistance by determining the vasomotor responses to endothelin and angiotensin II.", 
    "680": "To determine whether kinin receptor expression is regulated by kinins, prostaglandins, and/or nitric oxide (NO), rabbits were treated with a B(1) receptor (B(1)R) antagonist, a B2 receptor (B2R) antagonist, a prostacyclin mimetic, or inhibitors of NO synthase, cyclooxygenase, or angiotensin-converting enzyme. The mRNA concentrations for B1R and B2R (multiplex RT-PCR) were measured in several organs. The B2R mRNA expression was not significantly upregulated by any of the treatments; it was notably downregulated by angiotensin-converting enzyme or cyclooxygenase blockade or B2R antagonism in the heart and duodenum. A treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known to induce B1R expression, has also been applied and was the most consistent in upregulating the expression of B1R mRNA (kidney, duodenum, and striated muscle). The contractile responses mediated by kinin receptors in blood vessels isolated from the treated rabbits also indicated that LPS was the only B1R inducer (aorta). Icatibant, a nonequilibrium antagonist of the rabbit B2R, was the sole tested drug to alter the contractions mediated by the B2R in the jugular vein or the intensity of the immunohistochemical B2R staining in several organs (inhibition in both cases). B2R mRNA expression was downregulated in some organs by several of the applied treatments, but the data did not support generally applicable feedback for the regulation of B2R expression involving endogenous kinins, prostanoids, or NO. There was no indication of compensatory or reciprocal regulation of B1Rs, relative to B2Rs, inasmuch as B1R expression was restricted to LPS-treated animals.", 
    "681": "Recent works from this laboratory demonstrated potent inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril [B. D. Uhal, C. Gidea, R. Bargout, A. Bifero, O. Ibarra-Sunga, M. Papp, K. Flynn, and G. Filippatos. Am. J. Physiol. 275 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 19): L1013-L1017, 1998] and induction of dose-dependent apoptosis in AECs by purified angiotensin (ANG) II [R. Wang, A. Zagariya, O. Ibarra-Sunga, C. Gidea, E. Ang, S. Deshmukh, G. Chaudhary, J. Baraboutis, G. Filippatos and B. D. Uhal. Am. J. Physiol. 276 (Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 20): L885-L889, 1999]. These findings led us to hypothesize that the synthesis and binding of ANG II to its receptor might be involved in the induction of AEC apoptosis by Fas. Apoptosis was induced in the AEC-derived human lung carcinoma cell line A549 or in primary AECs isolated from adult rats with receptor-activating anti-Fas antibodies or purified recombinant Fas ligand, respectively. Apoptosis in response to either Fas activator was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the nonthiol ACE inhibitor lisinopril or the nonselective ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin, with maximal inhibitions of 82 and 93% at doses of 0.5 and 5 microg/ml, respectively. In both cell types, activation of Fas caused a significant increase in the abundance of mRNA for angiotensinogen (ANGEN) that was unaffected by saralasin. Transfection with antisense oligonucleotides against ANGEN mRNA inhibited the subsequent induction of Fas-stimulated apoptosis by 70% in A549 cells and 87% in primary AECs (both P < 0.01). Activation of Fas increased the concentration of ANG II in the serum-free extracellular medium 3-fold in primary AECs and 10-fold in A549 cells. Apoptosis in response to either Fas activator was completely abrogated by neutralizing antibodies specific for ANG II (P < 0.01), but isotype-matched nonimmune immunoglobulins had no significant effect. These data indicate that the induction of AEC apoptosis by Fas requires a functional renin-angiotensin system in the target cell. They also suggest that therapeutic control of AEC apoptosis is feasible through pharmacological manipulation of the local renin-angiotensin system.",

The cultured human fibroblast strains most active in producing the apoptotic activity contained high numbers of stellate cells expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin, a myofibroblast marker. The apoptotic activity eluted from gel-filtration columns only in fractions corresponding to proteins. Western blotting of the protein fraction identified immunoreactive angiotensinogen (ANGEN), and two-step RT-PCR revealed expression of ANGEN by HIPF fibroblasts but not by normal human lung fibroblasts. Specific ELISA detected angiotensin II (ANG II) at concentrations sixfold higher in HIPF-conditioned medium than in normal fibroblast-conditioned medium. Pretreatment of the concentrated medium with purified renin plus purified angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) further increased the ELISA-detectable ANG II eightfold. Apoptosis of AECs in response to HIPF-conditioned medium was completely abrogated by the ANG II receptor antagonist saralasin (50 microg/ml) or anti-ANG II antibodies. These results identify the protein inducers of AEC apoptosis produced by HIPF fibroblasts as ANGEN and its derivative ANG II. They also suggest a mechanism for AEC death adjacent to HIPF myofibroblasts [B. D. Uhal, I. Joshi, C. Ramos, A. Pardo, and M. Selman. Am. J. Physiol. 275 (Lung Cell. Mol.

    "683": "Chronic treatment with beta-receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in heart failure can reduce mortality and improve left ventricular function, but the mechanisms involved in their beneficial action remain to be fully defined. Our hypothesis was that these agents prevent the derangement of cardiac energy metabolism. Rats were subjected to myocardial infarction (MI) or sham operation. Thereafter, animals were treated with bisoprolol, captopril, or remained untreated. Two months later, cardiac function was measured in the isolated heart by a left ventricular balloon (pressure-volume curves), and energy metabolism of residual intact myocardium was analyzed in terms of total and isoenzyme creatine kinase (CK) activity, steady-state levels (ATP, phosphocreatine), and turnover rates (CK reaction velocity) of high-energy phosphates (31P nuclear magnetic resonance) and total creatine content (HPLC). Bisoprolol and partially captopril prevented post-MI hypertrophy and partially prevented left ventricular contractile dysfunction. Residual intact failing myocardium in untreated, infarcted hearts showed a 25% decrease of the total, a 26% decrease of MM-, and a 37% decrease of the mitochondrial CK activity. Total creatine was reduced by 15%, phosphocreatine by 21%, and CK reaction velocity by 41%. Treatment with bisoprolol or captopril largely prevented all of these changes in infarcted hearts. Thus the favorable functional effects of beta-receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors post-MI are accompanied by substantial beneficial effects on cardiac energy metabolism.", 
    "684": "Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is associated with an increased risk of ventricular dysrhythmia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and peripheral artery disease. The prevalence of LVH increases strongly with advancing age and, consequently, the prevention or reduction of LVH should be an important consideration in the older age-group. This review summarises current knowledge on LVH and discusses management issues with particular reference to the elderly. Evidence suggests that antihypertensive treatment can reverse or prevent LVH. There have been few studies of LVH in the elderly, but since age does not appear to be a factor in the regression of LVH, results of studies among younger hypertensive patients can be extrapolated to the elderly population. Meta-analyses of clinical studies have not established conclusively that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium antagonists are necessarily more effective than diuretics and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in reducing LVH.",

We present a 21-year old female with a history of asthma since one year of age who developed symptoms and signs of pneumonia, a pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiography and eosinophilia. This was followed a few weeks later by vasculitis which affected the skin and myocardium and associated with a peripheral eosinophilia of more than 80%. Physical examination revealed palpable purpura and signs of left ventricular failure. Echocardiography confirmed significant diminution of left ventricular contractility. A rapid improvement was observed after steroid therapy. Echocardiography after two months showed normal left ventricular function.

Late potentials were considered to be present in QRS duration (QRS) was > 114 ms or root mean square of last 40 ms (RMS40) was < 20 microV or terminal signal duration under 40 microV (LAS40) was > 38 ms at 40 Hz. At the beginning of study the prevalence of abnormal SAEG parameters was similar in both groups.

We performed body plethysmography for total airways resistance (Rtot), and static lung volumes (TLC, ITGV and RV), spirometry for FEV1 and FVC and we measured flow parameters (PEF, FEF). We compared initial lung function (first examination) with results after 3 months treatment (second examination) in the enalapril and in the placebo group. Mean values of Rtot, ITGV and RV did not differ significantly in the enalapril group or in the placebo group before and after treatment but FVC, FEV1 and FEF50 were significantly lower in the enalapril group and did not change in the placebo group after three months.

Using outflow gradients >10 mmHg and the presence of asymmetrical septal hypertrophy of the left ventricle as inclusion criteria, 122 patients were identified among patients referred for echocardiographic examinations between May 1990 and October 1996. Clinical, echocardiographical and follow-up data were compared between male and female patients. The female patients were significantly older than male patients (mean age +/-SD 66.7+/-10.5 vs 54.8+/-12.5 years). The female patients had a smaller interventricular septal wall thickness, less frequent systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve, more frequent association with hypertension, and less frequent association with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and giant T wave inversion. In this study population, adult female patients presented with OHCM 12 years later than males. Whether this represents female patients' reluctance to seek medical attention early, a different disease process that affects predominantly elderly females, or a gender-specific end organ response to aging, hypertension, IHD and other processes, or the protective effects of estrogen remains to be determined.", 
    "692": "Nephrosis induced by doxorubicin (adriamycin) is an experimental model of glomerulosclerosis with relative stable proteinuria which is commonly used for pharmacological intervention studies. It is induced by a single or a double dose of doxorubicin, with doses that vary considerably among investigators from 2 to 7.5 mg/kg. Intervention studies with ACE-inhibitors in this model have provided conflicting results. We hypothesized that these discrepancies might be due to different properties of the doxorubicin model, related to the dose of doxorubicin used to induce proteinuria. We tested this hypothesis by inducing doxorubicin nephrosis with 1, 2 and 3 mg/kg, and evaluating the response to intervention with lisinopril. The 1-mg/kg doxorubicin dose did not induce significant proteinuria. The 2- and the 3-mg/ kg dose resulted in a proteinuria of 684+/-215 mg/24 h and 736+/-277 mg/24 h 6 weeks after induction, respectively (Mean+/-SD). Treatment with lisinopril 2 mg/kg/day reduced proteinuria to 160+/-170 mg/24 h(p<0.01) in the 2-mg/kg doxorubicin group, whereas in the 3-mg/kg doxorubicin group, proteinuria did not respond to lisinopril (529+/-264 mg/24 h). In time control rats, proteinuria remained stable. Renal damage developed in both time control groups, with a glomerulosclerosis score of 29+/-22 in the 2-mg/kg group and 84+/-41 in the 3-mg/kg doxorubicin group. Lisinopril resulted in a significantly lower glomerulosclerosis score in the 2-mg/kg doxorubicin group only (16+/-15, p<0.05), whereas the 3-mg/kg group showed no significant reduction (56+/-29, NS). In conclusion, the dose of doxorubicin used to induce nephrosis is an important determinant not only of the severity of the ensuring renal damage, but also of the response to intervention by ACE-inhibition. These findings have an impact on the interpretation of intervention studies in this model.", 
    "693": "Vasopeptidase inhibitors are single molecules that inhibit neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) simultaneously. Omapatrilat, the first in this new class of cardiovascular agents, potentiates vasodilatory and cardioprotective peptides and represses angiotensin II. This study compared the effects of omapatrilat with those of a pure ACE inhibitor on cardiac geometry and survival in animals with heart failure. BIO TO-2 cardiomyopathic hamsters (CMHs) in the early stages of dilated heart failure were treated with vehicle or maximal ACE inhibitory doses of captopril (750 micromol/kg/day) or omapatrilat (200 micromol/kg/day). Prolonged vasopeptidase inhibition increased median survival time after the start of treatment by 99 and 31% compared with vehicle and captopril, respectively (median survival times: 146, 221, and 290 days with vehicle, captopril, and omapatrilat, respectively; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). In similar CMHs, captopril or omapatrilat administered for 2 months significantly (p < 0.05) decreased heart weight, pulmonary congestion (lung weight), and left ventricular (LV) chamber volume compared with vehicle. Omapatrilat significantly increased LV mass-to-volume ratio compared with vehicle and captopril. Omapatrilat, but not captopril, significantly increased urinary atrial natriuretic peptide excretion, indicating NEP inhibition. Thus vasopeptidase inhibition with omapatrilat was more effective than ACE inhibition with captopril in preventing changes in LV geometry and premature mortality in hamsters with dilated heart failure.", 
    "694": "We investigated whether angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) and angiotensin II AT1-receptor blockade (AT1-) would exert beneficial additive effects on coronary hemodynamics and on cardiac remodeling in post-myocardial infarction (MI) heart failure in rats. Wistar rats with MI were treated daily for 6 weeks with either trandolapril (0.1 mg/kg), losartan (3 mg/kg), or their combination, after which coronary hemodynamics (basal and at maximal vasodilation, fluospheres), systemic hemodynamics, and cardiac remodeling were investigated. Neither trandolapril nor losartan (both in nonantihypertensive doses) nor their combination (which significantly decreased blood pressure) proved to be effective at improving MI-induced impairments of basal coronary hemodynamics and of coronary flow reserve, and at preventing cardiac fibrosis development. In contrast, both trandolapril and losartan significantly improved the hemodynamic status [e.g., left ventricular end diastolic pressure: -27% and -39%, urinary cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP): -37%, and -26%, respectively] and slightly limited cardiac hypertrophy (-5% and -3%, respectively), and, in their combination, tended to exert additive effects on these three parameters (-49, -42, and -10%, respectively). Thus whereas the ACEI/AT1- combination tended to exert additive effects on systemic hemodynamics and cardiac hypertrophy in post-MI heart failure rats, no such effect was found for coronary hemodynamics, probably in relation to the lack of prevention of cardiac fibrosis. We conclude that an early (6 weeks) drug-induced improvement in coronary hemodynamics does not contribute to the long-term survival prolongation observed in this experimental model after either ACEI or AT1-.", 
    "695": "Hypertension remains uncontrolled worldwide despite the availability of several classes of antihypertensive agents. There is an increased risk of serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal events if the disease goes untreated or is poorly treated. Thus, the high incidence of hypertension coupled with its poor control make it imperative that more effective and well-tolerated treatments that exhibit target-organ protection be developed. Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of cardiovascular agents that simultaneously inhibit neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme. They enhance peptides with vasodilatory and possibly organ-protective properties and also inhibit the production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. In preclinical studies, omapatrilat has shown blood pressure-lowering effects independent of renin status and has increased survival in an animal model of congestive heart failure. Human studies with omapatrilat, the most clinically advanced vasopeptidase inhibitor, administered orally once daily have demonstrated powerful dose-dependent reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, regardless of age, race, or gender. Omapatrilat is particularly effective in lowering systolic blood pressure; this article summarizes data from recent clinical trials. This drug is well tolerated, with adverse effects comparable to those of currently available antihypertensive agents. Omapatrilat and other vasopeptidase inhibitors have potential applications in the treatment of hypertension, heart failure, and other cardiac and vascular disorders.", 
    "696": "The effect of an endothelin (ET) A/ETB receptor antagonist, TAK-044, and/or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocaprilat, on myocardial metabolism and contraction during ischemia and reperfusion was examined by phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) in Langendorff rabbit hearts. After normothermic 15 min global ischemia, 60min of postischemic reperfusion was carried out. TAK-044 and/or temocaprilat was administered from 40 min prior to the global ischemia. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine phosphate, inorganic phosphate, pH, left ventricular systolic developed pressure (LVDev.P), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and coronary flow were measured. Twenty-eight hearts were divided into 4 experimental groups consisted of seven hearts each: Group I consisted of controls, Group II was perfused with TAK-044 (10(-6) mol/L), Group III was perfused with temocaprilat (10(-6) mol/L), and Group IV was perfused with TAK-044 (10(-6) mol/L) in combination with temocaprilat (10(-6) mol/L). Group II showed a more early recovery of ATP during postischemic reperfusion (82+/-3%) compared with Group I (71+/-3%). Group III showed a significant inhibition of the decrease in ATP during global ischemia (54+/-3%) compared with Group I (45+/-3%). Group IV also showed a significant marked inhibition of the decrease in ATP during global ischemia (59+/-5%) and a more significant improvement on recovery of ATP during postischemic reperfusion (86+/-3%) compared with the other 3 groups. There were no differences in LVDev.P, LVEDP and coronary flow among these groups. In conclusion, TAK-044 in combination with temocaprilat had a significant potentiation on myocardial metabolism during both ischemia and reperfusion.", 
    "697": "The influence of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on bradykinin-and angiotensin I-induced responses with special regard to nitric oxide (NO) was studied. Auxometric tension and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was studied in isolated porcine iliac arteries. Captopril potentiated bradykinin-induced contraction of preparations with intact endothelium; this potentiation was not seen with the kininase I inhibitor mergepta or a bradykinin B(1)-receptor antagonist. Captopril did not affect bradykinin-induced relaxation. The captopril-mediated increase of bradykinin-induced contraction was only seen in preparations with intact endothelium, while captopril did not affect arterial strips treated with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine. Angiotensin I-induced contractions was less reduced by captopril when the strips were pretreated with Nomega-nitro-L-arginine. Both captopril and the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine inhibited angiotensin-converting enzyme activity. An additional reduction in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was seen when S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine was added to captopril-treated preparations. In conclusion, captopril increased bradykinin-induced contraction in a NO-dependent manner. This potentiation is probably mediated by the increased metabolism of bradykinin by kininase I, and the additive angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory effect of captopril and NO.",

    "699": "Hypertension accelerates renal failure in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and evidence suggests a role for the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the functional and structural changes. To explore the hypothesis that RAS adaptations contribute to disease progression, we examined RAS activity and the long-term consequences of antihypertensive drugs, which suppress (enalapril) or stimulate (hydralazine) the RAS, in experimental polycystic kidney disease.", 
    "700": "Studies were conducted in male heterozygous cystic Han:SPRD rats (Cy/+) and in unaffected littermates (controls). In protocol 1, either angiotensin II (Ang II), enalaprilat, or saline vehicle was acutely infused into cystic and control rats, which were aged 10 to 12 weeks. The mean arterial pressure (MAP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and renal plasma flow (RPF) were measured at baseline and after an infusion of test substances. In protocol 2, cystic rats received chronic therapy with either enalapril, hydralazine, or no therapy for 10 to 12 weeks of age and then underwent renal function and RAS studies. In protocol 3, similar cohorts were followed for 40 weeks to assess the effects of therapy on blood pressure, proteinuria, serum creatinine, RAS parameters, and renal morphology.", 
    "701": "In protocol 1, cystic rats had massive kidneys, slightly elevated blood pressure, and profound renal vasoconstriction and reduced GFR. Ang II induced similar changes in MAP and renal function in control and cystic rats. Enalaprilat induced little effect on MAP but more striking increases in GFR and RPF in cystic rats. In protocol 2, at 10 weeks of age, enalapril was superior in preserving renal function, but neither drug limited the expansion of the tubulointerstitium. In protocol 3, at 40 weeks of age, both drugs ameliorated the increase in serum creatinine, although only enalapril reduced proteinuria and kidney size.", 
    "702": "In polycystic rats, acute RAS suppression markedly ameliorates renal dysfunction. However, although chronic enalapril and hydralazine protect against the loss of renal function, only enalapril limits renal growth and proteinuria, and neither significantly limits tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The long-term studies give clear support to the importance of blood pressure control, per se, but only partial support to the importance of the particular agent used. As in clinical studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition may be less beneficial in ADPKD than in renal diseases characterized by predominant glomerular injury.",

    "707": "The human renin infused rat model (HRIRM) was used as an in vivo small-animal model for evaluating the efficacy of a collection of inhibitors of human renin. The intravenous infusion of recombinant human renin (2.4 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) in the ganglion-blocked, nephrectomized rat produced a mean blood pressor response of 47+/-3 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 133.3 Pa), which was reduced by captopril, enalkiren, and losartan in a dose-dependent manner following oral administration, with ED50 values of 0.3+/-0.1, 2.5+/-0.9, and 5.2+/-1.6 mg/kg, respectively. A series of peptidomimetic P2-P3 butanediamide renin inhibitors inhibited purified recombinant human renin in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values ranging from 0.4 to 20 nM at pH 6.0, with a higher range of IC50 values (0.8-80 nM) observed at pH 7.4. Following i.v. administration of renin inhibitors, the pressor response to infused human renin in the HRIRM was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, with ED50 values ranging from 4 to 600 microg/kg. The in vivo inhibition of human renin following i.v. administration in the rat correlated significantly better with the in vitro inhibition of human renin at pH 7.4 (r = 0.8) compared with pH 6.0 (r = 0.5). Oral administration of renin inhibitors also resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the pressor response to infused human renin, with ED50 values ranging from 0.4 to 6.0 mg/kg and the identification of six renin inhibitors with an oral potency of <1 mg/kg. The ED50 of renin inhibitors for inhibition of angiotensin I formation in vivo was highly correlated (r = 0.9) with the ED50 for inhibition of the pressor response. These results demonstrate the high potency, dose dependence, and availability following oral administration of the butanediamide series of renin inhibitors.", 
    "708": "The aim of the present study was to investigate whether exogenous angiotensin I (AngI) is locally converted to angiotensin II (AngII), which in turn results in an increase in the adrenal catecholamine (CA) secretion in the adrenal gland in anesthetized dogs. Plasma CA concentrations in adrenal venous and aortic blood were determined by an HPLC-electrochemical method. Adrenal venous blood flow was measured by gravimetry. Local administration of AngI (0.0062 to 6.2 microg, 0.0096 to 9.6 microM) to the left adrenal gland resulted in significant increases in CA output in a dose-dependent manner. Following administration of 0.62 microg (0.96 microM) of AngI, adrenal epinephrine and norepinephrine outputs increased from 20.8+/-13.6 to 250.9+/-96.4 ng x min(-1) x g(-1) (p<0.05, n = 5) and from 2.8+/-1.7 to 29.6+/-11.1 ng x min(-1) x g(-1) (p<0.05, n = 5), respectively. From the same left adrenal gland, the output of AngII increased from -0.02+/-0.04 to 26.39+/-11.38 ng x min(-1) x g(-1) (p<0.05, n = 5), while plasma concentrations of AngII in aortic blood remained unchanged. In dogs receiving captopril (12.5 microg, 0.5 mM) 10 min prior to AngI, the net amounts of CA and AngII secreted during the first 3 min after AngI were diminished by about 80% (p<0.05, n = 5) compared with those obtained from the control group. There was a close correlation (r2 = 0.91, n = 6) between the net increases in AngII and CA outputs induced by AngI. The results indicate that the local angiotensin converting enzyme is functionally involved in regional AngII formation in the canine adrenal gland in vivo. The study suggests that AngII thus generated may play a role in the local regulation of adrenal CA secretion.", 
    "709": "This study was carried out to determine the proliferation profile of the smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the media of the ductus arteriosus (DA) and the descending aorta (Ao), and to examine the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on the proliferation of these cells in perinatal rats. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) index of the DA peaked in 19-day-old fetuses at 75%, and the index significantly declined in 20-day-old fetuses. The PCNA index of the Ao showed a similar profile until pups reached 1 day of age; however, the index of the Ao then increased in 3-day-old pups. The PCNA indices of the DA and Ao decreased significantly after maternal oral treatment with enalapril (10 mg/kg for 7 days), with a more marked decline in the DA than in the Ao. The PCNA indices of these vessels in 20-day-old fetuses were not altered by maternal treatment with enalapril. These results indicate that the SMC proliferation rate in the DA was similar to that in the Ao until pups reached the age of 1 day, and that the inhibitory effect of enalapril on the SMC proliferation was age-dependent and more prominent in the DA than in the Ao.",

Tightly specified goals for secondary prevention are now more rigorous than ever before and should be reached by all patients. After acute myocardial infarction, patients require beta-blockers, aspirin, lipid-lowering agents and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Psychosocial adjustment problems are common in cardiac patients and their families, but these can be significantly reduced by appropriate rehabilitation strategies. Patients with additional needs should be identified (e.g., some working patients require work assessment, employer contact, additional exercise and specified return-to-work guidelines).", 
    "711": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are generally prescribed by physicians in doses lower than the large doses that have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure.

When compared with the low-dose group, patients in the high-dose group had a nonsignificant 8% lower risk of death (P=0.128) but a significant 12% lower risk of death or hospitalization for any reason (P=0.002) and 24% fewer hospitalizations for heart failure (P=0.002). Dizziness and renal insufficiency was observed more frequently in the high-dose group, but the 2 groups were similar in the number of patients requiring discontinuation of the study medication. Conclusions-These findings indicate that patients with heart failure should not generally be maintained on very low doses of an ACE inhibitor (unless these are the only doses that can be tolerated) and suggest that the difference in efficacy between intermediate and high doses of an ACE inhibitor (if any) is likely to be very small.", 
    "713": "The present study describes methodology and its application to evaluate renal reactivity in acute studies on anesthetized mice. Renal blood flow (RBF) was measured using an ultrasonic transit-time flowmeter and a non-cannulating V-shaped probe. An intrarenal artery injection technique established feasibility and reproducibility of studies of renal vascular reactivity to angiotensin II (AngII) in adult wild-type mice. The study also examined whether AngII would affect RBF in mice lacking AT1A receptors due to gene targeting. Mean arterial pressure averaged 83 and 62 mmHg, respectively, in mice with and without AT1A receptors. The RBF was similar in both groups, averaging 7 ml/min per g kidney wt. AngII injection (10-microl bolus) into the renal artery produced transient, dose-dependent, selective reductions in RBF in AT1A knockout mice as well as wild-type mice. The response was considerably greater in mice with AT1A receptors: 10% for 0.1 ng, 30% for 1 ng, and 45% for 5 ng AngII in control animals versus respective decreases of 6, 15, and 17% in knockout mice. In other studies, angiotensin-converting enzyme (captopril) or renin (CP-71362-14) was inhibited. During inhibition of AngII formation, renal vascular reactivity to AngII increased twofold in both groups. Coadministration of the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan (1 to 1000 ng) elicited dose-dependent inhibition of AngII effects, with near maximum blockage of 80 to 90% in both groups of mice. The putative AT2 receptor antagonist PD 123319 inhibited 30 to 40% of AngII-induced vasoconstriction, whereas CGP 42112 had no effect in either group. In conclusion, AngII can elicit renal vasoconstriction, albeit attenuated, in AT1A knockout mice. The weaker RBF effects are most likely due to the absence of the AT1A receptor. Inhibition of the response by AT1 receptor antagonist suggests mediation by the AT1B receptor in these animals. The residual constrictor effect observed during AT1 receptor blockade and sensitive to PD 123319 appears to be mediated by a non-AT1 receptor.", 
    "714": "The use of angiotensin II receptor subtype-1 antagonists (ARA), recently introduced as antihypertensive drugs, is becoming more prevalent. We studied the prevalence and severity of hypotension after the induction of general anesthesia in 12 patients treated with ARA until the morning of surgery. The hemodynamic response to induction was compared with that of patients treated with beta-adrenergic blockers (BB) and/or calcium channel blockers (CB) (BB/CB group, n = 45) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) (ACEI group, n = 27). A standardized anesthesia induction protocol was followed for all patients. Hypotension occurred significantly (p < or = 0.05) more often in ARA-treated patients (12 of 12) compared with BB/CB-treated patients (27 of 45) or with ACEI-treated patients (18 of 27). There was a significantly (P < or = 0.001) increased ephedrine requirement in the ARA group (21+/-3 mg) compared with the BB/CB group (10+/-6 mg) or the ACEI group (7+/-4 mg). Hypotension refractory to repeated ephedrine or phenylephrine administration occurred significantly (P < or = 0.05) more in the ARA group (4 of 12) compared with the BB/CB group (0 of 45) or the ACEI group (1 of 27), but it was treated successfully by using a vasopressin system agonist. Treatment with angiotensin II antagonism until the day of surgery is associated with severe hypotension after the induction of anesthesia, which, in some cases, can only be treated with an agonist of the vasopressin system.", 
    "715": "Hypotensive episodes occur more frequently after anesthetic induction in patients receiving Angiotensin II receptor subtype-1 antagonists under anesthesia than with other hypotensive drugs. They are less responsive to the vasopressors ephedrine and phenylephrine.

    "716": "Liver disease can modify the kinetics of drugs biotransformed by the liver. This review updates recent developments in this field, with particular emphasis on cytochrome P450 (CYP). CYP is a rapidly expanding area in clinical pharmacology. The information currently available on specific isoforms involved in drug metabolism has increased tremendously over the latest years, but knowledge remains incomplete. Studies on the effects of liver disease on specific isoenzymes of CYP have shown that some isoforms are more susceptible than others to liver disease. A detailed knowledge of the particular isoenzyme involved in the metabolism of a drug and the impact of liver disease on that enzyme can provide a rational basis for dosage adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment. The capacity of the liver to metabolise drugs depends on hepatic blood flow and liver enzyme activity, both of which can be affected by liver disease. In addition, liver failure can influence the binding of a drug to plasma proteins. These changes can occur alone or in combination; when they coexist their effect on drug kinetics is synergistic, not simply additive. The kinetics of drugs with a low hepatic extraction are sensitive to hepatic failure rather than to liver blood flow changes, but drugs having a significant first-pass effect are sensitive to alterations in hepatic blood flow. The drugs examined in this review are: cardiovascular agents (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcium antagonists, ketanserin, antiarrhythmics and hypolipidaemics), diuretics (torasemide), psychoactive and anticonvulsant agents (benzodiazepines, flumazenil, antidepressants and tiagabine), antiemetics (metoclopramide and serotonin antagonists), antiulcers (acid pump inhibitors), anti-infectives and antiretroviral agents (grepafloxacin, ornidazole, pefloxacin, stavudine and zidovudine), immunosuppressants (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), naltrexone, tolcapone and toremifene. According to the available data, the kinetics of many drugs are altered by liver disease to an extent that requires dosage adjustment; the problem is to quantify the required changes. Obviously, this requires the evaluation of the degree of hepatic impairment. At present there is no satisfactory test that gives a quantitative measure of liver function and its impairment. A critical evaluation of these methods is provided. Guidelines providing a rational basis for dosage adjustment are illustrated. Finally, it is important to consider that liver disease not only affects pharmacokinetics but also pharmacodynamics. This review also examines drugs with altered pharmacodynamics.", 
    "717": "Locally increased synthesis of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the kidney has been linked to glomerular hypertrophy, glomerulosclerosis and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis observed in chronic renal failure after subtotal nephrectomy. This action of ANG II is thought to be mediated mainly by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which stimulates the synthesis and decreases the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, including various collagen types and fibronectin. Some recent reports indicate that reduced ANG II activity diminishes TGF-beta overexpression, and in consequence renal injury. However, no studies in SNx models concerning the influence of ANG II on gene expression regulated by TGF-beta have so far been performed. Therefore, the present study has been initiated with the following aims: 1. To develop a RT-PCR assay for evaluating gene expression concerning renin (REN), angiotensinogen (ATG) and the following ECM components: transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), fibronectin (FN), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2); 2. To assess the influence of renal mass reduction (RMR) caused by subtotal (5/6) or partial (2/6) nephrectomy on gene expression for TGF-beta 1, FN, MMP-2 and TIMP-2; 3. To evaluate the correlation between expression of these genes and activity of the circulatory or renal renin-angiotensin systems; 4. To assess the influence of treatment with enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) on renal expression of these genes, renal morphology and function in rats, relative to duration of treatment and RMR. The study consisted of two independent experiments performed in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Ten days prior to surgery, the animals were matched for body weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) values and subsequently were distributed into untreated (control) and enalapril treated groups. Treatment with enalapril (EN) (50 mg/l in drinking water) was started 9 days prior to surgery. The first (short-term) experiment was performed in rats with chronic renal failure caused by subtotal nephrectomy. Remnant kidneys were taken for molecular studies at the day of SNx and 3, 7 and 21 days thereafter. Blood samples collected at the time of sacrifice served to determine plasma renin activity and plasma concentration of angiotensinogen and angiotensin II. The second (long-term) experiment was done in subtotally (5/6) and partially (2/6) nephrectomized rats. Remnant kidneys were taken for molecular and morphological studies at the day of surgery and 1 or 16 weeks thereafter. 24-hour proteinuria, hematocrit, serum creatinine and creatinine clearance values were also measured. Quantitation of renal gene expression for REN, ATG, TGF-beta 1, FN, MMP-2 and TIMP-2 was performed using RT-PCR assay and comparing amounts of respective gene mRNA with house-keeping gene mRNA encoding L19 ribosomal protein. The results obtained have led to the following conclusions: 1. The RT-PCR assay developed here ensures a reliable quantitation of gene expression for renin, angiotensinogen, transforming growth factor-beta 1, fibronectin, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2. 2. Renin gene expression in the kidney depends on renal synthesis of angiotensin II. In contrast, regulation of angiotensinogen mRNA expression seems to be independent of ANG II. 3. Long-term treatment with enalapril prevents an early increase in renal TGF-beta 1 and FN gene expression, retards the progression of chronic renal failure caused by critical renal mass reduction, and prolongs survival. 4. Intrarenal activity of the renin-angiotensin system is not a principal factor in the regulation of gene transcription for matrix metalloproteinase-2 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2.",

    "723": "Experiments were undertaken to determine whether angiotensin (Ang) II concentration increases during massive sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation and whether such an increase plays a role in the pathogenesis of SNS-induced left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. We also sought to determine whether excessive Ca2+ uptake through L-type channels due to intense adrenoceptor activation is responsible for the LV dysfunction. AngII concentration was measured in the plasma and myocardium before and after massively activating the SNS with an intracisternal injection of veratrine. In separate experiments, rabbits were given losartan, enalaprilat, enalaprilat plus HOE-140, nifedipine, -Bay K 4866, or saline before massively activating the SNS. LV function was evaluated 2.5 h later. The intense SNS activity caused plasma and myocardial AngII to increase by 400 and 437%, respectively. AngII receptor blockade did not prevent LV dysfunction. In contrast, enalaprilat reduced the degree of dysfunction, but its cardioprotection was abolished by HOE-140. Although nifedipine prevented SNS-induced LV dysfunction, administration of the Ca2+ channel opener, -Bay K 4866, did not increase its severity. Our results indicate that AngII is not involved in the pathogenesis of SNS-induced LV dysfunction and that the cardioprotection provided by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition is due to activation of a bradykinin pathway. Furthermore, the finding that the magnitude of the LV dysfunction was reduced by enalaprilat, and not increased by -Bay K 4866, suggests that intense adrenoceptor activation of L-type Ca2+ channels is not the primary pathogenetic mechanism.", 
    "724": "Our objective was to determine if the ability of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor to attenuate neointima formation in balloon-damaged vessel is expressed in an isolated organ culture model of neointimal growth. In vivo balloon angioplasty in combination with in vitro organ culture was used to produce a unique model of vascular neointima formation. Aortic segments were cultured in medium containing a broad concentration range of the ACE inhibitor enalaprilat (0-100 microM). Cell proliferative indices and neointima:media thickness ratios were determined from vessel segments after 1, 4, and 7 days in culture. We observed no significant effect on either parameter at any dose of enalaprilat. Linear regression analysis on the rate of increase in intima to media thickness ratios during the 7 days of culture also showed no effect of enalaprilat at any concentration. We conclude that enalaprilat has no effect on neointimal growth or cell proliferation in this vascular organ culture model, and it is suggested that ACE inhibitors may act by mechanisms other than local converting enzyme inhibition to attenuate neointimal growth in rabbits following vascular ballooning in vivo.",

Modern paediatric care, with early detection and treatment of urinary tract infections and reflux during childhood and adolescence, may improve long-term prognosis.

    "728": "Patients with chronic heart failure (n = 39) were randomized to regimens of ACEI nonadherence for one week, ACEI adherence for one week or two versions of partial adherence for one week, after which the above six tests were performed.", 
    "729": "All six tests significantly distinguished between full nonadherence for one week and full or partial adherence. Only plasma AcSDKP produced a significantly different result between partial adherence and either full adherence or full nonadherence for one week. In terms of their ability to distinguish full nonadherence from full adherence, plasma AcSDKP was 89% sensitive and 100% specific with an area under its ROC of 0.95. Corresponding figures for urine AcSDKP were 92%, 97% and 0.95 and for serum ACE they were 86%, 95% and 0.90.", 
    "730": "All six tests distinguished full nonadherence from all other forms of adherence. The rank order of performance was plasma AcSDKP, urine AcSDKP, serum ACE, AII/AI ratio and plasma AII followed by plasma AI."
